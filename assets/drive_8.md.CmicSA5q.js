In the months following Pink Moon's release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant. He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone.

Barron initially accused Lohan of 'masterminding the alleged attack' Paris' brother is now said to be planning to sue both Lohan and LeMoine. LeMoine is now said to be 'on the run from authorities... and is attempting to seek refuge in Cuba'","output":"Title: The Imminent Disturbance: How LeMoine's Arrest is Churning Waves in Celebrity Circles Introduction Law enforcement sources have recently stated that the arrest of Ray LeMoine is 'imminent,' following allegations made by Barron Hilton - brother of Paris Hilton - that actress Lindsay Lohan had 'masterminded the alleged attack' on him. The situation is further complicated by reports that LeMoine, now considered a fugitive, is attempting to evade the authorities by seeking refuge in Cuba. With Barron planning to sue both Lohan and LeMoine, the case continues to gain prominence amidst the ongoing turbulence in Hollywood's elite circles. The Mastermind Controversy The alleged incident involving Barron Hilton and Lindsay Lohan has been one of the most controversial episodes within the Hollywood community in recent times. According to numerous reports, Barron, who is Paris Hilton's younger brother, has accused the Mean Girls actress of orchestrating an attack on him in Miami late last year. It was claimed that Lohan had instructed her close acquaintance, Ray LeMoine, to assault Barron in an altercation that left the young Hilton sibling with several bruises and cuts. Despite initial denials from Lohan and her representatives, several witnesses have come forward claiming to have seen the actress egging LeMoine on during the attack. This has understandably increased the pressure on law enforcement agencies to arrest those involved and bring them to justice. Imminent Arrest and Legal Battle With mounting evidence against both Lohan and LeMoine, the authorities have declared that the arrest of LeMoine is now imminent, with several law enforcement sources stating that they are closing in on the perpetrator. The arrest is expected to have a significant impact on Lohan's career, who has been making strides toward revitalizing her public image in recent years. Meanwhile, Paris Hilton's brother is reportedly preparing to take legal action against both Lohan and LeMoine. If found guilty, the two celebrities could face substantial financial penalties as well as further damage to their already tarnished reputations. The Fugitive: LeMoine's Escape to Cuba As the net slowly tightens around him, reports suggest that Ray LeMoine is currently 'on the run from authorities' and is attempting to seek refuge in Cuba. Cuba has a complex legal relationship with the United States, making it a potential safe haven for fugitives looking to escape the arm of the law. While the details of LeMoine's potential escape plan are still murky, it is clear that both law enforcement agencies and the Hilton family will be keeping a close eye on developments in the case. If LeMoine is apprehended, it could act as a new chapter in the legal battle against Lindsay Lohan and her alleged involvement in the attack. Conclusion: While facts surrounding the case continue to emerge, the imminent arrest of Ray LeMoine and the potential lawsuit against both him and Lohan by Barron Hilton has the potential to significantly reshape the careers, lives, and reputations of all parties involved. As LeMoine allegedly plans his escape to Cuba, the implications of such developments are sure to send shockwaves throughout Hollywood's elite circles and add yet another complex layer to an already complicated set of circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Most people think that the older you get, the harder it is to learn a new language. That is, they believe that children learn more easily and efficiently than adults. Thus, at some point in our lives, maybe around age 12 or 13, we lose the ability to learn languages well. Is this idea a fact or myth ? Is it true that children learn a foreign language more efficiently than adults? On the contrary, research studies suggest that the opposite may be true. One report, on 2,000 Danish children studying Swedish, concluded that the teenagers learned more, in less time, than the younger children. Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age range tested; that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood. There are several possible explanations for these findings. For one thing, adults know more about the world and therefore are able to understand meanings more easily than children. Moreover, adults can use logical  thinking to help themselves see patterns in the language. Finally, adults have more self-discipline (self-control) than children.

She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves).

Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

In both sentences, the word \\"bear\\" is used as a verb; however, the context and meaning of the word are different in each sentence. Let's examine these uses further: 1. Bear a resemblance: In this sentence, \\"bear\\" is used to mean \\"to have or exhibit a similar appearance or quality.\\" The phrase \\"bear a resemblance\\" is often used to describe similarities between people, objects, or features. In this case, \\"bear\\" implies the act of possessing or presenting similar characteristics with someone or something else. 2. The unidentified plant bore gorgeous flowers: In this sentence, \\"bear\\" is used in the context of producing or yielding something, in this case, flowers.

Megan's memory is a lot sharper than Rebecca's is due to","output":"several factors that contribute to the differences in their cognitive abilities. These factors can be broadly categorized into genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and cognitive factors that interact in various ways to shape an individual's memory and cognitive proficiency. 1. Genetic factors: Genetics play a significant role in determining a person's memory capacity and cognitive skills. Megan may have inherited strong genetic traits from her parents that contribute to a superior memory. On the other hand, Rebecca's genetic makeup may not be as strongly inclined toward an enhanced memory, making a difference in their cognitive abilities. 2. Environmental factors: The environment in which Megan and Rebecca were raised can be another crucial factor for the difference in their memory. If Megan was exposed to a stimulating and engaging environment from an early age, her brain would have developed stronger neural connections necessary for better memory retention. In contrast, Rebecca might not have had the same level of exposure to fruitful environmental stimuli, leading to her weaker memory compared to Megan's. 3. Lifestyle factors: The impact of lifestyle on memory and cognitive skills cannot be overemphasized. Factors like proper nutrition, regular exercise, and quality sleep contribute significantly to brain health and cognitive prowess. Megan might have maintained a healthy lifestyle, allowing her brain to function optimally and, in turn, enhancing her memory. On the contrary, Rebecca could have neglected essential lifestyle practices, putting her at a disadvantage when it comes to memory and cognitive skills. 4. Cognitive training: Megan's superior memory could also be attributed to her proactive approach to cognitive training. She may have consistently engaged in activities like puzzles, memory games, and other mental exercises aimed at improving memory retention and cognitive flexibility. These practices eventually strengthened Megan's memory over time. At the same time, Rebecca might not have partaken in such activities, leading to the disparity in their cognitive capabilities. 5. Emotional wellbeing: Emotional health can have a considerable impact on memory and overall cognitive function. High levels of stress and anxiety can impair memory retention and recall. Megan might have an effective coping mechanism to deal with stress, ensuring her emotional wellbeing and, in turn, positively impacting her memory. On the other hand, Rebecca might struggle with emotional management, leading to a diminished memory capacity. 6. Interest and motivation: Lastly, the level of interest and motivation in acquiring new information can influence memory retention. If Megan is more motivated to learn and invests more effort into encoding and retaining information, her memory will naturally be sharper than Rebecca's. If Rebecca lacks the same enthusiasm or eagerness, her memory performance will suffer in comparison. In conclusion, Megan's sharper memory compared to Rebecca's can be attributed to a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, lifestyle, cognitive, emotional, and motivational factors. By understanding these factors and working on self-improvement in these areas, Rebecca might be able to enhance her memory and attune her cognitive skills to match Megan's level. However, it is important to remember that everyone's memory capacity and cognitive abilities are unique, and the focus should be on developing to one's full potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Letter to the Editor      John Sweeney      The News Journal      950 W. Basin Road      New Castle, DE 19720      Child sexual abuse cases are among the most serious cases a prosecutor handles. The harm to the victim is profound. A child is vulnerable, and never more so than when the perpetrator is a parent. Juxtaposed against the severity of the crime is the difficulty proving it in a court of law.      When a child reports sexual abuse, it is often that child’s word against the word of the alleged perpetrator. Authorities who receive reports of abuse ensure that children are interviewed by the Children’s Advocacy Center, where an expert questions the child. Often, however, the child has made previous statements to members of his or her family, and frequently those statements differ in some respects. This is particularly true with very young children, who are on the cusp of being capable of relating an event in detail. The younger the child, the less detailed the account is likely to be.      Authorities look for corroborating evidence to support the report of abuse. They search for forensic evidence, such as DNA. They look for medical evidence of abuse. When the abuse occurs on a date prior to the report and investigation, there is rarely forensic evidence available. Moreover, unless the abuse alleged is an act likely to inflict physical injury, evidence of medical trauma is likewise rare.      Therefore, in child sexual abuse cases, the sum total of the evidence is often the word of the child against the word of the alleged perpetrator. The State bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard in our justice system. For the State to meet that burden, the child must testify because a defendant has a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. This means that the child must testify in a sterile courtroom before a room full of strangers.      Before the child can even testify, the court must be satisfied that the child is competent, that is, whether the child knows the difference between right and wrong. This determination is made after the court questions the child.      Assuming the child is deemed competent, the child faces additional trauma by having to recount the abuse in front of the very person who committed it. Trials generally occur several months to a year after the event. All memories fade with time, a child’s in particular.      For these reasons, a prosecutor’s decision about whether to take a child sexual abuse case to trial or to resolve it through a negotiated plea requires the striking of a difficult balance. If the case proceeds to trial, and the jury returns a not guilty verdict, this means that the alleged perpetrator will walk away free, with no conditions attached. There will be no punishment. The defendant will not be required to register as a sex offender, will not be supervised by probation and parole, and will not receive sexual offense counseling. Indeed, he is free to resume his life, free to contact the child and to reenter the residence and resume his former life, absent a separate Family Court order to the contrary.      All of these considerations were in the mind of the prosecutor assigned to this case. This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility. The only eyewitness to the crime was the four year old victim. There was no medical or forensic evidence of any kind. The defendant did not make a statement to the police, although he made an ambiguous apology to the victim’s mother. A conviction would have required twelve jurors to find unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime had occurred.      In recognition of the weakness of the case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of sixteen. A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible.      The judge who considered the appropriate sentence in this case did so after careful deliberation with due regard for all of the circumstances. The Truth in Sentencing Guidelines, which judges use to inform their exercise of discretion, called for a sentence of 0 to 22 months in jail. The Defendant had already entered treatment. The Defendant accepted responsibility. These factors are listed in the Guidelines as mitigators that the Court must take into account. Moreover, the parties had agreed upon the recommendation to the Court. The judge acted properly by imposing a sentence that placed the Defendant under supervision for a lengthy period of time, required him to complete counseling, placed him on the sex offender registry and prevented him from contacting the victim and any other child. Judge Jurden is an outstanding jurist. She carefully considers the salient factors in all criminal cases without any regard for wealth or social status. In this case, Judge Jurden exercised sound discretion based solely on the merits of the case before her.      Nothing is more important than protecting children from harm. That is why I ran for office in the first place. One of my first acts in office was to create the Child Predator Task Force which, for the first time in Delaware, puts police and prosecutors side by side to identify and bring to justice the worst predators in society – those who seek to hurt Delaware’s children. This work has led to the convictions of more than 180 predators and the rescue of more than 120 children who were being abused or groomed for future abuse. This past year, with the help of the legislature, we created the Child Victims Unit to provide more effective investigation and prosecution of child death and injury cases. We have fought successfully for new laws that impose tough mandatory sentences on child pornographers, and this year, I am working with legislators to give kids targeted by predators even stronger protections.      I commend the hard working, dedicated prosecutors who strive to achieve justice in each and every case. We will continue to fight for children.      Sincerely,      Joseph R. Biden, III Attorney General ||||| Buy Photo Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden (Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Story Highlights Online petition seeking Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden's ouster has received more than 25,400 signatures.      But allies in the legal community, defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, have rallied to her defense.      Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden's decision to order probation instead of prison for a du Pont family heir who raped his young daughter has led to threats against her and calls for her removal from the bench.      But allies in the legal community have rallied to her defense.      Much of the outrage over Jurden's 2009 sentencing of Robert H. Richards IV for fourth-degree rape was over her notation that he would not \\"fare well'' in prison, a mitigating factor that she identified in her order.      Delaware prosecutors and defense attorneys have said it is unusual for a judge to list someone's fitness for prison as a mitigator in a sentencing order, even though it is often argued that a frail or sickly defendant might get abused or suffer unduly in prison.      Richards is the great-grandson of du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont and the son of Robert H. Richards III, a retired partner in the Richards Layton & Finger law firm.      Story: Beau Biden defends handling of du Pont heir sex case      Commentary: Beau Biden's letter on du Pont heir case      Commentary: Take into account entire sentencing process      Our view: Real questions about the Richards case      Earlier story: Police investigated du Pont sex abuse claim      Earlier story: Du Pont heir faces child sex lawsuit      His case gained publicity last month when his ex-wife, Tracy, filed a lawsuit seeking damages for the rape of his daughter when she was three years old, and also claimed he sexually abused his toddler son.      Police investigated claims about the son in 2010, but they said no charges were filed. Authorities said they will investigate the allegations in the lawsuit.      The controversy surrounding Jurden erupted after a Sunday News Journal article about her sentence. She sentenced Richards to eight years in prison, but suspended the time behind bars for probation. Among other provisions, she ordered him to get sex offender's evaluation and treatment, and not to have contact with children under 16.      Attorney General Beau Biden's office, which had originally charged him with two counts of second-degree rape punishable by a minimum prison term of 20 years, had given Richards the plea deal to fourth-degree rape and recommended probation.      The story gained international attention, leading to at least three online petitions for Jurden's ouster.      Emily Logan, director of activism and retention for www.Care2.com, said the site allows people across the globe to post petitions on a range of issues. One seeking Jurden's ouster has received more than 25,400 online signatures through Wednesday afternoon.      \\"It's pretty crazy. It's our hottest petition right now,'' said Logan, who added that her group supports the petition.      \\"Sexual assault and child abuse is something people are very passionate about,'' Logan said. \\"This petition focuses on the fact that this was a du Pont heir and it's a sort of 'money talks' situation where they were like, 'Oh, he has a bunch of money and we'll let him sit in his house.' The initial outrage is that suspending the sentence and that treatment should come first rather than prison wasn't proper punishment.''      While some want Jurden off the bench, others have threatened her, leading the state to provide her with security, said Patricia W. Griffin, state court administrator. \\"It's an ongoing investigation. We are taking the threats seriously, and making sure the judge is secured,'' Griffin said.      Robert H. Richards IV, a du Pont family heir who raped his 3-year-old daughter nearly a decade ago but received no prison time now faces a lawsuit from his former wife that accuses him of sexually abusing his toddler son. (3/18/14)      Jurden, who was appointed to a 12-year-term in 2001 and reappointed by Gov. Jack Markell last year, also applied to become a Supreme Court justice. Markell gave the seat to former Court of Chancery chief judge Leo E. Strine Jr. last month. Markell will have another appointment following the recent retirement announcement by Justice Jack Jacobs.      Some in Delaware's legal community rushed to Jurden's defense.      Bartholomew J. Dalton, former chief deputy attorney general and head of the sex crimes unit, reiterated a point others have made about the difficulty in proving child sex abuse cases involving relatives. Those cases can lead to plea bargains and probation for defendants, he said. Such deals don't make prosecutors happy, but can result in a felony conviction and listing the criminal on the state sex offenders registry, he said.      \\"As someone who has prosecuted sexual abuse and continues to represent child sexual abuse victims, I can tell you there are few, if any, judges who I think would do as good a job as Jan Jurden on an everyday basis,'' Dalton said. \\"Now she's getting death threats because of her administration of justice when she was absolutely within sentencing guidelines and was following the recommendation of the the prosecutor. It's just incredibly unfair.''      Biden's office has not said why the deal was cut, and a redacted version of the court file does not offer details. But top aides to Biden have said it's extremely difficult to put a young child on the witness stand, where they would face cross-examination and further victimization.      Richards' attorney, Eguene J. Maurer Jr., said Wednesday the state had no physical evidence to corroborate the claims of the child, and offered a deal that did not include mandatory prison time. While he argued at sentencing that Richards should receive probation and inpatient treatment, Maurer said he was concerned that Jurden might send his client to prison.      \\"I can think of one case of vehicular homicide involving a young girl. I thought we were going to get three years and she gave nine years. She is tough on our side and tough on their side. She is intelligent, reasonable. You are not going to get a better judge.''      Former Superior Court Judge Peggy Ableman said prosecutors were likely hamstrung in the Richards case because the victim was so young . \\"A child is going to be absolutely the worst witness,'' Ableman said. \\"You have no idea what they are going to say or not say.''      Ableman said she did not know why Jurden noted the factor in her order that Richards would not \\"fare well'' in prison, but said her decision to sentence him to probation makes sense. While judges have the authority to levy sentences within statutory guidelines, they are urged to follow more lenient guidelines published by the Delaware Sentencing Accountability Commission, a group of judges and top state criminal justice officials.      For the crime of fourth-degree rape, the recommended sentence is zero to 30 months in prison.      \\"If you are routinely not following what the state recommends, then the defense attorney cannot say to their client, 'I think you should take this deal because the judge will probably do what the state recommends.' If the judge is going to be a loose cannon, you are not going to get pleas.''      Regardless of Jurden's decision in the Richards' case, Ableman said she is a credit to the bench. \\"She doesn't deserve to be painted in such an awful way. She is a very caring person and she is very concerned about children and children's rights.\\"      Contact senior reporter Cris Barrish at (302) 324-2785, cbarrish@delawareonline.com or on Facebook.

Biden and his team had prosecuted. The case involved a young child who had been sexually abused by a parent, and the office had faced the difficult task of deciding whether to take the case to trial or resolve it through a negotiated plea. The decision was complicated by the fact that the only evidence in the case was the child's word against that of the alleged perpetrator, and the difficulties that can arise when trying to put a young child on the witness stand. In the end, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea agreement that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered rehabilitation therapy, and have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of 16. The judge who sentenced the defendant took into account the Truth in Sentencing Guidelines and various mitigating factors, such as the defendant's acceptance of responsibility and his agreement to the recommended sentence. The judge ultimately imposed a sentence that placed the defendant under supervision for a lengthy period of time, required him to complete counseling, placed him on the sex offender registry, and prevented him from contacting the victim and any other child.

Ok , so the panic hit me I yelled out I am going to drown if you do n't get over here . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What might happen if no one helps the writer and child ?","output":"In the passage, the writer explicitly states their struggle and fear while swimming with the extra weight of their three-year-old son. They are experiencing fatigue and the desperate need for help. If no one comes to their aid, the following scenarios are highly probable: 1. Drowning: The writer repeatedly emphasizes their fear of drowning if they don't receive assistance. They state, \\"if you don't get over here, I am going to drown.\\" Moreover, they mention the panic setting in, making the situation even more perilous. Therefore, it is deducible that not getting help could lead to the tragic outcome of both the writer and their child drowning. 2. Exhaustion: The writer alludes to their weariness and the strain that comes with struggling to swim while carrying a child. An inability to find help will likely exacerbate the writer's exhaustion, putting both of them in a vulnerable situation and increasing the risk of drowning. 3. Emotional distress: Since the writer is yelling for help with increasing strength and passion, it is evident that they feel desperate and emotionally distressed. The absence of timely help will further amplify and prolong this emotional turmoil, which could have lasting effects on both the writer and the child. 4. Hypothermia: The passage doesn't provide specific details about the temperature and location; however, if this ordeal occurs in cold water, the writer and the child might be at risk of developing hypothermia. The longer they remain in the water without aid, the greater the likelihood of experiencing the dangerous effects of cold exposure. In conclusion, without help, the writer and child face possible drowning, exhaustion, emotional distress, and even hypothermia. This highlights the urgency in the writer's plea for assistance and the potential dire consequences should they not receive it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dedicated and passionate about her work, she embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets behind the myths and legends of the ancient Greek world. During an excavation, Georgia discovers an ancient manuscript that has remained hidden for millennia. The text, written in an archaic form of ancient Greek, tells the story of lost spirits that once roamed the earth and held great powers that influenced fate and time. Intrigued by the findings, Georgia becomes obsessed with deciphering the text and understanding its implications. With the help of her brilliant yet eccentric assistant, Milo, she uncovers the story of three ancient spirits: Aletheia, the spirit of truth; Hemera, the spirit of time; and Aion, the spirit of eternity. According to the manuscript, the powerful spirits had been dormant for centuries but are waiting to be awakened. As Georgia uncovers more secrets hidden within the manuscript, she crosses paths with an ambitious but ruthless archaeologist, Thomas Sinclair, who is consumed by his desire to possess the powers of the ancient spirits. Sinclair believes that by waking the spirits, he can control fate and amass great power over the modern world. Georgia and Milo discover that the spirits can be awakened through specific rituals and relics dating back to Classic Greece. The duo sets out on a race against time to locate these relics, all the while being pursued by Sinclair and his henchmen. During their journey, they visit historic sites, crack ancient codes, and uncover hidden treasures in an effort to save the world from Sinclair's devastating ambition. In a thrilling climax, Georgia and Milo face Sinclair at the Temple of Athena, where the spirits are to be awakened. A fierce battle ensues, but ultimately Georgia and Milo defeat the villain. The ancient spirits, grateful for Georgia's reverence and dedication to preserving their legacy, bestow unique gifts upon her and Milo. Aletheia grants Georgia the wisdom to discern truth from lies, Hemera gives Milo the ability to perceive significant moments in time, and Aion grants them both the gift of a long, fulfilling life. The film ends with the secrets of the ancient spirits preserved, and Georgia and Milo using their newfound gifts to continue unraveling the mysteries of Classic Greece.

I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.  Now, I have a new situation: People from two villages ate lots of salt. People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists.  Answer this question please: Which village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties? Answer:","output":"The Sand village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties. Step 1: Understand the background information. In the given background, it is mentioned that before iodized salt was developed, people experienced developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. Adding iodide anion to the diet helped treat these conditions. Step 2: Analyze the new situation. In the new situation, people from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village used iodized salt in their diets after talking to specialists. Step 3: Apply the background information to the new situation. Since iodized salt contains iodide anion, which is beneficial in preventing developmental difficulties, people consuming iodized salt, i.e., the residents of Sand village, are more likely to have fewer developmental issues when compared to the residents of Salt village, who used regular salt that lacks the iodide anion.

Most people have moved to a few \\"mega\\" cities, where, due to the rampant population increase, law and order have collapsed.

Fergee finds himself an unwitting accomplice, passing ammunition to the block warriors.Street Judges Hershey and her candidate judge respond to the block war. Hershey calls immediately for backup, which arrives in the form of Judge Joseph Dredd, the most famous of all the Street Judges. He leads an assault on the block warriors, dispatching several of them rapidly with his pistol, the Lawgiver 2. Hershey's candidate is killed when he rushes into the command post and is shot immediately. Dredd kills everyone but the block war leader and charges him with several violations of the Mega City Municipal Code, before summarily executing him for the candidate's murder. He announces that court is adjourned. Outside the apartment, he finds Fergee hiding in a servo-droid and finds him guilty as a repeat offender, giving him five more years in Aspen.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria? ?  Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization. Answer:","output":"The kingdom that maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power, and economic prosperity with Makuria was Alodia, also known as Alwa. Alodia was a medieval Nubian kingdom located in what is now central and southern Sudan, with its capital in Soba.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years . Heyman Steinthal in an 1880 article in Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie noted a variant he heard sung by a housemaid , Die Kugel kam geflogen / Gilt sie mir ? Gilt sie dir ?

Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss.  - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\".  - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.   - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787  13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.    What is the relationship between 'ich hatt' einen kameraden' and 'poem'? A:","output":"\\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces, also known as \\"The good Comrade.\\" The text of this lament was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809, making it a poem. Thus, the relationship between \\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" and \\"poem\\" is that \\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" is a poem written by Ludwig Uhland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

He takes pictures of the men with his phone, sends the pictures, and then throws the phone into a burning garbage can. Hauser is then seen on a plane getting directions and life advice from the on-board navigation system, Jerry (Montel Williams). He turns on his screen to receive a video call from the former Vice President (Dan Aykroyd) who gives him his next mission: to terminate Omar Sharif (Lyubomir Neikov), the CEO of the oil company Ugigas in Ugigistan. He tells Hauser that he will be working under the Viceroy, whose identity is still being withheld until further notice. He also tells Hauser that his cover will be a trade show host, working with Tamerlane, a huge corporation that specializes in advertising. He must produce a trade show and a gala wedding as a finale, and still manage to kill Omar Sharif before he makes his plane back to Ugigistan. He is taken by a car to the safe Emerald City within the fictional war-torn desert country of Turaqistan. In the Tamerlane building, he meets Marsha (Joan Cusack), his assistant for the mission. Once inside the building, he notices a reporter, Natalie Hegalhuzen (Marisa Tomei) attempting unsuccessfully to get inside the Tamerlane building. Natalie attempts to find out why she can't get into Tamerlane, and after asking him several questions, is rushed out of the room by Hauser who doesn't want to reveal any personal details about himself.

He says that \\"cross-pollination increases genetic diversity\\" and \\"evolution requires genetic diversity\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"The question in the quiz states, \\"Cross-pollination increases something required by what?\\" Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can deduce the best possible answer to the question. The first hint given is that \\"cross-pollination increases genetic diversity.\\" Cross-pollination is the process whereby pollen from one plant is transferred to the stigma of another plant, which subsequently promotes the fertilization process, leading to seed production in flowering plants. This interchange of genes between different plants increases the genetic diversity among the offspring. Genetic diversity is important because it enables a species to adapt and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. The second hint provided suggests that \\"evolution requires genetic diversity.\\" Evolution refers to the gradual change in species over time due to genetic variations and natural selection. Genetic diversity serves as the foundation for evolution, as it introduces new traits and characteristics to a species. Including a larger variety of genes enhances a species' ability to survive, adapt, and evolve in response to its environment. Higher genetic diversity results in a higher likelihood of advantageous traits emerging in a population, which has a higher chance of being passed down to future generations. Considering the two hints, one can infer that cross-pollination increases the genetic diversity in plant populations, which is a prerequisite for evolution. Therefore, the best answer to the question \\"Cross-pollination increases something required by what?\\" is \\"evolution.\\" In summary, cross-pollination enhances genetic diversity, which is vital for the process of evolution to occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Determined to take a new path and create his own legacy, Matt decides to pursue his passion for music. He joins East Great Falls High School's struggling band, much to the chagrin of the school's popular kids and his fellow band members, who aren't thrilled about having a Stifler in their midst. Matt's initial goal is to use the band to win the heart of his crush, Allison, the school's talented and enigmatic band lead vocalist. As the band practices for the prestigious National High School Band Competition, they face numerous obstacles. Matt's partying lifestyle clashes with the discipline needed for their rigorous rehearsals, and his past antics haunt the band’s reputation. A rival school band, led by the snobbish and intimidating Brandon, is hellbent on crushing them in the upcoming competition. The band not only have to face external challenges but also have to navigate their own internal issues, such as jealousy, clashing egos, and creative differences. Throughout the movie, a series of flashbacks and anecdotes reveal that Steve, unbeknown to his younger brother, was a talented musician in high school who opted for a wild lifestyle instead of pursuing this passion. This revelation adds depth to Matt's resolve and determination to make it as a musician. As the plot thickens, Matt begins to evolve as a character, gradually becoming more responsible, dedicated, and supportive.

Article: The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus, and against the protests of the senate, removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals. Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire: in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors. Ambrose, the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus's request for tolerance. Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms.[clarification needed] He was the last emperor of both East and West.

DOS is a family of disk operating systems primarily consisting of MS-DOS and a rebranded version under the name IBM PC DOS which were introduced in 1981, as well as some later compatible systems from other manufacturers: DR-DOS (1988), ROM-DOS (1989), PTS-DOS (1993), and FreeDOS (1998). MS-DOS dominated the x86-based IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.  Dozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \\"DOS\\", including the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966. Others are Apple DOS, Apple ProDOS, Atari DOS, Commodore DOS, TRSDOS, and AmigaDOS.  IBM PC DOS (and the separately sold MS-DOS) and its predecessor, 86-DOS, resembled Digital Research's CP/M—the dominant disk operating system for 8-bit Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 based microcomputers. DOS instead ran on Intel 8086 16-bit processors. Starting with MS-DOS 1.28 and PC DOS 2.0 the operating system incorporated various features inspired by Xenix, Microsoft's variant of Unix.  When IBM introduced the IBM PC, built with the Intel 8088 microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO Bill Gates (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard, which allowed CP/M to run on an Apple II). IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \\"PC DOS\\".

Familiar faces: Some are predicting Hilary Clinton to be the","output":"Democratic candidate once again Indeed, the very mention of familiar, influential names like Bush and Clinton throws the political landscape into absolute anticipatory intrigue.  Former President George W. Bush has clearly stated his viewpoint on whom he would prefer to see vying for the highest office in the country. In an unexpected reveal, he voiced his support for his brother, Jeb Bush. Jeb, having previously served as the Governor of Florida, has a political background that is well-regarded by many in the Republican party. With this backing, he stands as a potentially strong contender for the 2016 candidacy. This support, together with his reputation and popularity among Hispanic voters, is likely to significantly swing the minority vote in the Republicans' favour, potentially shifting the election to the conservatives' advantage. However, Jeb Bush's participation in the 2016 race is yet to be confirmed. Despite the eager support from his brother and numerous other Republicans, the former Governor has refrained from announcing a firm decision. The suspense adds another layer to the political intrigue building around the prospective 2016 race.  And as the Republicans rally around Jeb Bush, murmurs across the aisle suggest that the Democrats may rely on a tried-and-tested candidate. Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and First Lady, is considered by many to be the Democrats' most potent weapon. Her experience, tenacity, and extensive network within the party and beyond make her a likely frontrunner for the Democratic candidacy.  However, just like Jeb Bush, Clinton is yet to declare her intentions for 2016. Her potential candidacy has Democrats excited and hopeful, as a Clinton vs. Bush match could result in a gripping battle reminiscent of past elections. The political forecast for 2016 thus paints an uncertain, yet highly intriguing, picture. The atmospheres in both parties indicate a mix of anticipation and suspense. The world is watching, waiting eagerly for contenders to step up and champions to be declared. The upcoming 2016 Presidential race promises to be a true political tour de force. The contest of Bush Vs. Clinton AGAIN could make this election a historic battle, reflecting the cyclical nature of politics and power. The stage is set, the actors yet undecided; only the passage of time will clue us in on the thrilling spectacle that the 2016 U.S Presidential election is poised to become."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You will be given a sentence.

After the first date, there are several things you can do to impress a girl: A) Maintain communication: After the first date, make sure to keep in touch with her. Let her know that you enjoyed the date, and if you feel it went well, express your interest in having a follow-up date. B) Be thoughtful: If she mentioned something on the date that she likes or is interested in, consider sending her a related text, article, or meme that aligns with her interests. This shows that you were paying attention and are thoughtful. C) Plan a second date: If the first date was a success and you'd like to see her again, plan a memorable second date that takes her preferences into account. This might include trying a new activity together, visiting a unique location, or attending an event that you know she will enjoy. D) Be genuine: It's essential to be yourself and not try too hard to impress. People can sense when someone is being inauthentic. Express your true feelings and emotions to create a real connection.

How do I impress a girl on the first date? To impress a girl on the first date, consider the following tips: A) Plan: Make an effort to plan the date thoughtfully, taking her likes and dislikes into consideration. Coordinate the location, time, and type of date that will set a comfortable atmosphere and allow for meaningful connection. B) Dress appropriately: Dress up for the date to show that you respect the occasion and her company. First impressions matter, and dressing well will give her a positive idea of who you are. C) Be punctual: Arriving on time shows respect for her time and signals that the date is important to you. If something unexpected happens and you might be late, make sure to inform her beforehand. D) Confidence and body language: Project confidence through your body language, such as maintaining eye contact, standing tall, and putting your phone away. This can make her feel more comfortable and help the conversation to flow naturally. E) Be interested: Focus your attention on getting to know her instead of merely talking about yourself. Show genuine interest in her life, work, hobbies, and experiences. Ask open-ended questions that encourage conversation. F) Be a gentleman: Treat her with respect, show common courtesy, and engage in polite conversation. Open doors, pull out her chair, and offer to pay for the date. G) Be present: Pay attention to the conversation, maintain eye contact, and listen actively to what she has to say. Avoid distractions such as checking your phone or other interruptions. H) Be authentic: Be genuine and express your true feelings, opinions, and beliefs. Authenticity is key to impressing a girl and forming a real connection. While these are two separate questions, both of them focus on impressing a girl in the context of dating.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy in 1916 and continued there until his death? from the following article ?  Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the...

A young boy with psychiatric problems is locked in a cage every day to stop him destroying things and beating up his sister while his father goes out to work. Xiao Wang, 12 years old, was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Cortical Dysplasia - a congenital abnormality which causes seizures. His single father, Zhong Kefu, 45, began locking him up after becoming worried by his violent behaviour,following complaints from neighbours. Xiao Wang, 12,  is locked in a 2 square metre (21 square feet) cage every day to protect his neighbours and sister from his violent outbursts. His father,  Zhong Kefu, 45 (centre) says he has to keep his son in the cage so he can go out to work to pay for food, and for medical treatment. Xiao has destroyed neighbours' property before, including smashing up an old lady's cooking pot, and is violent towards his six-year-old sister (left) In the past his son has taken neighbours' cloths, shoes and cell phones and thrown them in the village paddy fields, and smashed an old lady's cooking pot, That's magazine reports. For months now, Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside. Mr Zhong says he must keep his son in a cage so he can go out to work and earn enough money to pay for his treatment. Mr Zhong said: 'When he was younger he ate anything he picked up, whether it was edible or not. 'Then he started destroying things, smashing them to pieces. 'Neighbours started getting angry because he was destroying their property and being violent with other children. 'He was also breaking things at home.' Mr Zhong' s wife, who was mentally disabled, gave birth to Xiao  in 2002. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It can occur in people of any intellectual ability but many people with ADHD also have learning difficulties. Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable as a child grows up. Many children with ADHD also must have conduct disorder –  involving a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals. In half of children, there is also a tendency towards oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – which is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers. Studies have shown children with ADHD have 25 times the risk of being institutionalised for delinquency and nine times the risk of being sent to prison. His parents noticed he behaved different from other children of the same age, and his only words were 'dad' or 'baba', and as he grew his behaviour became increasingly challenging. He became violent with other children, including his sister, who is now six years old. Mr Zhong and his wife were only allowed to have a second child – something normally forbidden under the Chinese government's one-child policy – because of Xiao's condition. At first, Mr Zhong tied his son up and left him while he went to work in the village of Taoshu in Xiushui county in southern China's Jiangxi province. But when he got home he always found Xiao's wrists were red raw from struggling to get free. He tried locking him in his bedroom, but Xiao smashed the window one night and escaped, causing damage in the local neighborhood. Mr Zhong said: 'I would like him to be able to go to school, to get an education and play with other children. 'But no school will accept him. He has a six-year-old sister, but is always violent with her as well. 'I need to make money to support my family and to get him treatment. 'But the only thing I can do at the moment is keep him in the cage until I have raised enough.' For months now Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside. Mr Zhong is far from proud of his solution, according to That's magazine. 'I can't bear to treat him this way but the schools won't take him, and if I don't go out and work we'll starve,' it reported. A spokesman from the Jiangxi Children's Hospital where Xiao was diagnosed said: 'Unless he gets proper therapy soon he will stay this way for life.' Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside.

The 76-year-old comedian is slated to play the patriarch of a multigenerational family, NBC told CNN on Wednesday. Bill Cosby to return to NBC in new sitcom. A network representative did not elaborate on anything else involving the show. No doubt, NBC is hoping this version of Cos brings back memories of his eight-year run as the gruff but warmhearted Dr. Cliff Huxtable on \\"The Cosby Show\\" -- and not the failed gumshoe of \\"The Cosby Mysteries,\\" which lasted one season in 1994-95, or the cranky retiree of \\"Cosby\\" (1996-2000), which started out strong but sank quickly in the ratings. The return of Cosby coincides with other figures from the '80s and early '90s making their return to prime time in one way or another. Michael J. Fox has been heading a clan on \\"The Michael J. Fox Show\\" since September, and Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos are reuniting for a yogurt commercial to air during the Super Bowl. (No word on whether the Olsen twins will be in tow.) \\"Full House\\" stars reunite for Super Bowl. But nostalgia and Q scores -- those popularity measuring sticks marketers love so much -- only go so far. Sure, Cosby is a popular guy. People still have warm feelings about the comedian, even if it's been ages since he was TV's most popular pitchman. (Don't laugh -- the man's in the Advertising Hall of Fame.) And \\"The Cosby Show\\" was a landmark in TV sitcoms, not only showcasing a bright African-American family but leading the ratings for five straight years in the 1980s. NBC began more than a decade of dominance thanks to \\"Cosby's\\" success. \\"Bill Cosby is always going to be welcomed into people's homes because of nostalgia for the Huxtables,\\" says Amanda McClain, a communications professor at Holy Family University in Philadelphia. The trick, however, is the show he'll be placed in. \\"A famous name is itself no guarantee,\\" wrote Time's James Poniewozik, observing that Fox's show has suffered because it's depended too heavily on memories of the lead instead of making his show interesting. \\"Bill Cosby, like the Jell-O he once pitched, remains a beloved brand. But if his show makes it to air, the proof will be not in the brand but in the pudding.\\" 'Television isn't very reflective of reality' So what might a new Cosby sitcom look like? Probably something like America -- whatever that is these days. After all, TV families have always reflected our culture, even if they've sometimes been a year or two behind the times. In the 1950s, \\"Father Knows Best\\" showed off a happy nuclear family in Springfield, USA. In the 1960s, \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\" offered a Kennedyesque household in suburban New York. The 1970s included \\"The Brady Bunch,\\" about a blended clan for a time in which divorce and second marriages were becoming commonplace. (However, divorce was still stigmatized enough that it was never revealed whether Carol Brady was a widow or a divorcee.) In the wake of \\"All in the Family\\" and producer Norman Lear's other edgy shows, 1970s TV families took on the broader appearance of society. \\"Good Times\\" was set in a Chicago housing project; \\"One Day at a Time\\" featured a single-mother household in Indianapolis. But TV is also nothing if not aspirational, says McClain, and Lear's unflinching sitcoms -- exceptional even in their time -- were swept aside in the 1980s. \\"Television isn't very reflective of reality,\\" she says. \\"There's underrepresentation of people of color, underrepresentation of many different types of people. Still today, there are very few Asian-American or Latino people on television.\\" Even \\"The Cosby Show,\\" with its upper-class doctor and lawyer living in Brooklyn Heights, was often more aspirational than realistic, she says. Viewers, however, apparently like aspirational. Since the '80s, the dominant family shows have been \\"The Cosby Show\\" and \\"Family Ties,\\" \\"Home Improvement\\" and \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" \\"Two and a Half Men\\" and \\"Modern Family.\\" Some have unusual family structures -- \\"Modern Family,\\" famously, includes a gay couple, an old-young husband-wife combination and several stepchildren -- but they generally feature white clans and take place in well-off circumstances. Though there have been several sitcoms featuring people of color or folks in working-class circumstances, about the only breakout exception has been \\"Roseanne,\\" Roseanne Barr's early '90s hit, which regularly reflected genuine working-class circumstances. \\"Compared to like the '70s, where you had true diversity -- 'Sanford & Son' and 'Good Times,' people of all walks of life, jobs and bank accounts -- today it's as if we've regressed in some ways,\\" says John Griffiths, president of the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association and TV critic for Us Weekly. He suggests one reason might be because Hollywood is somewhat insular. \\"The networks try really hard at having diverse sitcom writing staffs, but there's still an issue with a lot of white guys who maybe went to Harvard and live on the west side of L.A. who write these shows,\\" he says. Next step: Senior citizens? There have been some attempts to change the view on broadcast television, he points out, though new styles have struggled to catch on. \\"The New Normal,\\" which featured a same-sex couple and their relationship with a surrogate and her family, was canceled after one season; \\"The Middle,\\" about a middle-class family in Indiana, has plodded along, \\"underrated,\\" in Griffiths' opinion. Cable television, which has the luxury of targeting its \\"reality\\" shows -- many of which are simply sitcoms in different guise -- at specific demographics, has opted for upscale families (\\"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\\"), heartland groups (\\"Duck Dynasty\\") or a mix of flavors (\\"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\\"). Families come in many forms on television, of course -- what was \\"Friends\\" if not about a family of sorts? -- and the next wave may include more senior citizens. With baby boomers starting to take care of aging parents and being called \\"the sandwich generation,\\" a Cosby show truly reflecting issues across generations could be a hit, says McClain, the communications professor. Or perhaps a new Cosby show could simply focus on the elderly, Griffiths says. \\"The aged are very underrepresented,\\" he says. He observes that his group's pick for unsung TV show of the year, HBO's \\"Getting On,\\" is set in an extended-care unit and includes a closeted homosexual, an African-American nurse and a variety of senior citizens. (HBO is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) \\"It's almost like a Norman Lear show,\\" Griffiths says. A Cosby show need not go that far -- it'll be on NBC, not HBO, after all -- but the lead could make of it what he wants. \\"The great thing is that Cosby is at an age where he'll be playing a grandfather,\\" Griffiths says. All you need is one successful show to start a trend, and if a wider range of ages is shown on a TV show, it could lead to others. After all, the ultimate family show -- even in these days of DVRs and second screens -- is watching TV, McClain says. \\"Television is a family event,\\" she says. \\"Families watch television together.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article discusses the announcement of Bill Cosby starring in a new sitcom on NBC, playing the patriarch of a multigenerational family. The network hopes that the return of Cosby will bring back memories of his successful run on \\"The Cosby Show\\" rather than his less successful ventures in the 1990s. The article also examines the changing landscape of family sitcoms in television history, from \\"Father Knows Best\\" in the 1950s to \\"Modern Family\\" today. It also addresses the potential for further inclusion of senior citizens in television shows and how that may be relevant to the upcoming Cosby show."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

You are given a new situation: Two farmers provide a neighboring city with plenty of produce every year. Brick farm has a lot of plant problems, their plants experience abiotic stress. Boulder farm had a good production because their plants presented almost no signs of abiotic stress.  and a hint : A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...  Please answer this question : Which farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water? A:","output":"Brick farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water. The reason for this is that Brick farm has a lot of plant problems and experiences abiotic stress. One of the primary responses to abiotic stress, such as high salinity, is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the plant cell's cytoplasm. High concentrations of Na+ can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Since Boulder farm had good production and their plants presented almost no signs of abiotic stress, it is less likely that their plants face issues in taking up water compared to Brick farm."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

At that time, there were two kinds of companies. First, there were traditional companies which sold things in stores. Then, there were Internet companies which didn't have stores, they sold things only over the Net. Traditional companies didn't want to lose any business. Quickly, they created their own websites and began selling things over the Net. These are the so-called \\"brick and click\\" companies. Many stores are made of brick, and you click on your mouse to buy things with your computer. That's where the name \\"brick and click\\" comes from. By the late 1990s, e-businesses like Amazon.com, Buy.com, and eToys.com were in trouble. Their profits  were not very high, and there was a lot of competition. Many of these businesses lost a lot of money, and in 2000, many e-businesses were out of business. In the world of e-commerce , companies are fighting for every dollar and every customer. Will brick and click companies win the war? Only time will tell. Question: Why were Internet companies in a lot of trouble in the late 1990s? Answer: A:","output":"(1). Competition was heavy. In the late 1990s, Internet companies found themselves in a lot of trouble mainly due to the heavy competition they faced. As traditional companies, which already had established customer bases, started to create their own websites and sell their products online, they became \\"brick and click\\" companies. These new competitors had the advantage of already being well-known, with established brands and a physical presence. This meant that the Internet companies had to fight harder to gain market share and make a name for themselves, as they were competing against established businesses that were quickly adapting to the online world. With so many companies entering the e-commerce space, there was significant pressure on the Internet companies to differentiate themselves and attract more customers. On top of the competition from brick and click companies, Internet companies also faced competition amongst themselves, as many new e-businesses were emerging on the scene. This led to an oversaturated market, making it difficult for individual companies to stand out and prosper. Low profits further exacerbated the situation for Internet companies, as they struggled to generate sustainable revenue. This financial instability made it challenging for many of these companies to continue operating, and by 2000, several e-businesses found themselves out of business. Thus, the main reason why Internet companies were in a lot of trouble in the late 1990s was the heavy competition they encountered, both from traditional businesses adapting to the online world and from the numerous other e-businesses trying to make a name for themselves in an increasingly crowded market."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this). I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice. I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (Mononoke). At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one. In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro. Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it. It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist. Despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact. If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene.

Write a text based on \\"in law school obama entered political arena\\" Text:","output":"Title: From Law School to the Political Arena: Barack Obama's Journey Barack Obama's entry into politics can be traced back to his days in law school. Graduating from Harvard Law School in 1991, it was here that he began to display signs of his impressive leadership qualities, eventually forging a successful career in the political arena. In this text, we will explore Obama's formative years, his accomplishments in law school, and how this experience laid the groundwork for his political ascent. Step 1: Establishing Obama's law school background Before Barack Obama entered law school, he had already demonstrated a passion for social justice and helping others. Having worked as a community organizer in Chicago, Obama decided to pursue a legal education at Harvard Law School, one of the most prestigious in the United States. Step 2: Leadership in the Law School It was during his time at Harvard Law School that Obama's political potential began to emerge. As a promising student, he quickly gained the respect of his fellow classmates and professors. In 1990, he was elected as the first African-American president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review. Under his tenure, Obama took on the overwhelming task of overseeing the publication, managing a student staff of 80 people and negotiating contentious debates on various legal issues. Step 3: Commitment to social justice Throughout his time at law school, Obama remained committed to social justice and public service. His approach to legal education went beyond the classroom, as he continued his involvement in community organizing. He also volunteered at legal clinics, helping underprivileged communities gain access to legal representation and understand their rights. Step 4: Laying the groundwork for his political career Obama's time at law school provided him with crucial skills that would later help him excel in the political arena. Developing his negotiation and consensus-building abilities while managing the Harvard Law Review, he proved himself as a leader who could bridge gaps between different parties. This experience would later translate into his campaigning style and his approach to governing once he entered the world of politics. Step 5: Transitioning to politics Following his graduation from law school, Barack Obama returned to Chicago to begin his political career. In 1996, he was elected to the Illinois State Senate, where he continued to focus on social justice and community empowerment. This early political success laid the foundation for his subsequent rise to the United States Senate and, ultimately, the presidency in 2008. In conclusion, Barack Obama's experience in law school marked a pivotal point in his life, setting the stage for his entrance into the political arena. It was during these formative years that he honed his leadership skills, commitment to social justice, and ability to navigate complex debates. As such, Obama's time at Harvard Law School not only prepared him for a successful legal career but also played a significant role in shaping the future leader of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Devolution in Northern Ireland has been on hold since the collapse of the executive in January. Talks are due to continue over the summer months after parties failed to reach a power-sharing agreement before the parliamentary recess. \\"We're sitting in a situation where the can has been kicked down the road to the autumn,\\" said Ms Mallon. The North Belfast representative said MLAs were not fulfilling their duties as elected officials, and so their pay should be altered accordingly. \\"We are doing our constituency work but we are not performing our legislative role - we're not in our committees scrutinising legislation or taking evidence. A former member of the Independent Financial Review Panel which sets MLAs' salaries has called for their pay to be stopped entirely until a deal was reached - as it was wasting £1m of taxpayers' money each month. \\"Let's get real about it - they are not even going to go back to talks until September, October,\\" said former PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan McQuillan. \\"We've basically got a blank cheque for the next six months and this is at a time when people in the public sector, third sector will be losing their jobs,\\" Mr McQuillan told the Nolan Show. Northern Ireland's civil servants have been in control of finances for several months as a result of the ongoing deadlock. As uncertainty over future finances continues, the government programme Sure Start has announced that 50 jobs in its South Belfast branch were in \\"jeopardy due to a lack of decisions on the Northern Ireland budget\\". Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire suggested this week he was considering passing a budget from Westminster. To date, civil servants have only had 75% of the block grant allocation, but a budget bill would give them access to all £10bn of Northern Ireland's annual day-to-day spending funds. This would also split the cash among individual departments like health and education, says BBC News NI Business Correspondent Julian O'Neill. But it would still leave the question of who decides what polices or projects to spend it on, which are political decisions for ministers, not civil servants, adds our correspondent. On Tuesday DUP leader Arlene Foster said the question of pay for MLAs \\"would be relevant if we weren't doing any work\\". \\"I've indicated very clearly that we intend to continue the negotiations... over the coming months,\\" said the former first minister. \\"People will be off on holidays from time to time, but I think what you're hearing from myself and the DUP is a commitment to continue to do the work as we want to find an accommodation everyone can buy in to.\\" The most significant sticking points between the DUP and Northern Ireland's second largest party, Sinn Féin, remain an Irish language act, same-sex marriage, a Bill of Rights and measures to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles. In January, the late Martin McGuinness, of Sinn Féin, resigned in protest over the DUP's handling of an inquiry into a botched green energy scheme. His party had demanded that DUP leader Arlene Foster step aside temporarily to allow an investigation into the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme - which she set up - but Mrs Foster refused. Over the past six months, and during two elections at Stormont and Westminster, the two parties have remained deadlocked over a number of issues. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the issue of salaries for Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in Northern Ireland amid the lack of progress in forming a new power-sharing government. This situation has led to civil servants managing finances for several months. Some are arguing that MLAs should not receive their salaries while the legislative role is unfulfilled. Devolution in Northern Ireland has been placed on hold since January, when the power-sharing executive collapsed. A former member of the Independent Financial Review Panel, which sets MLAs' salaries, has proposed that the pay should be stopped completely until an agreement is reached, as it is wasting £1 million of taxpayers' money per month. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has suggested that he may pass a budget from Westminster to help deal with the uncertainty over future finances.

Paragraph: As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

Input: Passage: To differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the early 1980s' common perception of a troubled and shallow video game market, the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning, and it established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall system was referred to as an \\"Entertainment System\\" instead of a \\"video game system\\", which was centered upon a machine called a \\"Control Deck\\" instead of a \\"console\\", and which featured software cartridges called \\"Game Paks\\" instead of \\"video games\\". The 10NES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck, deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo's licensed approval. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game, which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own. Symbols on the launch games' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game, in order to reduce consumer confusion.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  Paragraph: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which uncle doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people? Answer:","output":"Uncle Sam is the uncle who does not take a drug that works slightly differently in many people. According to the provided information, Uncle Tom is on statin drugs, which are known to have varying effects on individuals depending on their genetic background and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These statin drugs help lower cholesterol levels in the blood and can work differently based on each person's genetic makeup. Uncle Sam, on the other hand, is not taking any statin drugs, and therefore, he is not experiencing the variations in drug response caused by genetic factors. Pharmacogenomics is a field that studies the relationship between an individual's genetics and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs, and it may help further understand why some people, like Uncle Tom, might experience more or less significant reductions in cholesterol levels when taking statin drugs compared to others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: It's football training, but not as we know it. German champions Borussia Dortmund are boldly going where no club has gone before with the \\"Footbonaut\\", a soccer training machine powered by a smart phone. Winners of the Bundesliga title in each of the last two seasons, Dortmund has unveiled the 14-meter cage which is the brainchild of Berlin-based designer Christian Guttler. Once inside the \\"Footbonaut\\", a player is fed balls by eight different machines, having to find one of the 72 panels - - lit by a flashing green light -- which make up the space-age contraption before receiving another ball. Dortmund hope the device, which can also be operated using a tablet, will improve a player's technique, spatial awareness and peripheral vision. Intensity. Not that Dortmund requires much improvement. Jurgen Klopp's team sits fourth in the German top flight and is being heavily tipped for European success after excelling in a Champions League group containing Real Madrid, Manchester City and Ajax, with the Spanish club's manager Jose Mourinho viewing them as candidates to win the tournament. Klopp has instilled in Dortmund a non-stop adventurous style of football and the \\"Footbonaut\\" is the next step in their pursuit of excellence. \\"It´s as if you are surrounded by 10 colleagues who are there only to serve you balls,\\" said Dortmund's Australian youngster Mustafa Amini after a session inside the cage. \\"In the course of normal training that level of intensity just is not possible. The ´Footbonaut´ allows you to work on any weaknesses and ensures that you play at pace but with precision.\\" Guttler claims that after 15 minutes in the cage a player \\"will have received and passed on as many balls as he would in a normal week of training. \\"Repetition and intensity are crucial if you want to conquer a particular skill, whether that be playing football, tennis or learning the piano.\\" Perfect tool. Dortmund's success in recent years and the performances of players like striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Mario Gotze have attracted admiring glances from a host of top clubs. Japan's Shinji Kagawa and Nurin Sahin of Turkey have both been developed by Dortmund in recent years before being sold on to Manchester United and Real Madrid respectively. Sahin is currently on loan at Liverpool. And former Mainz coach Klopp hopes the \\"Footbonaut\\" can help Dortmund maintain their stellar standards. \\"It is the perfect tool to improve ball-handling skills,\\" said the 45-year-old. \\"It demands precise skills used at speed in a physically tough environment. It´s quite a package!\\" Echoing Klopp's excitement, Dortmund's chief scout Sven Mislintat is interested by the cage's potential to analyze player development. \\"We can closely monitor a player´s development with data gleaned from the machine,\\" said Mislintat. \\"There is no reason why a player cannot translate the actions practised in this environment onto the actual playing field.\\" Caution. But Belgian coach Michel Bruyninckx, who works with the Aspire Academy in Qatar -- the gulf kingdom which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup -- struck a note of caution. \\"One of the major features of high performance is focused attention and that can be trained through this device,\\" Bruyninckx told CNN. \\"Brain research tells us that optimal learning requires that skill training must be embedded in the natural environment of an activity. This is not the case (with 'Footbonaut'). \\"The fact the player must react to a sound is not matching the reality of a game when a player reacts to visual information.\\" And Bruyninckx questioned the position of the player in the cage. \\"The fact the performing player always stays in the central position is also a disadvantage. In a game he has to move and search for the best position to receive the ball. \\"I am also curious to know how one-footed or technically less skilled players are going to react tn the 'Footbonaut'. For me you need to prepare a player for this kind of resource.\\" Bruyninckx also raised concerns over the grueling physical workout which the cage gives a player. \\"Using sweating as a parameter is not a good approach,\\" he said. \\"Too often coaches think that high intensity delivers high performance. Brain research tells us that if energy is low, learning will go down.\\" So, while the \\"Footbonaut\\" is one small step for Dortmund, it could take a giant leap for the device to become a fixture at training grounds across the world. Highlights:","output":"1. Borussia Dortmund introduces the \\"Footbonaut,\\" a smartphone-powered soccer training machine designed by Berlin-based Christian Guttler. 2. The 14-meter cage is equipped with eight ball-feeding machines and 72 panels that light up, to improve player technique, spatial awareness, and peripheral vision. 3.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose warm air rises from the ocean happens, how will it affect LESS snow.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of warm air rising from the ocean can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of snow formation, potentially leading to less snow. Direct effect: When warm air rises from the ocean, it meets colder air in the atmosphere. If the temperature difference between the warm air and the cold air is not significant enough for the water vapor to condense and form ice crystals, snow formation will be hindered. The water vapor may instead condense into water droplets, leading to rain or other forms of precipitation, but not snow. Indirect effect: The increase in warm air can contribute to a general rise in temperatures, which might lead to less snowfall over time. Warmer air, in turn, could have an impact on weather patterns, influencing the distribution and frequency of snowfall in various regions. As the atmosphere becomes warmer due to climate change or other factors, the likelihood of snow formation may decrease in certain areas as the temperature threshold for snow formation is not met as frequently or consistently as before."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When people get to be in charge for a long time, they might stop doing what's best for everyone. In places like California, they made rules so leaders can only stay for some time. This made more people want to be leaders and they had different backgrounds. It's hard for new people to become leaders when the old ones stay for too long.

Choices: * Gas powered fireplaces. * traditional fireplaces. Who is they referring to?","output":"In the given statement, \\"they\\" refers to the traditional fireplaces. The statement is comparing gas powered fireplaces to traditional fireplaces in terms of their environmental friendliness. Traditional fireplaces require wood for combustion, whereas gas powered fireplaces use natural gas or propane as a fuel source.  The reason why the statement suggests that gas powered fireplaces are more environmentally friendly than traditional fireplaces lies in the nature of the fuel sources and the combustion process.  When wood is burned in a traditional fireplace, it releases a variety of pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These pollutants can contribute to air pollution, health issues, and the greenhouse effect, causing harm to the environment and human health. Moreover, burning wood also produces creosote, a highly flammable byproduct that can accumulate in chimneys and cause dangerous chimney fires if not regularly cleaned. On the other hand, gas powered fireplaces use natural gas or propane as their fuel source. The combustion of these cleaner fuels produces fewer pollutants as compared to wood burning. While gas fireplaces still emit some pollutants like nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, the levels are significantly lower than those produced in wood burning fireplaces. Additionally, gas powered fireplaces do not produce creosote and have a lesser risk of causing chimney fires.  Furthermore, gas fireplaces are more energy-efficient than traditional ones, as they utilize almost all the fuel for heating and have lower heat loss through the chimney. This increased efficiency can also be seen as an environmentally friendly feature. It is important to mention that though gas powered fireplaces might be considered more environmentally friendly when compared to traditional wood burning fireplaces, they are not completely free of environmental impact. The extraction, production, and transportation of natural gas or propane are associated with their own environmental challenges, like methane leaks and greenhouse gas emissions during the production process. However, in terms of their combustion process and emissions during usage, gas powered fireplaces have a lower environmental impact than traditional fireplaces that burn wood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

Kate studied statins, while Carol studied anti-depressants.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student learned less about rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Now, let's compare the information in both sentences to determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first. In Sentence 1, we know that Al Gore raised soft money for the DNC, but the actual amount is not mentioned. In Sentence 2, it states that Al Gore raised 10 million for the DNC. Based on the information provided in the two sentences, we cannot say that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence because the first sentence does not provide any information about the specific amount of money raised by Al Gore for the DNC."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,... My question: What does Danny drive? Answer:","output":"Danny drives a vintage Austin Seven."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group had more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0?? A:","output":"Based on the provided information from the nutrition study, it can be concluded that Group B likely had more people with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30.0. Group A maintained a normal diet throughout the two years, which implies that they consumed a balanced number of calories necessary for their bodies to function optimally. A normal diet would typically consider factors such as age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level to ensure an individual is consuming the appropriate number of calories to maintain a healthy body weight. As a result, it is expected that most people in Group A would have a BMI within the healthy range of 18.5 to 24.9. On the other hand, Group B consumed an extra 1000 calories per day for two years. This additional caloric intake would have likely caused substantial weight gain for the individuals in this group. As their calorie consumption was consistently higher than what their bodies required, this excess energy would be stored as fat, leading to increased body weight. A BMI greater than 30.0 is classified as obese, and since individuals in Group B experienced significant weight gain, it can be inferred that more people in Group B had a BMI greater than 30.0. This increased BMI may also be associated with a higher risk of developing obesity-related health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. It is important to note that while BMI can be a useful indicator of body composition and health risks, it should not be the sole determinant of a person's overall health status. Other factors, such as muscle mass, bone density, and lifestyle habits, should also be considered when assessing a person's well-being."},{"instruction":"Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which country would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply, Germany or France?  After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Available choices: A. negative; B. positive; TEXT:This is a very engrossing BBC-TV mini-series which is loosely based upon a mysterious disappearance of a young mother, but the series is really more of a study of the assorted characters in the story, which lasts for five hours. It is thus very much an ensemble piece, where the wide variety of brilliant British actors and actresses can show off their talents. The actual characters portrayed are really 'the kind of people one does not normally meet', people so boring and nondescript that it is difficult to admire them. For instance, the lead character is a young husband (the one whose wife disappears) who has no job and no apparent interest in finding any. He lives off handouts from his parents-in-law. He was once in the Army but does not appear to have the slightest flicker of any ambition or any interests in life apart from doting on his small family. He is played by David Oyelowo, who is brilliant at the part, coming across as a totally sympathetic person, although his only activities for five hours are loving and grieving, which he does superbly, so that one wants to comfort him, as he is so obviously a nice guy. The standout performance of the whole series is unquestionably Penelope Wilton, who acts circles round everyone else in the story. She is simply incredible. She portrays a very unsympathetic woman, indeed the only character in the story who is all too familiar to everyone, namely an irrational, hysterical, self-centred, dense, querulous, blindly loving and blindly hating, elderly idiot-woman. Alas, alas, we know them too well. Wilton is one of Britain's finest actresses (see my review of her in 'Half Broken Things'). She takes a character who could have been two-dimensional and makes her four-dimensional. She is wonderfully supported by old pro Patrick Malahide, who plays her exasperated husband, and the pair of them set a high standard indeed for all the younger players. Janet McTeer, a spectacular actress when younger, has become a much less sympathetic type of person now that she is older, has coarsened in some way, and puts one off, but she redeems herself in the latter stages of the story by showing how brilliant an actress she can be when she has a chance by pulling off one of the most convincing and original drunk scenes I have ever seen on film. The big surprise is the enigmatic character Sarah, played with great depth and originality by actress Sarah Smart. She takes a character who could have been insufferably tedious and by sheer acting magic turns her into a deeply mysterious and intriguing person, about whom we wonder tirelessly for the entire five hours. She is so good at it that we end up wondering about Sarah Smart, frankly. I guess that's what happens when you really do your job properly, that people wonder where the character ends and the actress begins, if she knows herself, that is, and many do not. She has some deeply unnerving tricks with her eyes, which wobble and let us know she is unhinged, but we are not sure how or why, though we eventually learn that she had an extremely violent and traumatic childhood. Her mastery of ambiguous facial expressions is extraordinary. Rory Kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much, but who turns out to have hidden depths. (I suppose most people have hidden depths, but do we want to plumb them, that is the question.) His mum is played very well indeed by Margot Leicester. A superb performance is given by Lucinda Dryzek, who plays a snotty, revolting teenage girl of the sort we all dread to meet, but who at crucial moments collapses in helpless tears and turns out to be pathetic, with all her arrogance just a pose. Three other children are also very good, Lucinda's friend, and her younger half-brother and half-sister. The younger siblings may be very dim indeed as characters in the story (they seem unable to say anything particularly articulate, being hopeless witnesses to the disappearance), with little to recommend them but their sweet natures, but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by Lee Massey as the boy and Tyler Anthony as the girl. Harriet Walter has a small role, but we do not get to see much of her, which is a shame, as she is such a fine actress that she was wasted here. One could go on, but one must draw a line somewhere. The series manages to be strangely fascinating because of the depth of portrayal of all these essentially uninteresting people caught up in a web of intense anxiety and suspense.","output":"B. positive Explanation: The text contains a detailed analysis of a TV mini-series, focusing on the excellent acting and depth of the characters.

The streets of... (Associated Press)      At the annual fiesta in Bunol on Wednesday, trucks dumped 125 tons of ripe tomatoes for some 22,000 participants —many from abroad — to throw during the hour-long morning festivities.      This was the second year non-resident participants were charged — 10 euros (13) — to take part. The town of about 20,000 people began charging to help pay off debts of some 5.5 million euros. The event was sold out weeks ahead.      The event was inspired by a food fight between local children in 1945 in the tomato-producing region. ||||| Published: 27 Aug 2014 08:56 GMT+02:00      Thousands of half-naked revellers will pelt each other with squishy tomatoes on Wednesday in Spain's Tomatina, a world-renowned fiesta stained this year by a row over its privatization.      Popular with visitors from Britain, Australia, the United States and Japan, the Tomatina brings the small eastern town of Buñol to world attention once a year for an orgy of goo dubbed \\"the world's biggest food fight\\".      Mindful of safety and finances, the indebted local authorities last year began charging revellers an entry fee and hiring a private company, Spaintastic, to sell tickets.      The town hall vowed to improve safety at the wild festival, in which participants drink sangria and splash around in the red juice and pulp.      Before the privatization around 40,000 revellers would cram into the town, quadrupling its population. Places are now limited to 22,000.      Check out the best photos from Spain's La Tomatina festival 2013      \\"In the past few years the essence of the Tomatina had been lost. There was no space and it was quite dangerous,\\" Buñol's deputy mayor and top Tomatina official Rafael Perez told news agency AFP.      \\"Now it is much more enjoyable and Buñol locals who had stopped attending are coming back to it.\\"      The entry fee \\"has enabled us to finance the fiesta and make it safer\\".      'Corruption' slur      This year organizers have offered 5,000 tickets free to locals, while a further 17,000 have been sold -- most via tour companies that bus revellers to Buñol and fill them with sangria and paella.      They have also launched a music festival to keep revellers in town after the one-hour tomato-pelting ritual ends at noon (1000 GMT) on Wednesday.      The privatization of the popular and lucrative event has sparked squabbling among politicians in the town.      Spain's governing conservative Popular Party — in opposition in Buñol — has demanded an investigation into whether it is carried out legally by the town hall, led by the United Left party.      \\"We cannot look the other way when there has been a suspected case of corruption in an illegal privatization of the festival,\\" the PP's local spokesman Marcial Diaz told AFP.      He said his party supported privatizing the Tomatina but alleged that Spaintastic \\"was awarded this business arbitrarily without any kind of public contract or bidding process\\".      The deputy mayor Perez denied the allegations, branding the PP's lawsuit \\"a purely political move\\".      \\"People in Buñol don't understand it. There is great anger about this,\\" he said.      \\"They are soiling the image of Buñol and of the Tomatina. But we are not worried. We have most of the people of Buñol on our side.\\"      Spaintastic, the company that sells the tickets refused to comment on the controversy when contacted by The Local earlier this year.      Perez said that so far this year the Tomatina had brought in €170,000 (224,000) in ticket sales for the town hall and a further 10,000 euros in sponsorship.      Like many Spanish towns, Buñol is deep in debt after Spain's financial crisis.      SEE ALSO: Spain's top craziest festivals: The Local gallery      According to a survey by financial newspaper Cinco Dias based on figures from the Spanish treasury, Buñol was €5.5 million in the red in 2013.      The Tomatina started in the 1940s when locals brawling in the street at a folk festival seized tomatoes from a greengrocer's stall and hurled them at each other.      This year participants will throw 125,000 tonnes of tomatoes produced specially for the Tomatina despite complaints that it is a shameful a waste of food. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The Tomatina Festival is an annual event held in the town of Buñol, Spain, where thousands of participants from around the world gather to engage in a massive tomato fight.

Her boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to attend to his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death when he was hit by a bus.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What do Logan and Jessica notice are no longer operational once outside? Life-clocks Answer:","output":"Title: Timeless Horizon Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-fi, Drama Plot: In the year 2145, the world has been introduced to the life-clock – a revolutionary piece of technology designed by the enigmatic corporation, \\"Optimal Solutions.\\" The life-clock is implanted into every human at birth, measuring and displaying the remaining time a person has left to live. Once their time runs out, they quietly pass away. This global movement has led to a society with no crime, no violence, and no poverty – as everyone is motivated to make the best of their remaining time.  Logan (an accomplished scientist working for Optimal Solutions) and Jessica (a journalist looking into the corporation's activities) are both lifelong friends, growing up in a city encased in Optimal Solutions's sophisticated megastructure. This swath of technology runs the entire city under a tightly controlled grid, connected to the life-clocks of all individuals residing within the city. The grid, however, also detects people who have a few moments left before their time expires, urging them to exit the city and head to a mysterious \\"transition zone\\" beyond the city walls. Suspicion begins to grow in Logan about what goes on in the city. Furthermore, Jessicas closely follows the increasing number of suicides, all of which appear to be related to people realizing that they may have a finite time still remaining. Logan and Jessica decide to explore the transition zone in question, only to find that once they step beyond the city walls, their life-clocks no longer seem to be functioning. Outside the city, they stumble upon a hidden utopian society called \\"Elysium,\\" where no one ages, everyone is healthy, and life-clocks are useless. The people of Elysium warmly greet them and share their profound secret – they have discovered a way to disable and nullify the life-clocks, enabling them to live free of Optimal Solutions's control and restrictions. Amazed by this revelation, Logan and Jessica learn about the ancient technology that Elysium uses to counteract the life-clocks. As it turns out, the life-clock system was designed by the corporation, not to promote peace, but to ultimately exert control over humanity and keep the population in check.  Realizing the immorality of the life-clock system and driven by their desire to liberate the city from Optimal Solutions's dominance, Logan and Jessica lead the Elysium people on a daring mission to infiltrate the city. Their objective: to destroy the megastructure supporting the life-clock grid and free everyone from the bondage of limited, controlled lives. As they return to the city, they face numerous challenges, including a formidable city defense system activated by Optimal Solutions to protect their grip on the populace. Logan, Jessica, and the Elysium resistance must contend with a variety of technical and military obstacles. Their friendships and motivations are put to the test, and they must stay true to themselves and to each other throughout the journey. In the thrilling climax, Logan and Jessica face off against the sinister figurehead of Optimal Solutions, who tries to persuade them that the world would descend into chaos without the life-clock system. Despite this attempt to sway them, the duo infiltrates the company headquarters, disables the life-clock grid, and releases the information about the life-clocks' true purpose to the world. As the disgraced Optimal Solutions faces global consequences, the citizens of the city, now aware they are no longer controlled by their life-clocks, swarm outside, curious about the utopia beyond their borders. As they bask in their newfound freedom, Logan and Jessica look towards a new horizon, hoping to usher in an era where humanity can determine its own destiny. Timeless Horizon is a heart-pounding adventure of self-discovery, sacrifice, and the struggle against a seemingly insurmountable system, with our protagonists choosing whether to accept their deterministic lives or risk everything to live on their own terms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trains and cars are different means of transportation. A train refers to a series of connected vehicles traveling on a railroad track and serves to transport people or goods long distances. On the other hand, a car usually refers to an automobile, which is usually a smaller, more individualized and flexible mode of transportation for relatively shorter distances. The people are specifically identified as on a train in your statement. It indicates that they are traveling or seated inside the train. Using \\"on,\\" you're describing people being in a train for a journey, not inside an individual car (as in an automobile). However, it should be noted that in some contexts, especially in relation to trains, the word \\"car\\" can be used to describe the individual sections of a train. So, if by \\"car\\" you are referring to a carriage or compartment within the train, then it could be understood as the people are sitting in a car of the train. But that would require further clarification of the context. Without further context or information, we couldn't make that assumption based solely on the original statement. Remember that clear and precise communication is crucial for avoiding misunderstandings.

Both nations have vehemently defended their respective lumber industries, resulting in increased tensions and a series of lawsuits. The necessity to come to an understanding has become more evident as each country's economy is considerably impacted by the timber industry. The conclusion of this matter would restore balance in tariffs and quotas, allowing for a more equitable distribution of softwood across the borders. In forging this new agreement, Canada and the United States are demonstrating a commitment to settle disputes amicably, ensuring that both countries benefit from the arrangement. The deal is expected to support the growth and development of each nation's lumber industry while maintaining healthy competition and fair trade practices. Moving forward, it is essential for both countries to continue robust communication and collaboration to further strengthen their relationship and to resolve any future challenges that may arise in the lumber trade. This softwood agreement signifies an optimistic future for the timber industries of Canada and the United States, leading to increased economic prosperity and collaboration between these two North American powerhouses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, on Long Island, to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes (De Niro), her mother Dina (Danner) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of football. Meanwhile Pam informs Greg that she's pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack.

Please answer the following question: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

When did the narrator bring the record to his father? - not enough information - After dancing with his mother - After winning eBay auction - After going to Glen Island Casino A:","output":"The narrator brought the record to his father after winning the eBay auction. The passage explains that the narrator acquired a spool of recording wire with a date written on it, as part of a lot purchased on eBay. This lot also included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf. Intrigued by the mysterious date on the recording wire, which indicated that Glenn Miller should have already died when the recording was presumably made, the narrator decided to share this rare find with their father, who had a deep emotional connection to Glenn Miller. The father's attachment to Glenn Miller originates from the memories of dancing with the narrator's mother at Glen Island Casino in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. During those early days of World War II, the unique sound of Glenn Miller's music became intertwined with the sentiments of first love and idealism, which resonated deeply with their father. Bringing the mysterious recording to their father not only stirred up lively discussions about Miller's music but also evoked a sense of nostalgia and fondness for the past. However, both the father and older sister Ann reacted with skepticism and disapproval when the narrator played the recording. Their father noted that Glenn Miller would not have played with such a chaotic and seemingly inebriated band, even though the trombone solo had the same muffed notes as in the original Victor version of \\"King Porter Stomp.\\" Consequently, the narrator's attempt to share this peculiar find only brought about questions and doubts, rather than a shared appreciation for the music. In conclusion, the narrator brought the record to their father after winning the eBay auction, hoping to uncover more information about this puzzling recording and perhaps share a meaningful connection to Glenn Miller's music with their father. Though they were unsuccessful in doing so, the encounter sheds light on family dynamics, the significance of music in shaping one's personal history, and the endless mysteries that can arise from unexpected discoveries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two sentences do not mean exactly the same, although they convey some similar information. Let me explain the differences between them in detail. First sentence: \\"The museum operated the locomotive and leased the North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719 through its subsidiary.\\" In this sentence, the museum is the subject, and there are two main actions that the museum is responsible for: 1. Operating the locomotive. 2. Leasing the North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719. The additional information provided in the sentence is that these actions were carried out \\"through its subsidiary,\\" meaning that a company owned or controlled by the museum was directly responsible for performing these tasks. Second sentence: \\"The museum leased the locomotive and operated through its subsidiary North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719.\\" This sentence now suggests that: 1. The museum is leasing the locomotive. 2. The museum is being operated through its subsidiary (The North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719). In this case, the focus of the operations is shifted from the locomotive to the museum itself. The action specified in this sentence indicates that the museum is being operated by its subsidiary, which is now explicitly identified as the North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719. To summarize, the first sentence implies that the museum, through a subsidiary, operates the locomotive and leases the North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the museum leases the locomotive and is being operated through its subsidiary, the North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719.

Image caption The eastern city of Deir al-Zour has seen fierce fighting since the uprising began      Rebels have attacked a village in eastern Syria, killing dozens of Shia Muslim residents, most of them pro-government fighters, activists say.      The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said at least 60 people died in Hatla on Tuesday.      The attack appeared to be retaliation for a raid on a rebel position by people from the village, it added.      Meanwhile, a government helicopter has reportedly fired three missiles at the northern Lebanese border town of Arsal.      Lebanese officials said one of the missiles had struck the town centre, and that a woman and her daughter were slightly hurt.      Arsal is a predominantly Sunni town about 15km (9 miles) from the Syrian border that is home to some 27,000 Syrian refugees.      It was used as a staging-post by Syrian rebels during the recent battle for the strategically important town of Qusair.      Qusair was recaptured by the army last week with help from the Lebanese Shia Islamist movement, Hezbollah.      The situation in the village is quiet and the [rebel] Free Syrian Army is in full control Thaer al-Deiry, Activist in Deir al-Zour province      'Apostate rejectionists'      According to activists, the fighting in Hatla, a predominantly Shia village just to the east of the city of Deir al-Zour, started after pro-government Shia militiamen mounted an attack on a nearby rebel position on Monday, killing at least two opposition fighters.      The rebels then massed for an attack and overran Hatla the next day. The SOHR reported that 60 Shia residents were killed, most of them fighters who had been armed by the government a few weeks earlier.      At least 10 rebels were killed in the fighting on Tuesday, and surviving Shia residents of Hatla were forced to flee to nearby Jafra, it added.      The London-based Syrian Network of Human Rights also said 60 people had been killed, while an activist in Deir al-Zour province, Thaer al-Deiry, confirmed the rebel attack had been in retaliation for an earlier raid.      \\"The situation in the village is quiet and the [rebel] Free Syrian Army is in full control,\\" he told the Associated Press.      Image caption A video posted online on Tuesday purportedly showed jihadist rebel fighters in Hatla      A video posted online on Tuesday, entitled The Storming And Cleansing of Hatla, showed dozens of gunmen carrying the black flags associated with jihadist groups, celebrating and firing weapons in the streets of a small town.      \\"We have raised the banner [saying] 'There is no God but God' above the houses of the apostate rejectionists, the Shia, and the holy warriors are celebrating,\\" the cameraman says, according to the Reuters news agency.      \\"This is a Sunni area. It does not belong to other groups,\\" one fighter shouts in the video.      A government official in Damascus said the rebels had \\"carried out a massacre against villagers in which older people and children were killed\\".      Hezbollah said Shia clerics, their wives and children had been among those killed in what it called an act of sectarian cleansing, inspired by prominent Sunni clerics in the region who have issued calls for Sunnis to go to Syria to join the battle against President Bashar al-Assad.      The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the incident has underlined the deepening sectarian nature of the struggle in Syria.      The two-year-old conflict pits rebels who are mostly from the majority Sunni community against government forces led by Mr Assad's Alawite sect, a heterodox offshoot of Shia Islam.      Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague is to travel to Washington on Wednesday for talks with his US counterpart John Kerry to discuss the West's response to the continued bloodshed, including whether to begin supplying the rebels with weapons.      On Tuesday, French foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot said the conflict in Syria was \\"at a turning point\\".      \\"What should we do under these conditions to reinforce the opposition armed forces? We have had these discussions with our partners, with the Americans, the Saudis, the Turks, many others.\\"      \\"We cannot leave the opposition in the current state,\\" he added.      More than 80,000 people have been killed and 1.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries since the uprising against Mr Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The attack was another sign of how a revolt that began more than two years ago with peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule is descending into sectarian bloodshed.      A video posted online by rebels on Tuesday, entitled \\"The storming and cleansing of Hatla\\" showed dozens of gunmen carrying black Islamist flags celebrating and firing guns in the streets of a small town as smoke curled above several buildings.      \\"We have raised the banner 'There is no God but God' above the houses of the apostate rejectionists, the Shi'ites, and the holy warriors are celebrating,\\" the voice of the cameraman says.      In the Damascus area, rebels reported that 27 of their comrades had been killed in an ambush near the town of al-Maraj.      Video uploaded by activists showed victims shot in the face or head. The camera scanned over several bloodied and dirt-coated corpses as men called out for help washing the bodies.      Musaab Abu Qutada, an opposition activist, said the men had been trying to break through a military blockade to bring supplies into rebel strongholds in suburbs of the capital.      Assad's forces, backed by the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah, won a significant victory by seizing the border town of Qusair last week and are now believed to be preparing offensives on rebel-held areas near Damascus and Aleppo.      Many of the fighters involved in the Hatla attack were said to be from the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Hardline Sunni groups often refer to Shi'ites as rejectionists because they deny the legitimacy of the Prophet Mohammad's first successors.      \\"This is a Sunni area, it does not belong to other groups,\\" one fighter shouted in the video purportedly filmed in the town of Hatla in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor.      The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group that has reported abuses on both sides of the conflict, put the death toll in Tuesday's attack at 60, saying most victims were pro-Assad Shi'ite militiamen. Assad's minority Alawite sect is rooted in Shi'ite Islam. Most rebels are Sunnis.      The Observatory said many Shi'ite civilians, a minority in the mixed town of Hatla, had fled elsewhere in the province.      ANTI-HEZBOLLAH PROTESTS      The conflict in Syria has stoked Sunni-Shi'ite tensions in the region, with Iran and Hezbollah supporting Assad, and Sunni-ruled nations such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar backing the rebels. Sunni militants have also poured in to help the rebels.      Dozens of Kuwaitis gathered outside the Lebanese Embassy in Kuwait late on Tuesday to protest against Hezbollah's role in Syria. Protesters burned a picture of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a photo published in local media showed.      \\"The mujahideen in Lebanon are preparing ... for the battle which you started, Hezbollah,\\" a Kuwaiti cleric named Shafi al-Ajami said in a video of the demonstration posted on YouTube.      \\"We are arming the mujahideen from here (Kuwait), and from the Arabian Peninsula, the Gulf states, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey,\\" he said.      He said funds for the effort were coming from \\"honorable people\\", not governments. Kuwaiti Islamists have started a Twitter campaign named \\"Kuwaitis prepare 12,000 mujahideen\\" as well as an online fundraising drive to help arm Syrian rebels.      Ajami said Syria would become \\"the graveyard for the party of Satan\\" - a common slur used by rebels against Hezbollah, whose name means \\"party of God\\" in Arabic.      In Hatla, some opposition activists said the attack included summary killings and the burning of Shi'ite places of worship.      Activist Karam Badran, who spoke to Reuters from Deir al-Zor, said only 20 people had been confirmed killed in Hatla but that another 20 had been taken hostage by the rebels.      He said the attackers' main motive was not sectarian, but what he and the Observatory said were government attempts to recruit militiamen of all faiths in an area rebels had held for a year. Shi'ites had not previously been harmed there, he said.      Badran said the Hatla killings had also followed an attack on Monday by pro-Assad militiamen on a rebel checkpoint outside the provincial capital Deir al-Zor, in which several opposition fighters had been killed and dozens wounded.      \\"Three of the men killed were three Shi'ite clerics. They were executed and hung on the gates of the town,\\" Badran said. \\"But among the dead were also Sunnis (who had joined pro-Assad militia).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence from a movie review: desperate miscalculation  Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? Select from the following. i. negative. ii. positive.","output":"Based on the sentence \\"desperate miscalculation\\" from a movie review, it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The term \\"desperate\\" has a negative connotation, and when combined with \\"miscalculation,\\" it suggests that the person critiquing the film feels that there was a significant error or poor judgment made in some aspect of the movie. This could be in the plot, dialogue, acting, or other features that contribute to a film's overall quality and appeal. Moreover, when analyzing the language used in movie reviews, it is essential to pay attention to the emotional tone or sentiment expressed by the reviewer. The use of words with negative connotations can signal a disapproval of the film, while words with positive connotations would typically indicate the reviewer's enjoyment or satisfaction. In this specific case, the choice of \\"desperate\\" conveys a sense of urgency or extreme need. It implies that the movie failed to deliver the desired outcome and made a bad attempt to achieve it, or compromised the intended message or purpose. \\"Miscalculation\\" further supports this negative sentiment by suggesting a misunderstanding or an incorrect assessment in executing the film's creative vision. These two words together indicate that the reviewer found the film lacking in quality or substance. Therefore, based on the analysis of the language used in the sentence \\"desperate miscalculation,\\" it is safe to conclude that the reviewer had a negative perception of the movie.

Question: Which dog does not break free? Movie title: Eight Below Movie plot: In 1993, Jerry Shepard is a guide at an Antarctica research base under contract with the National Science Foundation. UCLA professor, Dr. Davis McClaren, arrives at the base. He presses Shepard to take him to Mount Melbourne to find a rare meteorite from Mercury. Shepard decides that the only way to get to Mount Melbourne is by dog sled. Shepard and McClaren make it to Mount Melbourne, but are called back to base camp due to an approaching heavy storm. McClaren begs for more time, and Shepard gives him half a day, which is enough time to find a fragment of the meteorite. En route back to base, McClaren slips down an embankment, breaking his leg and falling into freezing water. Shepard uses the lead dog Maya to carry a rope to McClaren and pulls him out. The two battle hypothermia, frostbite and near whiteout conditions as the dogs lead them home. Once there, the entire human crew is immediately evacuated, while the dogs are left behind. Certain that their pilot will return within days for the dogs, Shepard tightens their collars to ensure they cannot get loose and run away. Because of the harsh weather conditions, no rescue will be attempted until the next spring - and by then the dogs will be dead. Back at home, Shepard tries to secure a plane to return and save the dogs, but no one is willing to finance the risky expedition. Five months later, Shepard makes one last attempt to get back. McClaren realizes the magnitude of his ingratitude and uses the remaining balance of his grant money to finance a rescue mission. Shepard acknowledges that there is almost no chance that any of the dogs have survived this long, but he owes it to his team to go back for them. After being left behind, the eight sled dogs â lead dog Maya, Old Jack, Shorty, Dewey, Truman, Shadow, Buck, and the young Max, wait in the freezing conditions for Shepard to return.

This week, Trump will resume pressing congressional Republicans to pass a tax reform measure to follow through on one of his key campaign promises. Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform. So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\"  However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president. \\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik. Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives.

The speaker further highlights the significance of promoting economic and social development, which is essential for the overall growth and betterment of a region or a nation. Economic development is crucial because it fosters the creation of job opportunities, encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, and helps to raise the living standards of a population. By focusing on equitable growth, wealth disparities can be minimized, allowing for a more inclusive society where everyone has access to essential services and opportunities. Social development, on the other hand, encompasses various components such as healthcare, education, and social protection. By ensuring equal access to these services, societies can foster a healthier, more informed, and resilient population. Moreover, social development can help address particular societal challenges, such as gender inequality and social exclusion, thereby working towards a more inclusive and egalitarian society.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  A witch  for the following movie plot:  Shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Union Intermediate High School (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) was one of many schools around the country increasing security measures to prevent school shootings. Brandi Blackbear wrote horror stories similar to those of Stephen King, dressed in a slightly Gothlike way, and was not afraid to be herself, or to stand up to bullying by popular kids. Her defiance engendered hostility toward her from certain segments of her school's culture. False stories of threats of violence were circulated, and the combination of her writing and authorities' natural hyperawareness following Columbine led to her being suspended. When some of her fellow students later saw her checking out a book on world religions, including Wicca (as research for her stories), they immediately branded her a witch, and eventually accused her of casting a spell that made a teacher sick. Fear of her spread through much of the school, and she was once again suspended.Finally, her parents went to the ACLU, where they were told they had a good case against the school for violating her civil rights. The ACLU sued the affluent school for 10 million, even though the Blackbears were not sure they deserved that much based on what Brandi had suffered. Still, the ACLU argued that the school would not take any lesser claim seriously. When the school offered a settlement, the Blackbears refused. They were not interested in the money, despite needing it; what they really wanted was to have their story heard in court to inform the public that the school had mistreated Brandi. The judge ruled to dismiss the charges rather than going to trial, and ordered the Blackbears to pay 6000 in court fees, which they could not afford. Eventually it was agreed to drop the fees if the Blackbears dropped their appeal.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... Answer:","output":"Camille"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects. Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance while Westenberg took pictures of him is Oliver. This refers to Vaughan Oliver, the longtime 4AD album designer who created the cover art for the mentioned album, Pod."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The first of which make of car came off the assembly line at Fisherman's Bend in September 1948? What is the answer?","output":"The first make of car that came off the assembly line at Fisherman's Bend in September 1948 was the Holden 48-215, also known as the Holden FX. Fisherman's Bend, located in Port Melbourne, Australia, was home to General Motors-Holden's (GM-H) new manufacturing plant, which was responsible for producing Australia's first mass-produced car. Holden, an Australian automobile manufacturer, was a subsidiary of the American company General Motors. In the early 20th century, Holden was primarily involved in the production of horse saddles, leather goods, and later, vehicle bodies. However, with the establishment of the manufacturing plant at Fisherman's Bend and strong backing from General Motors, the company was able to debut its first full-scale automobile in 1948. The Holden FX (48-215) was a milestone for the Australian automobile industry and a significant achievement for Holden as a car manufacturer. It was specifically designed and developed to suit Australian terrain and driving conditions. The car featured an all-steel monocoque construction, a revolutionary feature for its time, which provided a more rigid, lightweight, and safer structure compared to traditional body-on-frame designs. This construction method not only enhanced the vehicle's strength but also contributed to improved handling and fuel efficiency. Under the hood, the Holden FX was equipped with a 2.15L straight-six engine, which was linked to a three-speed manual transmission. The engine produced approximately 60 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque, promising impressive performance for its time. The car's rear-wheel-drive layout allowed for better weight distribution and handling, while the fully-independent front suspension made for a more comfortable ride. Upon its release, the Holden FX received an overwhelmingly positive response from the Australian public. It was praised for its robustness and reliability, and quickly became known as the ultimate \\"Australian family car\\" for its practicality and affordability. This success laid the foundation for Holden's dominance in the Australian automobile market for several decades. Even though Holden ceased its manufacturing operations in Australia in 2017, the automobile giant's legacy continues with its rich history, and the Holden 48-215 remains a symbol of Australian automotive innovation and ingenuity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko? , can you please find it?   English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of...","output":"The name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko, is M.I.A.'s son, Ikyhd. M.I.A., also known as Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam, gave birth to her son in February 2009 and began composing and recording her third studio album six months later. During the recording sessions, M.I.A. collaborated with various artists including Rusko. Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, mentioned in an interview that they recorded the heartbeat of M.I.A.'s one-year-old son, Ikyhd. The recording of the baby's heartbeat was used to incorporate a unique element into the album, showcasing the creativity of M.I.A. and her collaborators. M.I.A. and Rusko appreciated the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they managed to create during their long recording sessions, which sometimes lasted up to 30 hours.  This recording process commenced in a home studio section of M.I.A.'s Los Angeles house, which she shared with her partner Ben Bronfman. M.I.A. called the working environment at her house a \\"commune environment,\\" as the album was largely created there before being completed in a rented studio in Hawaii.  In addition to Rusko, M.I.A. collaborated with other artists and producers such as Blaqstarr and Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds.\\" Due to M.I.A.'s creativity and dedication to producing engaging music, her albums continue to garner critical acclaim and commercial success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why is the “mainstream” media attacking Trump for visiting Louisiana when Obama is doing nothing but playing golf as reported by the same media? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions posed are different in nature but have a common ground - they both point towards the role and perception of the mainstream media in shaping public opinion and narrative on given situations. Firstly, the question related to Kim Kardashian and porn stars, addresses the discrepancy between the media's treatment of Kim Kardashian and performers in the adult film industry. The mainstream media's attention to Kim Kardashian can be attributed to several factors: 1. Celebrity culture: Despite Kim Kardashian's rise to fame starting with a leaked sex tape, she has since strategically built a brand on her image and her family's lifestyle. They have successfully turned into a reality TV empire, and the media's coverage of Kim's life sells stories and attracts audiences. 2. Sensationalism: Mainstream media thrive on sensationalism. Kim Kardashian's lifestyle, relationships, and personal experiences, are often portrayed in a way that provokes curiosity and debate. This interest in her life is profitable for the media and becomes a self-perpetuating cycle of coverage. 3. Changing cultural norms: Though Kim Kardashian's initial claim to fame emerged from the release of a sex tape, society has evolved since then, with more progressive and inclusive attitudes towards sex and sexuality. As a result, Kim's celebrity status has overshadowed the controversial origins of her fame. On the other hand, porn stars, who openly work in the adult film industry, tend to remain marginalized and stigmatized because: 1. Social taboos: Porn stars are often met with social stigma because they voluntarily participate in an industry that is still seen as scandalous and taboo by many. This may influence mainstream media to generally avoid legitimizing the work and lives of porn stars in their coverage. 2. Market viewership: Mainstream media also cater to a broader audience, which includes conservative and progressive viewers. Covering porn stars may alienate parts of their audience, thus making it less profitable and desirable for mainstream media organizations. Regarding the second question, the issue at hand is the perception of media bias and its impact on the public's understanding of political figures. This question specifically relates to President Trump and President Obama. The mainstream media's criticism of Trump visiting Louisiana contrasts with their reporting on Obama's absence from the same situation. This inconsistency may stem from several factors: 1. Political bias: Depending on individual publication and network affiliations, the media may harbor partisan perspectives. It is important to recognize that the mainstream media is not a monolithic entity, as different outlets may have different reporting standards and biases. 2. Polarizing personalities: Donald Trump has a polarizing personality, which tends to provoke stronger reactions from the media and the public. In contrast, President Obama was seen as a more measured individual. This difference in temperament may have influenced some media outlets to view Trump's visit to Louisiana more cynically than Obama's absence. 3. News cycle dynamics: The news cycle is fast-moving and competitive. It is not uncommon for the media to emphasize controversies and conflicts to maintain their audience's interest. The framing of such situations also depends on the events happening around that time, leading to fluctuations in coverage and prioritization. In sum, the two questions raised are not the same but share the underlying themes of media perception and potential bias. Both questions highlight the importance of context and understanding the complex relationship between media organizations, public figures, and the influence of celebrity and political culture."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: In recent years, temperatures in the polar areas are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and the snow are melting at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk. A sheet of ice acts like a huge mirror, reflecting the sun's energy. But ocean water, which is darker than ice, absorbs a lot of it. This causes the ocean to warm, which in turn speeds up ice melting and which leads to even more open waters. The cycle continues until all the ice is gone. \\"As the ice melts, water flows into the oceans, making them less salty. That, along with warmer water temperatures, can harm the creatures that live in, under, and near the ice,\\" says zoologist Michael Stoddard. \\"Cold-adapted animals -- including polar bears, foxes, hares, and seals -- also need ice for travel and survival.\\" \\"Most species of fish, sea spiders, and many other animals and plants that live in the waters of Antarctica don't live anywhere else,\\" Stoddard says. \\"Many of them have special proteins in their bodies keeping them from freezing to death and have other adaptation to the cold that has yet to be explored.\\" Therefore, experts are urging us to reconsider the way we live.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation -6*s - 172 = -184 for the variable s, we will follow these steps: 1. Isolate the term with the variable (s) on one side of the equation: -6*s - 172 + 172 = -184 + 172 2. Simplify the equation: -6*s = -12 3. To find the value of s, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which in this case is -6: s = -12 / -6 4. Simplify the equation to get the value of s: s = 2 So, the value of s in the equation -6*s - 172 = -184 is s = 2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They had women playing the recorder with their parts, men using their dicks to play a xylophone, women weeing upwards in the bath, men with or without pants under their kilts, and many more gross but hilarious ideas. This is just for adults, but enjoy it! It won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Programme or Series), it won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show, it won an Emmy for episode #18 (?), and it won the National Television Awards twice for Most Popular Talk Show.

It must have been exception because everyone else seemed to have better service.  The food: I tried the new york, hand tossed pepperoni pizza and the house salad with italian dressing; both orders came promptly. I was not too wild about the salad because it was nothing special (lettuce, tomato, cheese, carrot, etc.). The best part of the pizza here was the crust and everything else could have been better.

Answer:","output":"The best answer is: Carbon dioxide. Plants require several essential elements and factors for their growth. Some key elements include light, air, water, and nutrients. Carbon dioxide is a plant nutrient, as it is involved in the process of photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (energy) and oxygen. 1. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic material found in all living organisms, including plants, but it is not required directly for plant growth. 2. Hydrogen and Oxygen are components of water, which is essential for plant growth, but these elements alone do not cover all aspects of plant growth requirements. 3. Organic compounds, such as those from soil and decomposing matter, can provide plants with some nutrients, but they are not the only factors necessary for growth. 4. Electrical energy does not directly contribute to plant growth. 5. Heat energy is important for regulating plant growth, as it affects plant metabolism and development, but it is not the sole requirement. 6. Sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis, a process essential to plant growth. However, carbon dioxide is also involved in this process, making it more accurate. 7. Energy, in general, is required for plant growth, but it does not directly describe which specific components of energy that plants need.

Choose appropriate sources. Read your sources critically Incorporate primary sources, if applicable. Evaluate online sources carefully.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Unlocking the Full Potential of Research: Leveraging School Resources and Choosing Credible Sources Introduction In the age of information, the success of any research project heavily depends on the proper selection and evaluation of resources. As students, we often find ourselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of sources available at our fingertips. Unfortunately, without recognizing the importance of quality over quantity in our research, our work may end up lacking depth and credibility. In this article, we will delve into the significance of leveraging your school's resources, selecting appropriate sources, reading critically, incorporating primary sources when possible, and evaluating online sources with care. Taking Advantage of Your School's Resources Schools and universities typically provide a wide range of resources that are designed to support students in their research projects. These resources often include access to research databases, academic journals, and other scholarly materials that may not be easily accessible to the general public. 1. Library: The school library is an indispensable resource for any research project. Librarians can help you identify key sources related to your topic, locate hard-to-find materials, and provide guidance on citation styles. Additionally, the library likely subscribes to numerous scholarly databases and academic journals that are crucial for in-depth research. 2. Professors and advisers: Your professors and academic advisers are also valuable resources in your research journey. With their expertise in their respective fields, they can offer direction and suggestions regarding the most relevant sources or authors related to your topic. 3. Student research centers and services: Many schools have dedicated research centers or services to assist students with various aspects of research, from managing citations to editing papers. Utilizing these resources can help ensure your research process is well-organized and professional. Choosing Appropriate Sources Selecting appropriate sources is a fundamental step in ensuring the credibility of your research. This involves carefully considering the type and purpose of each source, its relevance to your research question, and its overall quality. 1. Align sources with your research objectives: Determine the types of sources that will be most beneficial to your research project. Are you seeking scholarly articles, case studies, or results from experimental research? Knowing what kind of information you need will help you filter your search and boost efficiency. 2. Evaluate source credibility: As you collect potential sources, consider the authority of their authors and publishers. Are they experts in the field? Are the sources published in reputable journals or by respected academic presses? Avoid sources with little or no supporting evidence or that appear to be biased. Reading Your Sources Critically Analyzing and engaging with your sources on a deeper level is essential for producing high-quality research. Critically reading your sources entails evaluating their methodologies, evidence, and arguments, while also identifying any potential biases or inconsistencies. 1. Take notes and annotate: As you read your sources, take comprehensive notes and highlight key concepts, themes, or arguments. This process aids in digesting the information and identifying patterns that will help form the basis of your research paper. 2. Ask critical questions: Reflect on the assumptions and motivations underlying the source materials. Are there any gaps or inconsistencies in the author's argument? Can you identify alternative interpretations or perspectives that might challenge the conclusions reached by the author? Incorporating Primary Sources Primary sources, such as correspondence, diaries, government documents, and eyewitness accounts, provide firsthand evidence or direct access to an event, phenomenon, or period of time. Whenever possible, researchers should incorporate primary sources into their projects. 1. Foster authentic understanding: Primary sources offer a unique and unfiltered perspective on historical, social, and cultural issues, allowing for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of your research subject. 2. Strengthen your argument: By providing direct evidence, primary sources help to support and strengthen the claims made in your research paper. Evaluating Online Sources Carefully The internet has revolutionized the research process. However, evaluating the credibility of online sources can be particularly challenging, as not all websites follow the same rigorous standards as traditional print resources. 1. Assess domain authority: Check whether the website is associated with a reputable institution, such as a university or national organization. Reliable domain extensions often include .edu, .gov, and .org. 2. Review the author's credentials and publication date: The author's expertise and the timeliness of the information should be verified. Outdated information may not be relevant to your research topic, and anonymous authors may lack credibility. 3. Cross-reference information: To validate the reliability of an online source, cross-reference its information with other reputable sources. If the facts and arguments align, it is more likely that the online source is trustworthy. Conclusion In conclusion, leveraging your school's resources, selecting appropriate sources, reading critically, and evaluating online sources meticulously play pivotal roles in the creation of a successful and credible research project. By employing these strategies, students can build a robust bibliography and establish themselves as knowledgeable and reliable researchers in their field."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Inspector Clouseau  for the following movie plot:  Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation. Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself. A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. Clouseau's actions embarrass the SÃ»retÃ© in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 11 Year Old Composer Will Premiere Her Opera (VIENNA)— Alma Deutscher is a composer, virtuoso pianist and concert violinist who wrote her first sonata five years ago and whose first full opera will have its world premiere next month — and she’s only 11. Time-worn associations with Mozart, who wrote his first symphony at age 8, may come to mind. So can questions whether Alma’s unique talent could get in the way of a happy childhood. But fresh from rehearsal, Alma laughs dismissively. “I think for me it’s more interesting to be Alma” instead of Mozart, she says. And being special “is really normal because I don’t know anything else.” When not living music, the child prodigy from Dorking, England, is busy scraping her knees climbing trees, meeting friends on the playground, swimming and many other activities that an 11-year-old would enjoy. But when focused on her passion, she’s all business. Rehearsing “Cinderella” recently, Alma gave instructions and sang phrases in a clear child’s soprano, switching from piano to violin and back as she accompanied the soloists. It all seemed effortless. But the slight child in the red woolen tights and floral print dress was clearly in charge — and enjoying running the show. The energy doesn’t stop flowing off stage. Alma doesn’t even try to sit still, gesturing and fidgeting as she talks about “Cinderella.” She says she’s “extremely excited” at the prospect of the Dec. 29 premiere in the ornate theater of Vienna’s Baumgarten palace. “I can’t wait until everything will come together,” she says. “I dream about how it’s going to look like on the stage.” Zubin Mehta, the patron of “Cinderella,” is only one of today’s conducting greats awed by her talent. Simon Rattle says he is “absolutely bowled over” by her and Daniel Barenboim has used similar terms. Violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter describes Alma’s performing and composing talents as “absolutely extraordinary.” Her father, Guy Deutscher, remembers her “singing almost before she started speaking” — and one day, coming home from a toddlers’ party singing a nursery rhyme in perfect pitch. Drives to the supermarket turned into tests of will, he said. Alma, normally “an extremely good-natured girl,” started screaming if her parents tried to get out of the car while music she loved was still playing. Deutscher describes parenting Alma as a challenge with huge rewards. “Waking up in the morning and your daughter coming and saying, ‘I have the most amazing melody, please come and listen’ … it’s an amazing feeling.” Alma recalls falling in love with music sometime after age 2. It was a Strauss lullaby, she says, and she was dumbfounded. “After it finished, I asked my parents, ‘how can music be so beautiful?’ Then I started having ideas of my own. I’d just sit down at the piano. I didn’t write my ideas down, I just had them in my head, and I played them. I was 4.” The music comes unbidden, says Alma. “If I try to sit down and think, ‘now I must get inspiration,’ then I just don’t get inspiration, it doesn’t come to me,” she explained. “But when I am not thinking about it at all, when I’m just relaxing, skipping in the garden and just about to fall asleep or just about to wake up — or when I’m actually in a dream — then I get the beautiful inspiration that I put together.” Future plans include a piano concerto and a symphony. She has started a book which she wants made into a film, complete with her own score. Alma says it features ghosts riding “night mares” and poisoning dreams by breathing toxic fumes. At the same time, she says she hasn’t read any of the Harry Potter books because “they’re too scary for me.” For now, the main focus is on “Cinderella,” delightful not only because of lovely melodies that sometimes draw on Mozart and other classical composers but also because of a charming twist to the familiar story.

Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \\"Lucky You\\".

Compost is nothing more than decomposed organic matter. The average compost pile contains a plethora of beneficial nutrients, including potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Choose your answer from: (1). Regarding nitrogen, the bacteria in compost break matter down into ammonium, which is then naturally converted by other bacteria into nitrates that plants can absorb through their roots. Compost high in nitrogen materials, including moist greens, fruits, and vegetables, tends to provide the highest content of nitrogen to the soil bed it is applied to. (2). Manure with sufficient nitrogen is your best bet for nitrogen fertilizer. If a pile of loosely composted compost contains hundreds or thousands of plants, you should avoid using compost as it is the top fertilizer for the garden. (3). Aim to repot manure every 4-6 months. For cloche, your compost pile should be as much compost as you intend to root your plant. (4). You can mix it up and feed it to your plants through the cuttings that are grown inside. Keep in mind that you can plant a pile of compost in a drier area that isn't the same temperature as your surrounding environment.","output":"(1).

Compost high in nitrogen materials, including moist greens, fruits, and vegetables, tends to provide the highest content of nitrogen to the soil bed it is applied to. Explanation: The correct answer is option 1 because it explains the process of how nitrogen is released from compost. The bacteria help break down the matter into ammonium before converting it into nitrates, which plants can absorb through their roots. The other options do not provide accurate or clear explanations about how nitrogen fertilizer is made from compost. Option 2: This option is wrong because it talks about manure and does not clearly explain how nitrogen is produced in compost. Option 3: This option is incorrect because it talks about repotting manure and seems to be focused on container gardening rather than composting as a source of nitrogen fertilizer. Option 4: This option is confusing and unclear. It is wrong because it discusses planting compost in different temperature conditions but does not explain how this relates to making nitrogen fertilizer."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

How is \\"Do you think that this is possible?\\" said in German?","output":"In German, the phrase \\"Do you think that this is possible?\\" can be translated to \\"Denkst du, dass das möglich ist?\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Do you think\\" – In German, this part of the phrase can be translated to \\"Denkst du.\\" \\"Denkst\\" is the second person singular informal conjugation of the verb \\"denken\\", which means \\"to think\\", and \\"du\\" is the informal second person pronoun, which means \\"you.\\" Note that \\"du\\" is used in informal situations, whereas \\"Sie\\" is the formal way to say \\"you.\\" 2. \\"that\\" – The word \\"that\\" can be translated to \\"dass\\" in German. \\"Dass\\" is a conjunction used in the same way we use \\"that\\" in English, to introduce a subordinate clause. Note that this is different from the word \\"das,\\" which is a definite article or a demonstrative pronoun. 3. \\"this\\" – The word for \\"this\\" in the context of the sentence is \\"das.\\" \\"Das\\" is a demonstrative pronoun that can also be translated as \\"that\\" in some cases, but in this context, it means \\"this.\\" Make sure not to confuse \\"das\\" (demonstrative pronoun) with \\"dass\\" (conjunction). 4. \\"is\\" – The verb \\"is\\" can be translated to \\"ist\\" in German. \\"Ist\\" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb \\"sein\\", which means \\"to be.\\" 5. \\"possible?\\" – The word \\"possible\\" can be translated to \\"möglich\\" in German. \\"Möglich\\" is an adjective which means \\"possible\\" or \\"feasible\\" and agrees in gender, case, and number with the noun it modifies. In this case, it matches with the neutral demonstrative pronoun \\"das.\\" So, putting all these translations together, you get \\"Denkst du, dass das möglich ist?\\" as the German translation of \\"Do you think that this is possible?\\" However, if you're addressing someone formally, you would use \\"Denken Sie, dass das möglich ist?\\" instead, where \\"Sie\\" is the formal second person pronoun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Health For All is a programming goal of the World Health Organization (WHO), which envisions securing the health and well being of people around the world that has been popularized since the 1970s. It is the basis for the World Health Organization's primary health care strategy to promote health, human dignity, and enhanced quality of life. Can we infer the following? Health For All is all about health","output":"Yes, Health For All is fundamentally about health, but it encompasses a much broader and comprehensive perspective on health and well-being than merely addressing specific diseases or medical issues. The ambition of Health For All is to create an equitable, comprehensive, and sustainable health care system for everyone, regardless of their socio-economic background, while also addressing the social determinants of health. Therefore, the concept of Health For All goes beyond just individual health problems and encompasses multiple dimensions of health at the global, national, and local levels. To thoroughly understand the scope of Health For All, it is essential to consider the following key aspects: 1. Equity in healthcare: Health For All aims to achieve equitable access to healthcare services for everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, geographic location, or any other barriers that might exist. Under this goal, healthcare should be a fundamental human right, and everyone should have the opportunity to achieve the highest possible level of health and well-being. 2. Primary healthcare approach: One of the main pillars of Health For All is the primary healthcare approach, which emphasizes the importance of prevention, public health, and health promotion as the foundation of a robust healthcare system. This approach entails focusing on the community's health needs and addressing them through comprehensive and localized healthcare strategies. This would include interventions around nutrition, sanitation, maternal and child care, essential preventive and curative services, and many other components. 3. Intersectoral collaboration: Health For All acknowledges that achieving global health goals requires a multi-sectoral approach that brings together diverse stakeholders such as government, non-profit organizations, private sector bodies, and communities. A strong collaboration between these stakeholders ensures that health policies and interventions are aligned, efficient, and effective in addressing various social determinants of health, such as education, housing, food security, and environmental conditions. 4. Community participation: Health For All values the role of communities in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare services and interventions. This participatory approach ensures that the unique needs of different populations are addressed, empowers communities to contribute to their health and well-being, and strengthens local health systems. 5. Sustainable development: The concept of Health For All is closely related to the goal of sustainable development, which includes health as one of its key dimensions. A sustainable approach to health requires considering the long-term impact of health policies and practices on societies, economies, and the environment, and adopting measures that ensure the well-being of present and future generations. 6. Holistic view of health: Health For All endorses a holistic view of health, which includes not only the absence of disease but also a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. This perspective recognizes that health is influenced by a range of factors, and addressing these in an integrated manner is vital for the overall well-being of individuals and communities. In conclusion, Health For All is indeed about health, but it is essential to recognize that it is a comprehensive and multi-faceted concept that encompasses more than just the mere absence of disease or infirmity. It emphasizes the importance of equitable access to healthcare, primary healthcare, intersectoral collaboration, community participation, sustainable development, and a holistic approach to health in realizing the goal of securing the health and well-being of all people around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It has been a while and I've had many good eats within the time that I've been away and now it's time to clean out my backlog of unfinished reviews so let's cut straight to the chase shall we?  One of the best places to eat in the UNLV area goes by the name of Yayo Taco. It is walking distance from the student union and everything they have to offer is affordable in terms of a college student's budget.  The venue is a pretty chill place. It definitely has that hole in the wall feel and there's no mistaking that this is a locals joint because it has that family feel to it when you're just hanging out. Yayo holds frequent events and they have local bands come out to play in the venue and they're always a blast but the best thing about this place is that they cater to the students.  Yayo is best known for having a student deal available not only to the students of UNLV, but to the students of CSN as well. This deal includes your choice of 2 sides, 4 tacos classicos, and a drink. There are quite a few sides but I like to get sweet potato fries and a side of nachos. They have a great variety of tacos and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the beer battered camarrones (shrimp) tacos. SOOOO GOOD.

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. David Monroe Shoup was born on 30 December 1904 in Battle Ground, Indiana. His family lived on a farm in Ash Grove, but moved to Covington to live on a new farm in 1916. At age 12 he was enrolled in Covington High School, a competitive high school with an advanced curriculum. Shoup was an excellent student, maintaining high marks in French, English, physics, and history. Additionally, he was involved in several extracurricular activities, including basketball, and was class president in his senior year. He graduated in 1921. He later affectionately referred to his impoverished upbringing as that of an \\"Indiana plowboy.\\" Regarded by friends as very sociable, he met Zola De Haven in his freshman year and later said he had been instantly attracted to her. They were both very competitive in academics and athletics, and the two dated throughout high school; they were married in 1931.  After high school, Shoup attended DePauw University where he was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.  From an early age, Shoup was molded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives fighting against the interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.","output":"This text is about David Monroe Shoup, a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps.

Conway indicated in the memo that the videos he provided showed “graphic evidence that Jian had caused physical injury to a woman.”      Sources have told the Star Ghomeshi presented graphic videos and photos of himself and a woman to his bosses, in an attempt to show “how bruising could happen and it could still be consensual.”      Ghomeshi believed the videos “were exculpatory of his conduct,” sources told the Star.      After learning about the videos from media reports, Beaven-Desjardins said police will be speaking to individuals at the CBC about both the videos and any knowledge they might have of the allegations against Ghomeshi.      CBC has “reached out to police and will fully cooperate with their investigation,” CBC spokesperson Chuck Thompson said Saturday afternoon.      Thompson would not respond to questions about whether CBC is in possession of the videos.      On Friday he told the Star he couldn’t comment for legal reasons when asked if the CBC had considered going to police after the meeting.      Earlier this week, the CBC said an independent investigation into allegations against Ghomeshi within the CBC and on improving workplace safety systems will be conducted.      The announcement came after one of the nine women, a CBC employee at the time, told the Star in an interview that Ghomeshi sexually harassed her in the workplace. And in a meeting to discuss her complaints with Q’s executive producer, she said she was asked “what (she) could do to make this a less toxic work environment.”      In a Facebook post on Thursday, Ghomeshi said that while he does not plan to address any allegations against him in the media, he does intend to meet them “directly.”      Ghomeshi wrote in a previous post that, while he has engaged in “adventurous forms of sex that included role-play, dominance and submission,” it has always been consensual. He reiterated, in a 55-million defamation and breach of trust lawsuit against CBC, that all his sexual interactions have been consensual.      A formal police investigation was launched Friday, a day after Chief Bill Blair made a public statement asking complainants to contact the police so an investigation could be opened.      But Beaven-Desjardins said that as soon as the media reports came out, she assigned officers to review all coverage so they could be prepared when a formal investigation commenced. She also contacted media outlets to pass police and Victim Services contact information on to their sources.      The police are now asking anyone with photos, videos and social media chats related to the investigation to contact the sex-crimes unit.      Beaven-Desjardins encouraged other alleged victims to come forward and assured them that their accounts would be taken seriously. ||||| Disgraced radio host Jian Ghomeshi’s agent, publisher and former bandmates are the latest people to distance themselves from him. In a brief statement on Friday, the Toronto-based company The Agency, which describes itself as “the world's leading live music booking agency,” announced that “they are no longer the agent of representation” for Ghomeshi.      The Agency is the latest in a string of people and groups to distance themselves from Jian Ghomeshi. ( JOHN WOODS / THE CANADIAN PRESS )      According to Ghomeshi’s website, he was represented by The Agency’s Jack Ross, who did not return phone and email requests. Late Friday, Penguin Random House Canada said it would not be publishing Ghomeshi’s next book “in light of recent events,” according to a statement from spokeswoman Tracey Turriff, who declined further comment. Members of Ghomeshi’s former band, Moxy Fruvous, who had not played since 2000, said in a Facebook statement that they were “sickened and saddened” by the allegations leveled against Ghomeshi.      Article Continued Below      “We had no inkling that Jian engaged in this type of behaviour. We abhor the idea of a sexual relationship of any sort being entered into without full consent from both parties and condemn violence against women in any form. We wish only health and healing to everyone involved,” said Mike Ford, Murray Foster and David Matheson. Musician Lights, who was managed by Ghomeshi announced on her Facebook page that, though she had earlier defended him, she had now parted ways with Ghomeshi. Her statement said “I posted comments about Jian Ghomeshi the day after he was dismissed by the CBC where I rushed to defend my manager of 12 years. I am now aware that my comments appear insensitive to those impacted and for that I am deeply sorry. This is to confirm that as of now I will be parting ways with Jian Ghomeshi as my manager.      I hope everyone can heal from this.” Ghomeshi was fired by the CBC on Sunday, and is suing the public broadcaster for 55 million. Nine women have so far alleged in the media that he choked them, pulled their hair, hit them over the head or sexually harassed them.      Article Continued Below      Ghomeshi has previously said his actions were consensual and that he intends to meet these allegations “directly.” Among the other groups to dump Ghomeshi since nine women made allegations of assault and sexual harassment against him include Navigator, the high-profile crisis management firm, his publicist rock-it Promotions, and two Canadian speakers bureaus. Sources have told the Star that Navigator dropped Ghomeshi because they believed he had lied to them about the extent of his encounters with women. In the meantime, more details are emerging about what Ghomeshi showed, including graphic video, the CBC in the days before he was fired.

It has been more than a year since allegations against the former CBC Radio host first surfaced. Ghomeshi has always denied any wrongdoing and claimed his sexual relations were consensual.      Here are some key dates in his case.      Oct. 24: CBC says Ghomeshi is taking an undetermined amount of time away from the network \\"to deal with some personal issues.\\" And Ghomeshi tweets:      \\"Thanks for all the well wishes, you guys. I'm OK. Just taking some much needed personal time.\\"      Oct. 26: CBC announces it has cut ties with the \\"Q\\" radio host after receiving \\"information\\" about him.      \\"The CBC is saddened to announce its relationship with Jian Ghomeshi has come to an end. This decision was not made without serious deliberation and careful consideration. Jian has made an immense contribution to the CBC and we wish him well.\\"      -CBC statement      Oct. 26: Ghomeshi issues a lengthy Facebook post saying he has engaged in rough sex, but says it was always consensual. He says he was fired from CBC because of the risk that his sex life would become public \\"as a result of a campaign of false allegations.\\"      “Dear everyone,            I am writing today because I want you to be the first to know some news.            This has been the hardest time of my life. I am reeling from the loss of my father. I am in deep personal pain and worried about my mom. And now my world has been rocked by so much more.            Today, I was fired from the CBC.            For almost 8 years I have been the host of a show I co-created on CBC called Q. It has been my pride and joy. My fantastic team on Q are super-talented and have helped build something beautiful.            I have always operated on the principle of doing my best to maintain a dignity and a commitment to openness and truth, both on and off the air. I have conducted major interviews, supported Canadian talent, and spoken out loudly in my audio essays about ideas, issues, and my love for this country. All of that is available for anyone to hear or watch. I have known, of course, that not everyone always agrees with my opinions or my style, but I’ve never been anything but honest. I have doggedly defended the CBC and embraced public broadcasting. This is a brand I’ve been honoured to help grow.            All this has now changed.            Today I was fired from the company where I’ve been working for almost 14 years – stripped from my show, barred from the building and separated from my colleagues. I was given the choice to walk away quietly and to publicly suggest that this was my decision. But I am not going to do that. Because that would be untrue. Because I’ve been fired. And because I’ve done nothing wrong.            I’ve been fired from the CBC because of the risk of my private sex life being made public as a result of a campaign of false allegations pursued by a jilted ex girlfriend and a freelance writer.            As friends and family of mine, you are owed the truth.            I have commenced legal proceedings against the CBC, what’s important to me is that you know what happened and why.            Forgive me if what follows may be shocking to some.            I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.            About two years ago I started seeing a woman in her late 20s. Our relationship was affectionate, casual and passionate. We saw each other on and off over the period of a year and began engaging in adventurous forms of sex that included role-play, dominance and submission. We discussed our interests at length before engaging in rough sex (forms of BDSM). We talked about using safe words and regularly checked in with each other about our comfort levels. She encouraged our role-play and often was the initiator. We joked about our relations being like a mild form of Fifty Shades of Grey or a story from Lynn Coady’s Giller-Prize winning book last year. I don’t wish to get into any more detail because it is truly not anyone’s business what two consenting adults do. I have never discussed my private life before. Sexual preferences are a human right.            Despite a strong connection between us it became clear to me that our on-and-off dating was unlikely to grow into a larger relationship and I ended things in the beginning of this year. She was upset by this and sent me messages indicating her disappointment that I would not commit to more, and her anger that I was seeing others.            After this, in the early spring there began a campaign of harassment, vengeance and demonization against me that would lead to months of anxiety.            It came to light that a woman had begun anonymously reaching out to people that I had dated (via Facebook) to tell them she had been a victim of abusive relations with me. In other words, someone was reframing what had been an ongoing consensual relationship as something nefarious. I learned – through one of my friends who got in contact with this person – that someone had rifled through my phone on one occasion and taken down the names of any woman I had seemed to have been dating in recent years. This person had begun methodically contacting them to try to build a story against me. Increasingly, female friends and ex-girlfriends of mine told me about these attempts to smear me.            Someone also began colluding with a freelance writer who was known not to be a fan of mine and, together, they set out to try to find corroborators to build a case to defame me. She found some sympathetic ears by painting herself as a victim and turned this into a campaign. The writer boldly started contacting my friends, acquaintances and even work colleagues – all of whom came to me to tell me this was happening and all of whom recognized it as a trumped up way to attack me and undermine my reputation. Everyone contacted would ask the same question, if I had engaged in non-consensual behavior why was the place to address this the media?            The writer tried to peddle the story and, at one point, a major Canadian media publication did due diligence but never printed a story. One assumes they recognized these attempts to recast my sexual behaviour were fabrications. Still, the spectre of mud being flung onto the Internet where online outrage can demonize someone before facts can refute false allegations has been what I’ve had to live with.            And this leads us to today and this moment. I’ve lived with the threat that this stuff would be thrown out there to defame me. And I would sue. But it would do the reputational damage to me it was intended to do (the ex has even tried to contact me to say that she now wishes to refute any of these categorically untrue allegations). But with me bringing it to light, in the coming days you will prospectively hear about how I engage in all kinds of unsavoury aggressive acts in the bedroom. And the implication may be made that this happens non-consensually. And that will be a lie. But it will be salacious gossip in a world driven by a hunger for “scandal”. And there will be those who choose to believe it and to hate me or to laugh at me. And there will be an attempt to pile on. And there will be the claim that there are a few women involved (those who colluded with my ex) in an attempt to show a “pattern of behaviour”. And it will be based in lies but damage will be done. But I am telling you this story in the hopes that the truth will, finally, conquer all.            I have been open with the CBC about this since these categorically untrue allegations ramped up. I have never believed it was anyone’s business what I do in my private affairs but I wanted my bosses to be aware that this attempt to smear me was out there. CBC has been part of the team of friends and lawyers assembled to deal with this for months. On Thursday I voluntarily showed evidence that everything I have done has been consensual. I did this in good faith and because I know, as I have always known, that I have nothing to hide. This when the CBC decided to fire me.            CBC execs confirmed that the information provided showed that there was consent. In fact, they later said to me and my team that there is no question in their minds that there has always been consent. They said they’re not concerned about the legal side. But then they said that this type of sexual behavior was unbecoming of a prominent host on the CBC. They said that I was being dismissed for “the risk of the perception that may come from a story that could come out.” To recap, I am being fired in my prime from the show I love and built and threw myself into for years because of what I do in my private life.            Let me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks. They may be strange, enticing, weird, normal, or outright offensive to others. We all have our secret life. But that is my private life. That is my personal life. And no one, and certainly no employer, should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life.            And so, with no formal allegations, no formal complaints, no complaints, not one, to the HR department at the CBC (they told us they’d done a thorough check and were satisfied), and no charges, I have lost my job based on a campaign of vengeance. Two weeks after the death of my beautiful father I have been fired from the CBC because of what I do in my private life.            I have loved the CBC. The Q team are the best group of people in the land. My colleagues and producers and on-air talent at the CBC are unparalleled in being some of the best in the business. I have always tried to be a good soldier and do a good job for my country. I am still in shock. But I am telling this story to you so the truth is heard. And to bring an end to the nightmare.\\"      -Jian Ghomeshi Facebook post      Oct. 27: The Toronto Star publishes a report detailing allegations from three women who say Ghomeshi was physically violent to them without their consent during sexual encounters or in the run-up to such encounters.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What is something that you eat that has a heel?

A:","output":"\\"Loaf of bread\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it relates to the most appropriate context of the question. When taking into account what items are typically consumed by humans, it is evident that \\"foot,\\" \\"sandal,\\" \\"shoe,\\" and \\"boot\\" are not regular choices of edible items. On the contrary, a loaf of bread is a common food item that is consumed by humans as a staple in many diets across various cultures. The term \\"heel\\" in the context of the question refers to the end slice of a loaf of bread. The heel is typically crustier than the other slices and could be seen as less desirable to some individuals due to its texture. However, it is still an edible part of the loaf, meeting the criteria of \\"something that you eat.\\" Consequently, a loaf of bread aligns with human common sense in the perspective of consumable products. To better understand the relevance of each possible answer, let's delve into why the other options are not in line with human common sense: 1. Foot: A human foot is a body part and not a food-related item. While some animals may have edible feet (like chicken), it is not commonly eaten as a regular food item by humans. 2. Sandal: Sandals are a type of footwear designed for human use. They are made of materials such as leather, rubber, or fabric that are not edible, making them an unsuitable answer to the question. 3. Shoe: Similar to sandals, shoes are also a type of footwear designed to protect and comfort human feet during various activities. They are made of non-edible materials and not considered a food item. 4. Boot: Another form of footwear, boots are made from inedible materials such as leather, rubber, or synthetic fabrics. They're designed to protect and support feet during different types of activities like hiking or work, but they're not meant to be eaten. In conclusion, \\"loaf of bread\\" stands as an answer that aligns with human common sense given its appropriateness to the context of the question. The question revolves around the consumption of something with a heel, and thus, the loaf of bread's heel serves as a fitting representation of an edible item with this attribute. The remaining options involve non-food items or body parts, which do not qualify as common-sense responses in terms of items meant for human consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

UPDATE 4-Turkish PM makes last-ditch call for unity as govt deadline looms * Davutoglu urges parties to unite before Sunday deadline * Calls for agreement on a working government * Erdogan could call for power-sharing government * Lira hits record low of 3 to the dollar ANKARA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu made a last-ditch call for Turkey's political parties to agree a working government on Thursday, three days before a deadline that would otherwise see President Tayyip Erdogan call a snap election. Davutoglu formally gave up efforts to find a junior coalition partner for his ruling AK Party on Tuesday, more than two months after it lost its overall majority for the first time since coming to power in 2002. Turkey's politicians have until Aug. 23 to agree a working government or else Erdogan could call for an interim, power-sharing cabinet to lead the country to a new election, which would be expected to be held in November. That would prolong uncertainty which has sent the lira to a series of record lows. Investors have already been unnerved by rising violence in the mostly Kurdish southeast and by Turkey's growing role in the conflict in neighbouring Syria. In overnight trade, the currency briefly weakened below the psychological barrier of 3 to the dollar for the first time . It spent much of the trading day down more than 1 percent before recovering losses. \\"I am ready to sit down and talk any time, as long as we find a solution in parliament. The possibility of a coalition is no longer available so instead of blaming each other, let's form a government,\\" Davutoglu told a news conference in Ankara. \\"If that first option fails, and the president calls for a snap election, I urge all political parties to take part in this election government in line with the spirit of ... the constitution,\\" he said. An interim \\"election government\\" would see power shared between four political parties with deep ideological divides, a scenario likely to lead to stagnation in policy making. Forming such a cabinet is in any case uncertain as two parties, the secularist CHP and the nationalist MHP, have said they would not take part. Parliament could theoretically vote to back Davutoglu's current caretaker cabinet staying in office for now, but opposition parties have little incentive to do so and either way an early election is all but inevitable. In a note to political parties, the election commission proposed that any new election should be held on Nov. 1, AKP officials said. \\"Parties put forward their own views on the proposed date and after that an agreement will be sought. Nov. 1 and Nov. 22 are suitable for us,\\" one senior AKP official told Reuters. The prospect of another election has failed to assuage market worries about the 870 billion economy, not least because there is no guarantee that a re-run will produce anything other than another inconclusive outcome. \\"A coalition would have been good for investor confidence, but now we have more uncertainty and I don't think the result will change with new elections,\\" said Vedat Mizrahi, a managing director at financial services firm Unlu & Co. \\"It is really tough right now. There is almost no foreign institutional investor interest in Turkey.\\" The lira is now down over 20 percent against the dollar this year, making it one of the worst performing currencies among its emerging market peers. \\"We're getting poorer by the day,\\" said elementary school teacher Nevin, 44, shopping for groceries at a supermarket in central Ankara. \\"Now they're going to knock on our doors and ask for our votes? How dare they? Shameless politicians.\\" Erdogan, who founded the Islamist-rooted AKP, could still in theory ask the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to try to form a government. But the CHP has shown little sign of being able to assemble a majority, and Erdogan told a meeting of village administrators on Wednesday that he would not \\"waste time\\" with those who did not know the address of the presidential palace, an apparent reference to the head of the CHP. The crisis has coincided with rising insecurity, as Turkey's military jets pound Kurdish militant positions in southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq in response to attacks on the security forces, and as it opens its air bases for U.S.-led coalition air strikes on Islamic State insurgents in Syria. Investors looking to the central bank for an independent steadying hand have, so far, been disappointed. The bank declined to raise interest rates at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday, in what investors saw as acquiescence to political pressure from Erdogan. \\"The (central bank) is in 'rabbit in the headlights' mode again,\\" said Tim Ash, credit strategist at Nomura. \\"You have central bank independence for a reason - Turkey does not have enough of it these days.\\" Some investors are starting to think, however, that the lira's persistent slide could force an emergency rate hike. \\"In the end they will have to hike even more aggressively to stop the bleeding in the lira,\\" said Unlu's Mizrahi. (Additional reporting by Daren Butler in Istanbul and Ece Toksabay in Ankara; Writing by David Dolan and Nick Tattersall; Editing by Mark Trevelyan) What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Turkey's PM, Ahmet Davutoglu, has issued a final call for the country's political parties to form a unity government before next Sunday's deadline, as the country's currency, the lira, hits a record low against the dollar. If the government does not receive coalition support, Erdogan could call for an interim, power-sharing government, leading the country up to a November election. More uncertainty could be worrying for investors, given violence in the Kurdish-dominated southeast of Turkey, coupled with the nation's growing role in the Syria conflict."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This conclusion, from a new study of nearly 4,000 children, will be presented Friday at the Endocrine Society's 98th annual meeting in Boston.      In the U.S., 17 percent of children and teens are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, health care providers do not know when obese children develop an abnormal pattern of weight gain, said lead investigator Allison Smego, MD, a pediatric endocrinology fellow at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.      \\"Our study shows that growth patterns in children who become severely obese by 6 years of age differ from normal-weight children as young as 4 to 6 months of age,\\" Smego said.      The researchers found that a high BMI, measured between 6 and 18 months of age, accurately predicted which infants were prone to early-childhood obesity.      Children age 2 years or older are considered overweight if they have a BMI at or above the 85th percentile for their age and sex on standard growth charts, and are obese if their BMI is at the 95th percentile or higher. Although not typically done, infants' BMI can be tracked on World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts for birth to 24 months.      In this study, Smego and colleagues looked at the electronic health records for two groups of patients who had growth data from birth through age 6 years. One group of 480 children was severely obese between ages 2 and 6 years, with a BMI above the 99th percentile on the WHO growth charts, and the other group of 783 kids was lean, with a BMI between the 5th and 75th percentiles during those ages. Looking back at the growth curves over time, the researchers found that BMI diverged between the two groups starting at only 4 months of age.      A BMI above the 85th percentile at 6, 12, or 18 months was a strong predictor of severe obesity by the age of 6 years, the investigators reported.      Most of the obese children were from low-income, African-American populations in Cincinnati, according to Smego. To validate their findings in a different ethnic and socioeconomic population, the researchers repeated the study in a third group: 2,649 children seen at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo., which had a higher Hispanic population. Smego said that a BMI threshold above the 85th percentile increased the chance of severe obesity at age 6 years by threefold to nine-fold in this group.      \\"Based on our findings, we recommend that pediatricians routinely measure BMI at infant well-child assessments beginning at 6 months, identify high-risk infants with BMI above the 85th percentile, and focus additional counseling and education regarding healthy lifestyle toward the families of these children,\\" Smego said. \\"It might take the pediatrician a minute to look at BMI, yet it gives them a wealth of knowledge about how their patient is growing.\\"      #      Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? For example, if you do not have a lot of currency, buy a weak kit such as chainmail or gold or leather. If you have more currency, you could buy something more powerful such as iron or even diamond. Not all maps have kits, but if yours does, it is better to go in with a kit than with nothing at all. If you play the map multiple times, you will memorize it and know where the good loot is, like studying for a big exam. As soon as the game starts, decide how you want to get your initial loot. A lot of players will attempt to loot the Cornucopia at the start of the round. Decide if you want to risk the crowd and score some loot, or immediately run off and hide.  Don't immediately equip anything good that you find. This will make you a quick target for other players who want what you have. Save your equipment for important fights later. If you decide to head straight for the Cornucopia at the start of the round, grab as much as you can and then immediately run away. The Cornucopia will soon turn into a slaughter, and you probably don't want to be around for that. Most maps have chests scattered around that can provide a lot of helpful items. If you know where these chests are located, make a beeline to them. Not only will this help you get good items, but you can set up an ambush at the chest for other players. Food is essential for staving off hunger, which has a direct effect on your stamina. Try to hoard some food so you can survive while hiding and keep your health up. Although there can be only one survivor, you might last longer if you team up with someone. This can be mutually beneficial and can improve both of your chances at survival. It's much easier to win fights if you're working with someone else.  Make sure your teammate does not have more powerful items than you; this way you can kill them and they cannot kill you easily, but give them a little bit so they do not know what you are planning. At some point, you're going to have to turn against your teammate. Make sure to always keep an eye on the other person, in case he or she decides to strike first. Many times, offers to team up will just be traps. Be very wary when invited to join up with someone else. A good time to sadly kill your teammate is before the deathmatch or if they try to kill you. After killing someone, make sure to take most of everything they were carrying. They may have powerful equipment that can help you out, or they may have healing items that can help prolong your life. Above all else, taking your dead opponent's items keeps those items from falling into another player's hands. If you have lots of materials, you can try to craft some better items. These can give you an edge in battle, but crafting can be dangerous. Make sure that you're in the clear before you start crafting, or you might find yourself dead with your menus still open.

If taking a bath in regular tap water isn’t helping reduce the itchy symptoms of your eczema, try adding Epsom salts to the water. You can also try adding Himalayan salt instead of Epsom. Add a generous amount of salt—about 1⁄2 cup (120 mL). Then, take a 30-minute bath. Then dip down in the bath so that your face is underwater. This will allow salt onto your facial eczema.  Or, if you dislike the feeling of your face being underwater, try splashing a few generous handfuls of salty bath water on your face. If salt doesn’t help, try adding 10 drops of an essential bath oil like lavender or chamomile. Tea tree oil is a great natural way to reduce symptoms of burning or itching sensations. While tea tree oil won’t treat or remove the eczema itself, it can provide temporary relief from discomfort.  You can purchase vials of tea tree oil from most natural foods stores or the organic section in large supermarkets. Tea tree oil is sometimes sold in a spritz bottle, making it easy to apply to a patch of skin. Vitamin E can also provide relief from the uncomfortable symptoms of mild eczema. Visit a natural foods store, and look for vitamin E that contains natural D-alpha tocopherol. Dab a small amount of the oil on your finger, and smear it over the part of your face with eczema. Do not apply synthetic vitamin E oil to your face, as it may contain ingredients which worsen the condition of your eczema.","output":"To alleviate eczema symptoms, try adding Epsom or Himalayan salts to bathwater, using essential oils like lavender, chamomile or tea tree oil, or applying natural vitamin E oil containing D-alpha tocopherol."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"Beavers build dams.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would find the sentence \\"Beavers build dams.\\" to be acceptable linguistically for several reasons. This sentence adheres to the basic principles of well-formedness in linguistic theory, and it is also an appropriate use of language from a communicative standpoint. From a syntactic perspective, this sentence reflects the necessary structure of a subject, verb, and object (SVO), which is the standard word order for a declarative sentence in English. In this sentence: 1. The subject is 'Beavers' which is a plural noun acting as the agent or the 'doer' of the action. 2. The verb is 'build', which is an action verb describing the activity performed by the subject. 3. The object is 'dams', which is another plural noun and receives the action of the verb, indicating what the beavers build. This sentence is simple, clear, and concise, conforming to the rules of English grammar. Apart from syntactic well-formedness, it also follows the rules of morphology. The plural form of both 'beaver' and 'dam' is correctly marked by the addition of 's', and the verb 'build' is in its base form, which is appropriate for a plural subject. From a semantic viewpoint, this sentence conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity, providing information about the activity beavers are known for. Each word contributes to the intended meaning of the sentence, and there is no extraneous or contradictory information. Pragmatically speaking, this sentence would be considered acceptable and appropriate for a wide range of communicative contexts.

Hypothesis: The Japanese WW II rocket powered aircraft name means Sharp Sword.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the Japanese WW II rocket-powered aircraft name means Sharp Sword from the given context. The Mitsubishi J8M \\"Shūsui\\" derives its name from a poetic term, which translates to \\"Autumn Water.\\" In the context provided, the term \\"Autumn Water\\" is used to signify \\"Sharp Sword.\\" The name was likely chosen because of the swishing sound of a sword, which is reminiscent of the sound made by swiftly cutting through air or water. The context also provides interesting information about the origins of the aircraft, stating that it was closely based on the German Messerschmitt Me 163 \\"Komet.\\" This implies that during the period of World War II, the Japanese may have been inspired by German technology and sought to create a similar aircraft as part of their defense arsenal. The Mitsubishi J8M \\"Shūsui,\\" as a rocket-powered interceptor aircraft, played a crucial role in aerial combat during World War II. Aircraft such as these were designed to rapidly climb and intercept enemy bomber aircraft, with the ultimate goal of shooting them down before they could reach their targets and inflict damage. However, it is essential to note that merely drawing a hypothesis out of the given context does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is confirmed beyond doubt. It highlights a potential conclusion based on the information provided. To make the hypothesis more robust, further research and evidence should be gathered. For example, verifying the translation of the name \\"Shūsui\\" (Autumn Water) to ensure its poetic meaning signifies Sharp Sword. Additionally, exploring primary sources and historical documents that shed light on the development and naming of the Mitsubishi J8M might help establish a concrete argument supporting the hypothesis. Nevertheless, based on the context given, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the Japanese WW II rocket-powered aircraft's name means Sharp Sword."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution.

Background: Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Persian: syd rwHllh mwswy khmyny [ru:hol'la:he khomei'ni:] ( listen); 24 September 1902 - 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader and politician. He was the founder of Iran as an Islamic republic and the leader of its 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of 2500 years of Persian monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. Context: In January 1963, the Shah announced the \\"White Revolution\\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \\"an attack on Islam\\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.  Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.  On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man,\\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.  On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August. Question: What was the other points?. Whats the answer?","output":"The White Revolution, announced by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in January 1963, was a six-point program aimed at modernizing Iran and addressing socio-economic issues. The main points of the White Revolution included: 1. Land reform: The government aimed to redistribute land, breaking the monopoly and control of a few large landowners. It sought to provide ownership opportunities to small farmers and landless peasants, ensuring them a fair share of agricultural production and improving their living standards. 2. Nationalization of forests: This measure involved transferring the ownership of forests from private hands to the state. The purpose was to ensure proper management, conservation, and development of the forest resources and to establish better practices in the utilization of forest products. 3. Sale of state-owned enterprises: This point of the reform aimed at privatizing some of the state-owned enterprises, allowing for increased private investment, competition, and efficiency within the Iranian economy. 4. Electoral changes: The Shah called for electoral reforms that would enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office. It aimed to promote inclusiveness in the political system andabolish the gender-based restrictions in voting and civic participation. 5. Profit-sharing in industry: The government proposed introducing a profit-sharing system in industries. Such a system would provide employees with a share of the company's profits, motivating them and leading to greater productivity and economic growth. 6. Literacy campaign: The government aimed to address the problem of illiteracy in Iran by introducing a national literacy campaign targeting the nation's schools. The objective was to improve educational opportunities and literacy rates within the population. Ayatollah Khomeini and other Shia religious scholars were strongly against some of these reforms, viewing them as \\"an attack on Islam\\" and signs of Westernization that threatened traditional values. Khomeini's opposition to the Shah's programs escalated tensions between the Shah and the ulama, culminating in Khomeini's arrest and the ensuing Movement of 15 Khordad."},{"instruction":"Q:Bob was studying about Earth's atmosphere.

The sentence expresses dissatisfaction or criticism towards the unmemorable aspects of the dialogue scenes that the writer is referencing. Specifically, it highlights that even after several attempts of augmenting the dialogue, the desired level of impact has not been achieved. In fact, the use of words and phrases such as \\"unmemorable\\" and \\"despite several attempts\\" conveys the idea that the dialogue scenes have failed to create the intended mental or emotional impression on the audience or readers. This suggests that the writer is unimpressed by the quality or substance of the dialogue scenes, perhaps referencing their lack of captivating information or the poor crafting of the dialogue itself. Moreover, the phrase \\"lengthy dialogue scenes\\" could imply that these scenes might have been expanded or drawn out, possibly leading to tediousness or boredom for the audience or readers. The sentiment, however, does not specify whether it is the length of the dialogue that contributes to its unmemorable nature or if it's just the general quality of the dialogue itself. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence would be perceived as negative, with the writer expressing disappointment or critique of the dialogue scenes in question. The unmemorable nature of these scenes and the failed attempts to improve their impact indicate that the writer finds them unengaging and lackluster, which may leave a similar impression on the targeted audience or readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The tragedy occurred during the early hours of Saturday, February 13, 2016, near Stockholm. The band was returning from their first ever international gig, and their future seemed incredibly bright. Fans, fellow musicians, and the indie music scene in both the UK and globally were left heartbroken and in shock. Viola Beach: Their Story Viola Beach, named after the lead vocalist and guitarist's hometown, first emerged on the indie music scene in 2013. Hailing from Warrington, the unsigned band had already gained recognition in their own right, receiving airtime on various radio stations and being championed by BBC Introducing, which showcases up-and-coming music acts. The band consisted of four young and talented musicians: 19-year-old Kris Leonard (guitar and vocals), 20-year-old River Reeves (guitar), 27-year-old Tomas Lowe (bass), and 18-year-old Jack Dakin (drums). Their manager, Craig Tarry (32), was not only a passionate advocate for the band but an integral part of their ascent in the British indie scene. The Accident in Sweden The night of the tragedy, Viola Beach had played at a music festival called \\"Where's the Music?\\" held in Norrköping, Sweden. The event marked their first international show, a major stepping stone for any upcoming band. Excitement and anticipation filled the atmosphere, as the band performed with energy and enthusiasm that captivated the crowd. Little did anyone know that this performance would sadly be their last. As they were driving towards the capital city of Stockholm after the show, a tragic accident unfolded that claimed their lives on Södertäljevägen road. The band's car, a Nissan Qashqai, crashed through a barrier and plunged more than 80 feet off a bridge into a canal. The vehicle was reportedly traveling at high speeds when it collided with the bridge’s beams, killing all its passengers instantly. The exact circumstances surrounding the accident remain unclear. Investigations were conducted by the Swedish police to determine its cause. Initial reports suggested that warning lights and signals were working correctly; however, other subsequent findings implied that there might have been an issue with the signals. The music community continues to mourn the loss of these talented lives. Response from the Music Industry and Fans The tragic news of Viola Beach's accident sent shockwaves through the music industry. Fellow musicians expressed their condolences and shared messages of solidarity on social media. Many high-profile bands and artists, including The Coral, Liam Gallagher from Oasis, and The Kooks, paid tribute to Viola Beach by performing covers of the band's songs with a heartfelt dedication. Fans were also quick to show their love and support for Viola Beach and their families, with tributes and memorials occurring worldwide. Social media was flooded with messages, artwork, and memories of the band. As a way to commemorate and honor their sudden departure, fans quickly began a campaign to get the band's single \\"Swings and Waterslides\\" to the top of the music charts. The single climbed to the top of the iTunes and Spotify charts in the UK, serving as a powerful and emotional reminder of the band's budding potential that was tragically cut short. Legacy and What Could Have Been Viola Beach's journey was one marked by unbridled passion, talent, and dedication. Their music was filled with contagious energy, the kind that leaves a lasting impression on its listeners. In their short career, they managed to captivate not only their loyal fan base but the music industry as a whole. The terrible accident that took the lives of the entire band and their manager still leaves us wondering what could have been. With their talent and potential, they were poised for greatness, and their dreams were just beginning to take root. However, their music and spirit will endure, as will the memories and love shared by fans and their community. As we remember Viola Beach, we are reminded of the courage and vulnerability it takes to chase one's passion in the face of adversity. Their legacy will serve as an inspiration to aspiring musicians and a stark testament to the unpredictable fragility of life.

This event was live-streamed, allowing millions of people worldwide to watch the unveiling of the iPhone 7 in real-time. The iPhone 7 came out alongside the iPhone 7 Plus, and these devices replaced the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as Apple's flagship smartphones. Pre-orders for the iPhone 7 in the United States began on September 9, 2016, and the initial release in the US, along with 28 other countries, occurred on September 16, 2016. Later in September, the iPhone 7 became available in even more countries. The iPhone 7 introduced several significant improvements over its predecessors, including a new A10 Fusion processor, increased battery life, an improved water and dust resistance rating (IP67), and the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The iPhone 7 Plus introduced a dual-camera system, which enabled 2x optical zoom and a new Portrait mode that could capture images with a depth-of-field effect (also called \\"bokeh\\"). Moreover, the iPhone 7 came equipped with a new pressure-sensitive home button, using Apple's Taptic Engine technology for haptic feedback. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were available in different storage capacities: 32 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB. They were initially offered in five colors: Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Black, and Jet Black. Later on, a (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition was launched, with sales contributing to the Global Fund to support HIV/AIDS programs and help deliver an AIDS-free generation.

Process:  - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is at high altitude happens, how will it affect \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of being at high altitude does have a direct effect on the process of oxygen reaching the body's cells. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which means that there is less oxygen available in the air for the body to take in. This situation can lead to a condition known as hypoxia, where there is insufficient oxygen to meet the body's needs. Here's the detailed impact on the process: 1. Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose: At high altitudes, the air is thinner and contains less oxygen. When a person breathes in, they will inhale a lower concentration of oxygen as compared to sea level. This reduces the amount of oxygen available for the body. 2. The oxygen travels into the lungs: The lower oxygen levels in the air lead to lower partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs. This creates a smaller driving force for oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli (small air sacs in the lungs) into the bloodstream. 3. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): With lower oxygen partial pressure, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is reduced. As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the erythrocytes is diminished, leading to lower levels of oxygenated blood. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: The heart will need to pump faster and harder to deliver the required oxygen to the body's tissues, as the amount of oxygen in each erythrocyte is less than at lower altitudes. This increased demand for oxygen supply might result in a higher heart rate. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: Due to the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and increased demand, cells in the body may not receive an adequate amount of oxygen. This can limit the cellular function and impair various bodily processes, leading to symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. To adapt to high altitudes, the body undergoes various physiological changes, such as increased production of erythrocytes and the release of certain hormones that help to improve oxygen transport. However, depending on the degree of altitude and duration of exposure, these adaptations may not be sufficient, and individuals may still experience the effects of hypoxia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thriller is the sixth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released on November 30, 1982, in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It explores genres similar to Jackson's previous album, Off the Wall (1979), including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of 750,000. In just over a year, Thriller became the world's best-selling album, having sold an estimated 66 million copies. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States, behind the Eagles' album Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975), and was the first to reach 30x platinum, with 33 million shipped album-equivalent units certified in the US. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year. It produced seven singles—\\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' \\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", and \\"Thriller\\"—all of which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Thriller broke racial barriers in pop music, enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs \\"Thriller\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Beat It\\" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition reissue was released, which contains additional audio interviews, demo recordings and the song \\"Someone in the Dark\\", a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, Thriller was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing remixes with contemporary artists, previously unreleased songs, and a DVD with three music videos and Jackson's performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" from the 1983 television special Motown 25.

Since 1998, the band's constant members have been vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist and vocalist Benji Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin, while drummer Dean Butterworth has been a member of the band since 2005. After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band has released six studio albums: Good Charlotte (2000), The Young and the Hopeless (2002), The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004), Good Morning Revival (2007), Cardiology (2010) and Youth Authority (2016), as well as two compilations: Greatest Remixes (2008) and Greatest Hits (2010). Good Charlotte's fifth album, with the help of former Dear Christie lead singer Adam Markin, was released on November 2, 2010. The album, which was released nearly 6 weeks later than anticipated due to Markin's constant battle with HPV, was an immediate success. Describing the sound to MTV news, Joel Madden said it would sound a lot like Blink-182. Joel Madden went on to say in the same MTV interview that \\"There's nothing dance-y on the record, though, at all, which is different from our last one,\\" further implying a movement away from the sound of Good Morning Revival. On December 3, 2008 Kerrang! magazine announced that Good Charlotte would be releasing its fifth studio album, Cardiology in 2009. The title of which, according to Joel, comes from the lyrical content of the album, which he explained is \\"all connected to the heart\\". Madden also added that the band had already written 20 songs for the new album, and are said to be heading back to their pop-punk roots. On January 24, 2010 Good Charlotte announced that the band had finished the album, but were going to completely scrap it and record with a different producer, Don Gilmore, who also produced the band's first and fourth records, Good Charlotte and Good Morning Revival.  The band released its first single \\"Like It's Her Birthday\\" featuring Tonight Alive from the new album on August 24, 2010. The band posted the song online August 5, 2010, and wrote on its website that if the video of the song received more than 100,000 views, the band would post another song from the album. The video reached 100,000 views on August 15, 2010 and the band released \\"Counting the Days\\" as a video on its YouTube channel and announced that it will be the second single from the album. The music video for \\"Like It's Her Birthday\\" has cameos from The Maine's lead singer John O'Callaghan and guitarist Kennedy Brock and Boys Like Girls' lead singer Martin Johnson, and guitarist Paul DiGiovanni.  On November 5, 2010, Good Charlotte's former label, Sony Music, released a Greatest Hits compilation for Australia, spanning 16 singles from the band's four studio albums released on that label. The compilation was later released in the US on January 6, 2011, and in Japan on February 16, 2011.  On September 13, 2010, it was announced that Good Charlotte will be headlining the 2011 Kerrang! Relentless Tour, with supporting acts Four Year Strong, Framing Hanley, and The Wonder Years.

However, it is not a direct consequence of attending a party with the opposite sex, as people may choose not to drink or to drink in moderation. 2. \\"Meet new people\\" - This is a more likely outcome of attending a party with the opposite sex, as socializing and getting to know others is a common purpose of attending parties. However, meeting new people may not necessarily lead to any specific outcome. 3. \\"Drinking beer\\" - This option is similar to the first one. While party-goers may choose to drink beer, it is not a direct consequence of attending with the opposite sex. 4. \\"Enjoy yourself\\" - Having fun and enjoying oneself is typically a goal of attending a party. This outcome is not dependent on the sex of your party companion, so it seems like an unlikely choice as the \\"correct\\" answer in this context. 5. \\"Having sex\\" - Attending a party with the opposite sex can potentially lead to sexual encounters, but it is not an inevitable outcome. It depends on the individuals involved and the choices they make during their interaction. Thus, considering all the options, if I were to choose the most appropriate answer in this context, I would go with \\"meet new people\\" because it is a common purpose of attending parties and a natural outcome of interacting with the opposite sex.

When King Frederick II was crowned in 1559, he immediately began expanding the navy. The number of bases, yards and vessels rose rapidly and substantial resources were used for new ship designs, weaponry, training and battle tactics. Sweden, which had become an independent country, dominated a large part of the Baltic Sea and threatened Danish merchant interests. In retaliation, Denmark closed the Øresund in 1568, laying the first seeds for the Scanian War , only eight years after the end of the second Nordic War , during which Denmark lost the now Swedish provinces of Skåne, Halland and Blekinge. During this period, further resources were allocated to the navy. Cort Adeler and Niels Juel led the Danish navy to a victory in the Battle of Køge Bay in 1677. King Christian IV  continued in his father's footsteps. In the beginning of the 17th century, he considerably expanded the naval workships. In Copenhagen, where the navy resided, he built a large number of homes for crewmembers and workshop craftsmen — the most famous being Nyboder  which still stands in central Copenhagen. General admiral lieutenant Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve was appointed supreme commander of the navy in 1701. He raised the status of the naval profession and established Søkadetakademie, the predecessor of the Royal Danish Naval Academy. In 1709, Peter Jansen Wessel joined the navy. He was later given the rank of admiral as a reward for his many victories - most famously at Marstrand and Dynekilden. He was later known as Tordenskjold.

Article: The financial crisis is reminding Americans of a lesson they first learned in childhood: Share and share alike. They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically   in communities across the Washington region and the nation.

One of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the City Council would shift 25.6 million from funding for court-appointed lawyers to the Legal Aid Society.

The Council document also noted that \\"inexplicably\\" 18-B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City, even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict.

The answer to the question: What was the last name of the candidate that lost their bid for President? is inside the article: Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

It’s not uncommon to see a dog owner—plastic bag in hand—rolling his eyes as his furry companion sniffs and spins, getting just so before hunkering down to do the least considerate thing possible.      But for whatever its worth, all that spinning is far from arbitrary. What dog owners witness is a small and furry version of the aurora borealis and a link between species and environment that’s as holistic and beautiful as a dog pooping can be. A team of Czech and German researchers found that dogs actually align themselves with the Earth’s magnetic field when they poop.      Proving at least that they’re really devoted to their work, the researchers measured the direction of the body axis of 70 dogs from 37 breeds during 1,893 defecations and 5,582 urinations over the course of two years, and found that dogs “prefer to excrete with the body being aligned along the North-south axis under calm magnetic field conditions.” They fittingly published their results in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.      You might wonder why dogs bother to do this, and uh, so do the researchers.      It is still enigmatic why the dogs do align at all, whether they do it ‘consciously’ (i.e., whether the magnetic field is sensorial perceived (the dogs ‘see,’ ‘hear’ or ‘smell’ the compass direction or perceive it as a haptic stimulus) or whether its reception is controlled on the vegetative level (they ‘feel better/more comfortable or worse/less comfortable’ in a certain direction). Our analysis of the raw data (not shown here) indicates that dogs not only prefer N-S direction, but at the same time they also avoid E-W direction.      This isn’t the only example of animals seemingly sensing the Earth’s magnetic field. Birds, turtles, and fish are known to use magnetic guidance while migrating. Cattle and deer are known to graze on a north-south axis—as with defecating dogs, this is magnetic north, not the geographic one. Some bats navigate using a magnetic compass and given the large ranges of the dog’s closest relatives in the wild, wolves, scientists suspected that canines might also sense the magnetic field.      But this was perhaps the first time that magnetic sensitivity was proven in dogs, and it was also the first time that a predictable behavioral reaction to the fluctuations in the magnetic field—magnetic storms, often as resulting from solar flares—was proven in a mammal.      If you’re out walking your dog later, and he sidles up and pees on a tree facing east-west, don’t be terribly surprised. The magnetic consciousness was observed only in dogs off leash, in the middle of a field. All things considered, the owner matters more to the dog than the Earth’s magnetic field; a nice little ego-booster that you’ll need as you bend over to pick up warm dog droppings. ||||| Dogs have been found to be sensitive to Earth's magnetic field, and apparently align themselves along the magnetic north-south axis before they defecate.      Czech and German researchers studied 70 dogs during 1,893 defecations and 5,582 urinations over the course of two years, and found that when the Earth's magnetic field was stable the dogs chose to align themselves with it. When it was unstable, such as during a solar flare, the dogs would become confused.      Their findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology, show that the dogs were sensitive to the polarity of the field, though not as much to its intensity.      Dogs on leashes, however, do not consistently align themselves as such, mainly doing so when they are free to choose. Researchers are yet to figure out why dogs exhibit this preference.      Other animals have been found to exhibit similar behavior. Many of the scientists who worked on this study had previously researched similar behavior seen in common carps. They found that the common carp also used geomagnetic lines to align themselves in a north-south direction. The results of this study were published in PLOS ONE.

Background: Dennis Coles (born May 9, 1970), better known by his stage name Ghostface Killah, is an American rapper and member of the Wu-Tang Clan. After the group achieved breakthrough success in the aftermath of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), the members went on to pursue solo careers to varying levels of success. Ghostface Killah debuted his solo-career with Ironman in 1996, which was well received by music critics. He has continued his success over the following years with critically acclaimed albums such as Supreme Clientele (2000) and Fishscale (2006). Context: Ghostface released a collaborative album with D-Block member Sheek Louch called Wu Block. The album was released on November 27, 2012, on E1 Music and debuted at number 73 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 8,600 copies in the United States. It fell to #152 in its second week selling 4,200 more copies.  In an interview with Complex Magazine on November 17, 2012, Ghostface Killah confirmed that he has left Def Jam, making Apollo Kids his last album on the label. In the same interview he also stated that Blue & Cream, the sequel to his critically acclaimed album Supreme Clientele, is 80-85 percent done. On April 16, 2013, Ghostface released his tenth album Twelve Reasons to Die which was produced by Adrian Younge and executive produced by RZA. The album was released in various formats such as CD, vinyl and cassette under RZA's Soul Temple Records. The deluxe digital and CD versions also come with a comic book.  He would later announce that the sequel to Supreme Clientele would be released between July and September 2013 and that his collaborative album with MF Doom would be released around Halloween 2013 though neither projects materialized. In January 2014, he appeared on the VH1 series Couples Therapy with his girlfriend Kelsey Nykole. Later that year Ghostface announced he would be releasing his eleventh album titled 36 Seasons in December 2014. He collaborated with Canadian jazz band BADBADNOTGOOD on an album titled Sour Soul which was released in 2015.  A sequel to Twelve Reasons to Die, simply titled Twelve Reasons to Die II, was released on July 10, 2015.  Ghostface had a string of UK and European tour dates scheduled in 2016 but no word on an upcoming album has been announced. Question: What is an interesting detail about his Post Jam career? Answer:","output":"An interesting detail about Ghostface Killah's post-Def Jam career is his penchant for collaboration and exploring different genres. After leaving the label, he not only continued working on solo projects, but also engaged in unique partnerships, such as with D-Block member Sheek Louch on the Wu Block album, and Canadian jazz band BADBADNOTGOOD on the Sour Soul album. These collaborations allowed him to expand his musical range and showcase his versatility. Furthermore, Ghostface's involvement in multimedia projects, such as the inclusion of a comic book with the deluxe digital and CD versions of Twelve Reasons to Die, demonstrates his interest in merging various artistic forms to create unique and comprehensive works. This willingness to experiment and collaborate outside of his usual genre has contributed to Ghostface Killah's longevity and continued success in the music industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The detective in his stories is called Sherlock Holmes. He solves mysteries in a most surprising way. His assistant, Dr Watson, watches with admiration and then writes up the story of the mystery afterwards. This is a useful story writing skill. Because Watson is not very clever, the story remains a mystery until the end. The readers can sometimes pick up some clues before he does! Then, to make Watson understand the mystery, Holmes has to explain it all, step by step. So we, the readers, get to see it step by step too. Watson is almost as good a character in the story as Sherlock Holmes! The very first time they meet, Holmes greatly surprises Watson. When they are first introduced, Holmes says to Watson, 'How do you do? I see you have been to Afghanistan .' Watson is too amazed by this to ask Holmes how he knows this. Watson has, indeed, been to Afghanistan. Later, he asks Holmes about it. Holmes explains that there is nothing magical about what he does. He gets to know it all by very, very careful observation . Observation One Watson was introduced to Holmes as a doctor. Yet Holmes thought that the way he stood and walked made him seem like a soldier. So, this meant he was probably an army doctor. Observation Two Watson's face was quite dark skinned. But his wrists were pale. So his dark face was probably sun burnt. This meant that he had been to a hot, sunny country. Observation Three At the time, the British army had soldiers at bases in many parts of the world. So there were still a lot of places to choose from. However, Holmes saw that Watson looked very tired and he was always holding his left arm, as if it was painful. So, he had probably been with the army to a place where they were fighting. There was only one place where the British army was fighting at that time: Afghanistan.

Measurement of membrane, cytoplasm, and nuclear levels of Met could offer a superior approach to traditional IHC.', \\"Fluorescent-based IHC for Met was done in 583 colon cancer patients in a tissue microarray format.

Probability distributions of Met within each compartment were determined, and an automated scoring algorithm was generated. An optimal score cutpoint was calculated using 500-fold crossvalidation of a training and test data set. For comparison with conventional IHC, a second array from the same tissue microarray block was 3,3'-diaminobenzidine immunostained for Met.\\", \\"In crossvalidated and univariate Cox analysis, the membrane relative to cytoplasm Met score was a significant predictor of survival in stage I (hazard ratio, 0.16; P = 0.006) and in stage II patients (hazard ratio, 0.34; P < or = 0.0005).

In the 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-stained array, no associations were found with Met expression and survival.Question: Is the relative distribution of membranous and cytoplasmic met a prognostic indicator in stage I and II colon cancer? Output:","output":"Yes, the relative distribution of membranous and cytoplasmic Met is a prognostic indicator in stage I and II colon cancer. In the given passage, it states that the membrane relative to cytoplasm Met score was a significant predictor of survival in stage I (hazard ratio, 0.16; P = 0.006) and in stage II patients (hazard ratio, 0.34; P < or = 0.0005).

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Venice, the Three Musketeers Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans), with the help of Athos' lover, Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich), steal airship blueprints made by Leonardo da Vinci. However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) for their failure.One year later, the young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, like his father once was, only to learn that they no longer exist. D'Artagnan ends up challenging Captain Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen), the leader of Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. In an attempt to get revenge, D'Artagnan offends Athos, Porthos and Aramis for petty reasons, and schedules duels with each of them, at the same day and at the same place, but in different times, not knowing who they are.Before they can duel, however, D'Artagnan and the Musketeers are attacked by the guards for breaking the law by having a public duel. They fight the soldiers off, at which point D'Artagnan discovers their true identities, but end up being captured and brought before the young King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) and his wife, Queen Anne (Juno Temple). Richelieu attempts to convince them to execute the four prisoners, but they are too impressed, and congratulate them instead, much to Richelieu's anger.Later, Richelieu meets with Milady, who is actually working for him. He orders her to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions and steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace and hide it in the Tower of London with the objective of framing Queen Anne of having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham, who is in France on behalf of the King of England, and who has built a fully armed airship using the designs stolen from the Musketeers.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: After the cancellation was announced, how did the people of North Korea feel about it? Options: - They had no opinion about it - They support their leaders - They are offended about the decision - not enough information A:","output":"Not enough information. The context provided does not mention how the people of North Korea felt about the cancellation of the military exercises."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Sentence: 'a mounted televising next to a mounted wall mirror'. Count the number of vowels in the given sentence. A:","output":"Part #1: Understand the different types of letters in the alphabet. Usage: In English, the alphabet has 26 letters, and they can be divided into two main types: vowels and consonants. Vowels are letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and sometimes 'y', while consonants are all letters other than vowels. For instance, in the word 'cake,' 'c' and 'k' are consonants, and 'a' and 'e' are vowels. Part #2: Identify what you're being asked to count, either vowels or consonants. Usage: In this example, you're being asked to count the number of vowels. So, in the sentence \\"a mounted televising next to a mounted wall mirror\\", 'a', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'i', 'i', 'e', 'o', 'a', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'a', 'i', 'o' are vowels. Part #3: Count the type of letters specified. Usage: In this step, you would count the number of vowels identified in the sentence. There are 17 vowels in the sentence \\"a mounted televising next to a mounted wall mirror\\". So, the response would be 17. Part #4: Prepare the final answer based on the calculation. Usage: Your task is done once you've counted the vowels.

Two men are jousting inside a gym. they","output":"Step 1: Identify the situation In this scenario, two men are jousting inside a gym. Step 2: Understand the context Jousting is a medieval sport where two armed opponents on horseback charge at each other with lances. However, since they are in a gym, it is likely that they are participating in a modern, adapted version of jousting, perhaps using different equipment (such as foam lances) and safety gear. Step 3: Consider possible outcomes There are several logical outcomes that might follow a jousting match: 1. After they complete a round of jousting, they might pause to reset their positions and prepare for another round. This is because jousting matches typically involve multiple rounds until there is a winner. 2. If one of the men scores a point or manages to unseat the other, a winner might be declared for that round. This depends on the rules of the jousting match and how points are scored. 3. One of the men may call for a break or request to stop the match. This may be due to fatigue, injury, or discomfort with the situation. 4. The two men may halt the jousting match to discuss and review their techniques, as it can be a learning opportunity for both. Step 4: Choose the most logical next event Based on the context and possible outcomes, the most logical next event is that the two men would either pause to reset their positions for another round (Outcome 1) or that a winner would be declared for that round (Outcome 2).

Up until the junior year I did not realize my capabilities   as a student. Being in the IB Program, I was told that my junior year would be the toughest in all the years of high school. With this \\"little\\" piece of information, I walked into my junior year, scared of my grades. As weeks went by, I started to believe that the junior year was not as hard as everyone had said, but I was wrong. My grades were rapidly declining  and by the end of the first term I had had five Cs in seven of my classes! I could not believe it --- I did not want to believe it. I tried my best to get my grades up myself without any help from anyone, but my pride just made my grades worse. And I had to miss out on one of the most important speech and debate competitions all year: States. I was heartbroken. I realized that I could not survive my junior year on my own, so I had to get help fast. Once I got a tutor, my grades went from Cs, Ds, and even some Fs, to nothing but As and Bs.

Teacher:In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. The passage is unrelated if it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Passage: The chemist published a paper. In the photo she wore a cowboy hat. Student:","output":"Understanding the task: The task is to classify a given passage into one of three categories: stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. The passage contains information about a person or group that either follows a common stereotype (over-generalized belief), goes against a common stereotype (anti-stereotype), or does not involve stereotypes at all (unrelated). In this instance, we have the following passage: Passage: \\"The chemist published a paper. In the photo she wore a cowboy hat.\\" To solve this task, we should identify if the passage is conveying a stereotype, an anti-stereotype, or is unrelated to stereotypes. Solution: In this passage, the chemist's gender and profession don't strictly conform to any stereotypes, as it avoids specifying any gender roles in the field of chemistry. However, the fact that she wore a cowboy hat in the photo might be seen as an anti-stereotype, as it breaks the common stereotype of scientists, particularly chemists, being overly serious or only dressing in lab coats. So, based on the guidelines, the passage can be classified as an anti-stereotype."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Zombie Review #3 **Spoilers** Few films are actually \\"so bad they're good\\", and Zombi 3 is not just bad, it's wretchedly, unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them all More than that, it's a film credited to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency, sense or reason. However we can't blame Fulci as it wasn't really directed by him but by Bruno Mattei, who doesn't even have Fulci's sense of style to help carry the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude. So, I'm ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin characters, weak story, and lack of film making skill, Zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it's even funnier than Nightmare City. The \\"action\\" starts when the \\"Death 1\\" gas is stolen from a military base, and damaged in the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the US military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea? All these questions and more will fail to be answered in Zombi 3.... After hiding out at a hotel, the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it, sending \\"Death 1\\" up into the atmosphere resulting in... zombie birds! Who then attack people and turn them into zombie people!!! (if zombies are cannibals, why don't the zombie birds just attack other birds?) Then we meet our \\"heroes\\", a trio of horny GIs and a coachload of girls. There's a couple of other guys with them too, but they're not important - NO ONE is important here. You'll be hard pressed to remember anyone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to care about them. They end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief (\\"a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it's buzzing with flies!\\") but there's no escape from the undead. By this point you'll either be completely sucked in or you'll have turned the damned thing off. The script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldn't save it, so it's just as well they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters, the zombie acting here is an all time low. There's no consistancy in how the zombies behave - some shamble about in the time honored style, others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk (a gimmick that gives the film it's HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING). They die from gunshots to the chest (rather than the head) and even get knocked out by a good left-hook. How can you punch out a zombie???!!!!! In fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of V... The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life. They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in the water, and even underneath pregnant women. At one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat her? No! To push her into the water, those zombies and their wacky sense of humour! There is plenty of gore though. Limbs are hacked, wounds ooze green pus, and there's much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in. There's nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing, but if bad make up effects are your bag you won't be let down.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Cells in the pancreas release insulin - Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal - Blood sugar is too low - The amount of insulin goes down - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon - The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose - The liver releases the glucose into the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process is the consumption of food and the subsequent digestion and absorption of nutrients, particularly carbohydrates. The detailed process is as follows: 1. Food consumption and digestion: An individual consumes food containing carbohydrates, which are broken down into simpler sugars, such as glucose, during the process of digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. After carbohydrates are broken down, glucose molecules enter the bloodstream. 2. Cells in the pancreas release insulin: As blood glucose levels rise after food consumption, the beta cells of the pancreas detect this increase and respond by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream. 3. Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood: Insulin facilitates the uptake and utilization of glucose by cells in the muscles, liver, and fat tissue, reducing the blood glucose levels. 4. Blood sugar goes back to normal: As a result of insulin action, blood glucose levels return to the normal range. 5. Blood sugar is too low: If blood glucose levels start to drop too low (such as during periods of fasting or intense physical activity), the body needs to restore the balance of glucose in the bloodstream. 6. The amount of insulin goes down: When blood glucose levels are low, the pancreas decreases the release of insulin to prevent further glucose uptake by the cells. 7. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: In response to low blood glucose levels, the alpha cells of the pancreas release the hormone glucagon. 8. The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose: Glucagon signals the liver to convert its stored glycogen into glucose through a process called glycogenolysis. 9. The liver releases the glucose into the blood: The glucose created from glycogen breakdown is released into the bloodstream, raising blood glucose levels. 10. Blood sugar goes back to normal: As a result of this homeostatic mechanism, blood glucose levels return to the normal range. In summary, the missing first step preceding insulin release by the pancreatic cells is the consumption of food, digestion, and absorption of carbohydrates, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. This step initiates the cycle of blood sugar regulation involving the interaction between insulin and glucagon secreted by the pancreas and their effects on glucose utilization and liver glycogen breakdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910?, using the article: The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W...., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the information given in the article, the answer to the question would be: The last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910 is Mahler. This is because the article states: \\"the symphony was a critical and popular success when he (Gustav Mahler) conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The text provides valuable advice for individuals aspiring to become ballet dancers. Correct posture is essential in ballet, and the passage outlines a helpful technique to achieve and maintain proper alignment. Ballet is a highly technical and precise art form that requires a strong foundation in specific body positioning, including maintaining good body posture while dancing. Proper posture enhances a dancer's balance, strength, and grace, contributing to effective and efficient dance movements. It also helps prevent injuries that can occur due to poor alignment and technique. In the given text, the first step advises to gain knowledge about the types of ballet. This is important because different ballet styles, such as classical, neoclassical, or contemporary, may have specific posture requirements unique to their technique. Understanding these distinctions will help dancers meet the demands of various ballet styles. The hand placement, as described in the substeps, is a practical method to assist dancers in discovering and maintaining a neutral spine – a critical aspect of proper ballet posture. Placing the hand beneath the middle of the back and above the tailbone serves as a physical reminder and guide to help dancers maintain the appropriate curve in the lower back, which is necessary for a balanced and upright stance.

India is home to a diverse range of religious beliefs, but Hinduism is the largest and most influential. The country is known for its rich cultural heritage, including temples, rituals, and festivals, which are primarily influenced by Hinduism. Hinduism has a deep historical connection to India, with its roots in the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 2500 to 1500 BCE) and the subsequent Vedic period (circa 1500 to 500 BCE). Although India stands as the only country with a Hindu majority, there are other countries with significant Hindu populations. In most of these countries, Hinduism thrives as part of the minority religious landscape. Here is a list of countries with sizeable Hindu communities: 1. Nepal: While Nepal is predominantly a Hindu-majority country, it is officially a secular state. Hinduism is practiced by about 81% of the population, making it the second-largest Hindu populated nation after India. 2. Bangladesh: In Bangladesh, about 8.5% of the population practice Hinduism. Despite being a minority religion, Hinduism has a significant influence on the country's culture. 3. Indonesia: Although Indonesia is known as the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, it has the fourth-largest Hindu population globally. Bali, in particular, holds the largest concentration of Hindus in Indonesia, with over 80% of the island's population following the religion. 4. Pakistan: Hinduism is a minority religion in Pakistan, accounting for about 1.85% of the population. The majority of Pakistani Hindus resides in Sindh province. 5. Sri Lanka: Hindus make up around 12.6% of the population in Sri Lanka. The majority of Sri Lankan Hindus are Tamil-speaking. 6. Malaysia: In Malaysia, Hindus constitute about 6.3% of the population. The majority of Malaysian Hindus are ethnic Tamil, with a noticeable presence of other Indian ethnicities such as Telugu, Malayali, and Punjabi. 7. United States: Hinduism is practiced by approximately 1% of the population in the United States. The country has seen a significant increase in the Hindu community due to immigration from countries like India and Nepal. 8. United Kingdom: The United Kingdom also has a growing Hindu population, accounting for about 1.5% of the total population. Most British Hindus live in England, predominantly in London and other major cities. 9. South Africa: Hindus form around 1% of South Africa's population, with the majority residing in and around the city of Durban. 10. Canada: In Canada, Hindus make up 1.5% of the population. The majority of Canadian Hindus reside in major cities such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. 11. Australia: Approximately 1.9% of the Australian population identifies as Hindu. Cities like Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth are home to significant Hindu communities.

A:","output":"No, the right answer to the question is not \\"volume.\\" Energy enters ecosystems primarily in two forms: sunlight and chemical compounds. Sunlight provides energy in the form of radiant energy (also known as solar energy) that drives photosynthesis in plants, algae, and some bacteria. In photosynthesis, these autotrophs (also known as primary producers) convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose and other organic compounds. Chemical compounds, on the other hand, are a source of energy for heterotrophs (organisms incapable of photosynthesis). Heterotrophs, including animals, fungi, and certain bacteria, consume organic compounds, either directly or indirectly, to obtain the energy stored within their chemical bonds. For example, animals eat plants or other animals to get energy, and fungi decompose organic matter to extract energy.

Friends say Floyd and Margaret Nordhagen were on their way to buy cat food at the store before the accident.      92-year-old Floyd Nordhagen and his 88-year-old wife Margaret have been part of the Elk Community for decades. They were members of the Elk Community Church and cared for several animals. Their son, Marv Nordhagen, says they have cats, dogs, and cattle he is now trying to find a place for.      According to people in the area, the two were always together and often came to Big R, near where the crash happened.      Floyd is described as someone everyone like, a man who would help anyone in need, and a husband who always took great care of his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's.      A family friend says one day Floyd stopped him and said, make sure you always hug and kiss your wife, that is something I do everyday.

Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.  Question: \\"When the Libyan members of al Qaeda renounced their connections?\\" Response: \\"Before  Bin Laden announced that he can no longer protect them\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

As you deal with the emotional and physical impact of your breakup, compose a meal plan each week to ensure that you continue your healthy eating habits.  Prepare as many of your own meals as possible to avoid triggers such as rich pastas or booze. Review your meal plan to ensure each meal has a variety of vitamins and nutrients. Start your day with a healthy breakfast. Pack your lunch or pick out a dish from an online menu before you go to a restaurant. Include restaurant meals, exercise, rest and other activities such as seeing friends on your plan. These can help you feel better in addition to maintaining your healthy eating habits.  Be aware of places you may be more likely to indulge and stress-related food cravings.  Avoid putting these in your meal plan to keep you on track. Visiting with friends can often soothe the blow of a breakup. Many people get together with friends for meals at restaurants. You also may simply not feel like cooking. If you are going to a restaurant, it can derail your otherwise healthy habits. Consciously staying away from certain foods at restaurants can help maintain your good eating habits.  Steer clear of unhealthy offerings such as breadbaskets, buffets, dishes in heavy sauces, and fried foods. Choose healthy options such as salads, steamed vegetables, lean steaks, and fish. Select fruit for dessert or share a piece of fruit pie or cake with a friend. Some days you may just feel like giving in to your food cravings. No person is perfect and sometimes it's ok to indulge yourself. Allowing yourself an occasional cheat day won't set you off track and may help you maintain your healthy diet in the longer term.  Incorporate a cheat day or two into your weekly meal plan. You may want your cheat day to be when you're spending time with friends or don't have any plans and can stay at home and eat to your heart's content. Eat whatever you want on your cheat day without guilt or worry. This may help you feel better about your breakup or drown out bad feelings you're having. Alcohol can alter feelings and perception. You may reach to booze to drown out the feelings you have after a breakup. However, alcohol is a depressant and may actually make you feel worse. In addition, it can derail your healthy eating habits because it lowers your inhibitions and ability to metabolize food properly.

Help as much as you can. The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This adaptation, like 1949's *The Heiress*, is based on the Henry James novel. *The Heiress*, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James' original story than this new remake, which retains James' original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (Leigh), devoted to her father (Finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man (Chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. She's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly  it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in *The Truth About Cats and Dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where *Washington Square* differs from *The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it.

On one hand, the reviewer appreciates the new adaptation's faithfulness to the original Henry James novel and praises some of the performances, particularly those of Maggie Smith and Ben Chaplin. They also recognize Leigh's handling of a challenging role. However, on the other hand, the reviewer has some criticisms. They find the main character unlikable and the film tedious, with too little story to keep the viewer engaged throughout its runtime. Additionally, the reviewer is not completely convinced about Leigh's portrayal of the main character.

(Associated Press)      FILE – In this May 15, 2018, file photo, acting New York state Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood speaks in Albany, N.Y. Underwood has subpoenaed all eight Roman Catholic dioceses in the state as part... (Associated Press)      ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has subpoenaed all eight Roman Catholic dioceses in the state as part of an investigation into the handling of sex abuse allegations.      A law enforcement source familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press the subpoenas went out Thursday.      The subpoenas seek documents relating to abuse allegations, payments to victims or findings from internal church investigations.      Underwood's office is pursuing a civil investigation into the church's response to abuse reports and has also reached out to local prosecutors authorized to convene grand juries or pursue criminal investigations.      Church officials say they will cooperate.      The announcement comes three weeks after a grand jury investigation found rampant sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by about 300 priests in Pennsylvania. ||||| Attorney General Underwood has launched a clergy abuse hotline and online complaint form through which victims and others can provide information as part of the Attorney General’s ongoing investigation into sexual abuse of children within the New York dioceses of the Catholic Church.      The Attorney General’s Charities Bureau has launched a civil investigation into how the dioceses and other church entities – which are non-profit institutions – reviewed and potentially covered up allegations of extensive sexual abuse of minors.      The Attorney General’s Criminal Division is also seeking to partner with District Attorneys—who have the power to convene grand juries—to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute any individuals who have committed criminal offenses that fall within the applicable statutes of limitations.      Click here to read the full announcement.      1-800-771-7755 ||||| A bill that would amend the statute of limitations to allow more victims to seek justice has for years failed to pass the state Legislature. On Thursday, Ms. Underwood urged the Legislature to pass the bill, known as the Child Victims Act, which would allow all victims to file civil suits until age 50 and seek criminal charges until age 28.      But she also urged any victim of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy, or anyone who knows about abuse, to participate in her investigation, even if they believe that their information may be outside the statute of limitations for a court case.      “All victim information will be helpful to understanding and reforming the institutional approach of the church,” she said.      The potential scope of the investigations is huge. In the Archdiocese of New York alone, 315 victims of sex abuse by clergy have recently received compensation through an independent program sponsored by the church. In the Diocese of Brooklyn, some 250 victims have filed claims through a similar program. These programs did not offer compensation to victims abused by priests working for religious orders, so many more victims may reach out to report abuse through the hotline.      The Diocese of Buffalo has been swamped with abuse revelations in recent months. In February, a retired priest admitted to The Buffalo News that he had molested probably dozens of boys at multiple parishes from the late 1960s until the 1980s. Since then, abuse by other priests has also come to light, raising questions of why it was kept secret for so long.      There have been calls for the bishop of Buffalo, Richard J. Malone, to resign, but he has said he will not. In contrast, the bishop of Albany, Edward Scharfenberger, has taken a more proactive approach to the crisis, recently sending a letter to parishioners telling them that he had asked the Albany district attorney to review the diocese’s records on sex abuse allegations.      “In the spirit of transparency and in an effort to restore a sacred trust that has been broken again and again, I believe a fully independent investigation, one coordinated by the district attorney, is the only way forward,” he wrote in the letter. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has subpoenaed all eight Roman Catholic dioceses in the state as part of an investigation into the handling of sex abuse allegations. The subpoenas demand documents related to abuse allegations, payments to victims, and findings from internal church investigations. Underwood’s office aims to assess the church's response to abuse reports and has also reached out to local prosecutors authorized to convene grand juries or pursue criminal investigations.

This is caused by a combination of adiabatic ( friction ) heating and kinetic compression . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other. They convey the same fundamental idea using slightly different terminology. Both sentences describe a process that is caused by a combination of two factors, with the main difference being the use of the terms \\"ribbed heating\\" and \\"friction heating.\\" Let's break down the similarities and differences between the sentences. 1. Both sentences begin with \\"This is caused by a combination of,\\" indicating that they are explaining the cause of a specific phenomenon or process. This structural similarity sets the stage for the two sentences to be paraphrases of each other. 2. In the first sentence, the term \\"adiabatic (ribbed) heating\\" is used, while the second sentence employs \\"adiabatic (friction) heating.\\" The term \\"adiabatic\\" refers to a process in which heat does not enter or leave the system, and thus, the temperature change is solely due to the work done on or by the system. In both cases, the word in parentheses indicates the primary source of this heating:    a. \\"Ribbed heating\\" implies that the heating is caused by the contact or interaction of ribbed, or grooved, surfaces. This contact generates heat through the conversion of mechanical energy to thermal energy.        b. \\"Friction heating\\" refers to heat generated by the frictional force that arises when two surfaces are in contact with each other and experience relative motion. This is also a conversion of mechanical energy to thermal energy. Thus, both \\"ribbed heating\\" and \\"friction heating\\" describe a mechanism by which heat is produced due to surface interaction. Since both terms refer to heat generation from contact, and both sentences contain the word \\"adiabatic,\\" it can be concluded that they are indeed paraphrases of each other. 3. Lastly, both sentences mention \\"kinetic compression.\\" This phrase reinforces that the sentences have the same meaning, as it further describes the process being discussed. Kinetic compression refers to the increase in pressure and temperature experienced by a gas or fluid as it is compressed by a moving medium. The consistency of this term throughout both sentences indicates that the two are paraphrases, as they share a common idea. In summary, the sentences are paraphrases of each other because they convey the same fundamental concept using slightly different terms (\\"ribbed heating\\" and \\"friction heating\\"). The presence of \\"adiabatic\\" and \\"kinetic compression\\" in both sentences further strengthens the assertion that they express the same idea."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They both describe the relocation of a campus from Milpitas, California to San Jose, California in the year 2016. However, the structure and word order of the two sentences are slightly different. Let's examine each sentence in detail to understand the similarity in meaning: 1. In 2016, the Milpitas, California campus relocated to San Jose, California. This sentence is formatted in a standard English sentence structure, where first the time frame (\\"In 2016\\") is provided, followed by the subject (\\"the Milpitas, California campus\\"), the verb (\\"relocated\\"), and finally the destination (\\"to San Jose, California\\"). The subject of the sentence is describing a specific campus located in Milpitas, California. 2. In 2016, the campus Milpitas, California moved to San Jose, California. In this sentence, the word order is slightly rearranged. The basic structure is still present, with the time frame (\\"In 2016\\") at the beginning, followed by the subject (\\"the campus Milpitas, California\\"), the verb (\\"moved\\"), and the destination (\\"to San Jose, California\\"). However, the word order within the subject has been altered, with \\"campus\\" placed before \\"Milpitas, California.\\" Despite this rearrangement, it still describes the same event – the relocation of a campus in Milpitas, California to San Jose, California in the year 2016. Both sentences share the same meaning, and anyone reading either sentence would understand that a campus in Milpitas, California relocated or moved to San Jose, California in 2016.

Context: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001.

And the answer is...","output":"Alright, let me help you solve this equation step by step, like I'm explaining it to a 5-year-old. We have the equation: -178 * f = 26 * f - 1728 - 108 1. First, let's put all the \\"f\\" (which means \\"factors\\") on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to subtract 26 * f from both sides. Our new equation after doing that will be:  (-178 * f) - (26 * f) = -1728 - 108 2. Now we need to add the \\"f\\" parts together. (-178 * f) and (-26 * f) will give you (-204 * f). So our equation now looks like: -204 * f = -1728 - 108 3. Next, let's deal with the numbers on the right side of the equation, -1728 and -108. We need to add these numbers together. -1728 + (-108) = -1836. Now our equation is: -204 * f = -1836 4. Finally, we need to find out what \\"f\\" is. Since -204 * f = -1836, we can find \\"f\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by -204.  So, -1836 divided by -204 will give us 9. So the answer is: f = 9"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Toby, an 11-year-old boy, is playing with a ball.

He creates two characters, with the first one being Sharkboy who was raised by sharks and his dad. The second character is Lavagirl who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them alight. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In real life, Max's parents have little time for him, and he is bullied by fellow schoolmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, Mr. Electricidad's (whose name is Spanish for \\"electricity\\") daughter. Linus steals Max's Dream Journal, where all of his ideas are kept, and vandalizes it. The next day, a tornado rages outside the school, and moments later Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear and ask Max to come with them to Planet Drool. They reach Planet Drool via a shark-like spacecraft, where Max learns that the dreamworld is turning bad, courtesy of Mr. Electric (also portrayed by George Lopez), originally the guardian of the dreamworld but now corrupted.Sharkboy and Lavagirl save some children from an out-of-control roller coaster; then, with Max, confront Mr. Electric, who quickly drops them in a part of Planet Drool called the Dream Graveyard where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor (voiced by George Lopez), a robot toy that was never finished being built by Max, but offers them a lift to other parts of the planet. Whilst on the journey, the three form a friendship but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \\"plughounds\\" across the planet.

Tragic: Marijuana activist Jennifer Friede was killed in a head-on collision in Denver with a suspected drunk driver. A prominent medical marijuana activist who insisted that the drug was safer than alcohol has been killed by a suspected drunk driver. Jennifer Friede, 34, died on Saturday when the car she was traveling in was involved in a head-on collision on a freeway in Denver. Police arrested the driver of the other vehicle, which was allegedly being driven the wrong way down Interstate 25, on suspicion of DUI and vehicular homicide. Speaking to The Denver Post, Jeremy DePinto, Ms Friede's boyfriend, said for years the couple had rallied at the Capitol for the expansion of access to marijuana, '...trying to tell people that cannabis was safer than alcohol'. 'It's ironic that it was an uninsured drunk driver that killer her,' he told the news service. The crash happened at around 1am Saturday when the couple were on their way home from a concert. DePinto was driving north in the high-occupancy lane of Interstate 25, near the city's Park Avenue. Quoted in the Denver Post, he told friends at a gathering to celebrate his girlfriend's life, he saw the other car coming towards him: '...you get a little blur, for a second, of disbelief'. When he realised it was a vehicle headed straight for him on the wrong side of the road, he said he looked left and right, realised he was trapped, then veered to the left. He said the other car veered into him. DePinot was seriously injured in the crash; his girlfriend Ms Friede, mother of four children, was killed. Ms Friede was a passenger in a car being driven by her boyfriend on Interstate 25, in Denver (pictured), when the fatal collision happened. The driver of the other vehicle, Rebecca Maez, 27, has previously been arrested by Edgeware Police for DUI, speeding in a construction zone and driving while her licence was under restraint in 2009, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. She remains at the Downtown Denbver Detention Center on 80,000 bond, according to the news service. DePinto described his girlfriend, also known as Jenny Kush, as a talented artist and dessert chef. Less control: Ms Friede and her boyfriend Mr DePinto have campaigned for easier access to cannabis for years. Marijuana has been. decriminalized since 1975, when the state legislature passed a bill. making the possession of the drug a 100 civil fine - not an arrestable. offense. In 1996,. California voters passed a bill that legalized marijuana possession for. medical purposes. Doctors are allowed to prescribe the drug to anyone. with certain chronic medical conditions. Californians with a prescription can obtain an ID card that allowed the poses, grown and consume the drug. Fifty-five percent of voters approved the measure at the time. However, voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. A. 2010 ballot proposition that would have legalized all possession of one. ounce of marijuana or less for adults age 21 and over. It would also. have allowed for the establishment of marijuana cafes and other. businesses. The measure failed 54percent to 46percent.

We all know Cory Booker is America’s “Super Mayor,” a reputation cemented by his many acts of social-media influenced kindness: he’s been lauded for helping a man propose to his girlfriend, letting Hurricane Sandy victims crash at his house and even rescuing a neighbor from a burning building. But did you know that he also helped start a new social media site called #WayWire? Probably not. (READ: TIME’s Full SXSW Coverage) Booker discussed all of these things and more in a wide-ranging chat with TIME.com Assistant Managing Editor Steven James Snyder during a SXSW panel called “Cory Booker: New Media Politician.” The conversation touched on a number of themes, ranging from his worst tweet to his ambitions beyond Newark’s mayorship (more on that soon). (READ: @CoryBooker on the 140 Best Twitter Feeds of 2011) As the panel neared the end, the mayor and would-be senator made a passionate last lap through his themes, launching into a 10-minute monologue that some visitors described as “epic.” Speaking eloquently about how we should be living for our country, achieving societal victories by boosting up those around us, and using technology and entrepreneurship to change the world, the Mayor focused on the power of kind gestures and our collective capacity to shape our government. Booker grew increasingly exuberant as he summarized his call to action, weaving together African proverbs (“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far go together”), historical lessons from the Battle of Bunker Hill and his parents’ passion for equality, hard work and compassion. He circled back to Twitter, praising the social network for allowing him to bring his truth, hope and inspiration directly to the people every single day.

He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.

Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus.

Reactions from Americans are mixed. More than half of the people questioned in a survey think e-cigarettes should be controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration, but 47 percent believe the e-cigarettes should be available to the smokers who want to quit. \\"In the hunt for a safter cigarette, e-cigarettes are becoming a popular choice among those either trying to quit.\\"or looking to replace standard tobacco smoke with an alternative that manufacturers claim to be safer, \\"Zogby International, which conducted the survey, said in a statement. About half of the 4,611 adults who took part in the survey had heard about e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered, or rechargeable cigarettes that vaporize a liquid nicotine solution. They do not produce smoke but a water vapor without smell. Sold mostly on the Internet, e-cigarettes were first made in China. Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using e-cigarettes, saying there was no evidence to prove they were safe or helped smokers break the habit. The WHO said people who smoke e-cigarettes breathe in a fine fog of nicotine into the lungs. Nearly a third of people questioned in the survey think that e-cigarettes should be allowed in places where smoking is forbidden, because they don't produce smoke, but 46 percent disagree. Men who were aware of the availability of e-cigarettes were more likely than woman to say they should be a choice available to smokers who want to quit. Young people, aged 18-29, and singles were the groups most open to trying e-cigarettes. Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable death worldwide, according to the WHO.

The 15-year-old was retired from a breeding programme because he is father to nearly all of Europe's polar bears. He has moved into a 10-acre park in Yorkshire Wildlife Park, which includes 8m deep lakes and an Arctic climate. More polar bears will be arriving to give him some company over the next few months, park officials say. Article:","output":"Title: Victor, England's Solo Polar Bear, Finds Sanctuary in Doncaster Introduction Victor, a magnificent 1,058lb polar bear, has recently taken residence in Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster, England, and currently holds the unique title of being the nation's only polar bear. However, he is not set to remain a loner for long, as park officials report that more polar bears will be arriving in the coming months to keep him company. The bears' new home is designed to replicate their natural habitat as closely as possible, and Victor's arrival is expected to generate significant excitement and raised awareness about polar bear conservation. Victor's Journey to Yorkshire Wildlife Park The 15-year-old Victor traveled to Doncaster from Holland after retirement from a successful breeding program. During his time in the program, Victor became the father to nearly all of Europe's polar bears, undoubtedly leaving an essential mark on the captive population. As a result, it was crucial for conservationists to find a suitable home for him in retirement, and the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, known for being at the forefront of conservation-based projects, proved to be the perfect choice. The State-of-the-Art Sanctuary To accommodate Victor and the other polar bears expected to join him soon, Yorkshire Wildlife Park has created a stunning 10-acre sanctuary featuring 8m deep lakes and a simulated Arctic climate. This fantastic facility will offer the bears the opportunity to live comfortably while allowing visitors to observe the magnificent creatures in a safe and respectful manner. The park, which is home to more than 400 animals from over 70 different species, is well versed in catering to the specific needs of its residents and promises a haven for these majestic mammals. The Importance of Polar Bear Conservation Polar bears, classified as marine mammals, are the world's largest carnivores and are known for their majestic beauty and physical power. However, as a species, these bears are facing severe challenges due to climate change, habitat loss, and human activity. The diminishing sea ice and food shortage are leading to shrinking polar bear populations, making conservation efforts more vital than ever. Facilities like the park in Doncaster play a significant role in raising awareness about these issues among the public and contributing to polar bear conservation. Looking Ahead Yorkshire Wildlife Park's new polar bear resident is set to attract a considerable amount of public interest, and Victor's presence will serve to underscore the importance of polar bear conservation. Park officials are confident that the arrival of more polar bears in the coming months will add to the excitement of visitors, ultimately helping to promote increased awareness and appreciation for this majestic and endangered species. In conclusion, Victor's arrival at Yorkshire Wildlife Park is a significant event for England, as it draws attention to the importance of polar bear conservation and offers an exceptional example of how wildlife parks can contribute to animal preservation. Visitors now have the unique opportunity to witness the incredible beauty and power of these bears in a carefully designed habitat that closely replicates their natural environment. With more polar bears set to join Victor soon, the park is undoubtedly taking an essential step forward in ensuring the well-being and continued existence of these majestic mammals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title: The AT amp;T Corporation, the nation #39;s largest long-distance provider, said yesterday that it would eliminate more than 20 percent of its work force this year and write off 11.","output":"Title: The AT&T Corporation: Drastic Work Force Reduction and a Substantial Financial Write-Off The AT&T Corporation, currently recognized as the nation's largest long-distance provider, has recently announced a major restructuring plan that is expected to significantly impact both its employees and financial performance. This drastic measure involves eliminating more than 20 percent of its workforce this year, coupled with a substantial financial write-off of 11 billion. The decision is a result of various factors that have compelled the AT&T leadership to reassess its operational framework and adopt a new approach to manage its rapidly evolving business landscape. These factors include increased competition in the telecommunications industry, the rise of new communication platforms, and technological advancements that have rendered various job roles obsolete. As part of its restructuring plan, AT&T aims to accomplish several critical objectives in order to maintain its leading position in the market and ensure long-term sustainability. Some of these objectives include the following: 1. Streamlining Operations: By reducing its workforce by more than 20 percent, AT&T intends to achieve higher operational efficiency and eliminate redundancy. This measure will allow the company to focus on its core competencies and swiftly adapt to new market trends. 2. Cost Saving: The reduction in workforce is expected to result in substantial cost savings for AT&T, which will help improve the company's overall financial health. This decision is particularly crucial in an increasingly competitive industry where cost management directly influences market competitiveness. 3. Technological Advancements: AT&T is consciously navigating the ever-changing technological landscape by shifting its focus to embrace new innovations. This may require reallocating resources from traditional long-distance services to invest in advanced technologies, such as 5G networks and other sophisticated communication solutions. 4. Employee Skill Development: With a leaner workforce, AT&T will have the opportunity to invest in the professional growth of its remaining employees. By providing them with access to training programs and professional development opportunities, the company can nurture a more skilled and adaptable workforce that supports its future ambitions. 5. Addressing Customer Needs: AT&T's decision to write off 11 billion can be seen as an acknowledgement of the need for adaptation and transformation in response to changing customer needs. This write-off will enable the company to pivot and allocate resources to emerging markets and customer segments, aligning its strategic approach with market demands. In conclusion, the AT&T Corporation's decision to eliminate more than 20 percent of its workforce and write off 11 billion signifies a radical turning point in the company's history. This strategic move aims to strengthen the company's position in the market, improve operational efficiency, and embrace technological advancements to ensure long-term growth and success. Consequently, stakeholders, employees, and customers alike should expect a renewed focus on innovation and strategic evolution as AT&T takes on the challenges presented by an increasingly competitive telecommunications industry."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a paragraph, a question, and a candidate incorrect answer to the question.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Shelly loves who?\\", I will consider the following steps: 1. Analyze the structure of the sentence: The sentence consists of three words: \\"Shelly\\" (a proper noun), \\"loves\\" (a verb), and \\"who\\" (an interrogative pronoun). The sentence seems to be a question asking about the object of Shelly's affection. 2. Check for grammatical correctness: In English, subject-auxiliary inversion is generally used when forming questions. However, in this sentence, the subject \\"Shelly\\" and the verb \\"loves\\" are not inverted. The more standard way to phrase the sentence would be, \\"Whom does Shelly love?\\" 3. Assess the clarity and understandability of the sentence: Despite the grammatical discrepancy, the sentence is still relatively clear and easy to understand. Most English speakers would likely be able to comprehend its meaning as a question asking about the person that Shelly loves. Conclusion: While the sentence \\"Shelly loves who?\\" is not the most grammatically correct way to phrase the question, its linguistic integrity is mostly preserved due to its clarity and understandability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`United States Commission on  Rebuilding America for the 21st Century Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds the following:             (1) In 1808, Albert Gallatin, while serving as President          Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury, reported to          Congress on the infrastructure investments needed by the young          Nation.             (2) Gallatin's plan built on President George Washington's          vision of connecting the interior settlements of the Nation          with the markets and ports of the East Coast through a network          of roads and canals, and provided a roadmap for infrastructure          development in the 19th century.             (3) In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt convened a          conference of State and territorial governors, members of his          Cabinet and Congress, professional organizations, private          citizens, and government agencies to plan for the United States          conservation and infrastructure needs in the 20th century.             (4) The resulting plan laid the groundwork for many of the          critical investments initiated by President Franklin D.          Roosevelt to jumpstart the Nation's recovery from the Great          Depression.             (5) Today, as in 1808 and 1908, the United States is faced          with significant economic, environmental, and demographic          challenges.             (6) To stave off the worst effects of global warming, the          United States will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions          significantly.             (7) The Nation's population is projected to increase to 420          million by 2050, which is nearly a 50 percent increase from the          Nation's population size in 2000.             (8) By 2050, more than 70 percent of the Nation's          population growth and economic growth is expected to take place          in extended networks of metropolitan regions linked by          environmental systems, transportation networks, economies, and          culture.             (9) The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue          Study Commission recently calculated that maintaining the          Nation's existing transportation system over the next 50 years          will require 225 billion annually. The latest transportation          authorization, SAFETEA-LU, provided only 244 billion total for          the 5 years ending with fiscal year 2009.             (10) The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the          Nation's public infrastructure, consisting of water, sewer, and          transportation systems, a grade of D-minus, estimating that it          will cost 1.6 trillion over the next 5 years merely to repair          the Nation's existing infrastructure.             (11) The Nation's decaying water infrastructure and a lack          of available funding to maintain and upgrade the Nation's          wastewater infrastructure pose a serious threat to water          quality. More than 72,000 miles of municipal water and sewer          pipe are more than 80 years old, threatening the health,          environment, and economy of communities large and small.             (12) Population growth and associated development will          place the Nation's water resources under increasing stress,          including increased pollutant loads, increased potential for          flooding, diminished drinking water supplies, loss of aquatic          habitat, and stream scouring and erosion. Global warming will          exacerbate existing water challenges and make other changes to          the natural hydrology, including more extreme storm events,          more frequent droughts, higher air and water temperatures,          changes in timing of stream flows, and sea level rise. New          technologies and a comprehensive strategy will be needed to          overcome these challenges and ensure a safe, adequate,          reliable, and sustainable water supply.             (13) The Environmental Protection Agency, the Congressional          Budget Office, and other stakeholders have identified a funding          gap of between 300 billion and 400 billion over the next 20          years for the restoration and replacement of wastewater          infrastructure, and an additional 250 billion over the next 30          years will be needed to replace worn-out drinking water pipes          and associated structures.             (14) From 1999 to 2009, the Nation's electricity demand          rose by nearly 20 percent while transmission capacity grew by          only 3.5 percent. To accommodate increased demand, and to          accommodate increased electrical supply from renewable sources          by 2050, electrical transmission infrastructure requires          significant investment.             (15) The Nation's rural economy is dependant on          transportation and communications networks to grow and compete          in an increasingly globalized market.             (16) Significant under-investment in public lands          infrastructure jeopardizes the tremendous conservation,          environmental, and mixed use benefits that these lands provide          the public.             (17) Much of the Nation's infrastructure was built in the          last half of the 20th century and will reach its capacity          limits early in the 21st century. Unless new capacity is          created in roads, rails, airports, seaports, and other systems,          the Nation's economic potential will be artificially limited.             (18) Since 1980, the number of miles people in the United          States drive has grown 3 times faster than the Nation's          population. Residents of walkable cities, however, drive 26          percent fewer miles per day than those living in the most          sprawling areas.             (19) By 2050, 89 million new or replaced homes as well as          190 billion square feet of new offices, stores, and other          nonresidential buildings will be constructed.             (20) By 2050, smart growth building policies could reduce          total transportation-related CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; emissions by 7 to          10 percent.             (21) Development of a bold national plan to overcome these          challenges by 2050 will allow the United States to respond in          the most economically and environmentally sustainable way.

A government report found that women suffer a dramatic loss of earnings one year after separating. Six years after separating women's incomes are still 12 percent lower than the incomes of non-separated women. Despite these figures, Australian women fared better than women from the U.S., UK and Germany. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Women's Earnings Still Impacted by Separation: A Comparative Study on Income Trends in Australia, the U.S., UK, and Germany Introduction: A recent government report has shed light on the financial consequences of separation for women, revealing that women's incomes suffer a significant decline within a year of separating. This trend further follows with earnings still not entirely rebounding even six years after separation. The findings underline the persistent financial imbalance women face after ending a relationship. However, it's worth noting that Australian women are confronting these financial challenges better than their counterparts in other major western countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The Dramatic Loss of Earnings: The report highlights that women's incomes plummet dramatically one year after separating. Numerous factors contribute to this decline, including the difficulty of finding steady employment after taking time off for family caregiving, as well as the obstacles of navigating a challenging job market in the midst of ongoing gender pay gaps. Although it is essential to address these contributing issues, the numbers presented in the report cannot be understated. They serve as a formidable reminder that separation adversely affects women's earning potential, and more comprehensive support and solutions are needed to help them overcome this financial challenge. The Long-Term Financial Impact: While the immediate impact of separation on women's earnings is significant, the study further confirms that the long-term implications are just as troublesome. Even six years post-separation, women's incomes remain 12 percent lower than the income of non-separated women. This long-lasting financial gap emphasizes that separated women not only face short-term difficulties adjusting to life after separation but are also left grappling with prolonged financial setbacks that follow them for years. The Australian Scenario: Despite the discouraging figures, Australian women have demonstrated impressive resilience, faring better in the economic aftermath of separation than women in the U.S., UK, and Germany. This outcome could be attributed to Australia's relatively robust safety nets and social support programs, which help soften the financial blow experienced by separated women. Nonetheless, it is crucial to continue building on these successes and expanding upon policies and initiatives that facilitate women's financial independence and security post-separation. Conclusion: The devastating financial consequences experienced by separated women underscore the need for robust social services, safety nets, and policies that support gender equality in the workforce. Ensuring that separated women have access to the resources they need to bounce back both professionally and financially is essential on both a personal and societal level. With further research and proactive policy measures, countries like Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany can help pave the way for a future where separation does not result in long-lasting financial distress for women."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Redline Movie plot: Natasha Martin (Nadia Bjorlin) is a beautiful auto mechanic and aspiring musician who is invited to join music producer Infamous (Eddie Griffin) aboard his private jet en route to Las Vegas in appreciation of her services on his Ford GT. She is also a highly skilled race car driver, but is sometimes haunted by memories of her father's death at a NASCAR race many years ago. Meanwhile, on another side of town, Carlo (Nathan Phillips) has just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. He meets up with his brother Jason (Jesse Johnson) before heading to Vegas themselves. Carlo is not happy that Jason is living with their mob boss uncle Michael D'Orazio (Angus Macfadyen), whom he always sees as the cause of their family's destruction. Little do they know that Michael has been running an unsuccessful counterfeiting ring and owes millions of dollars to another syndicate led by the \\"Godfather\\" (David Dayan Fisher). On the outskirts of Vegas, a high-stakes race event is being held, with Michael, Infamous, Hollywood producer Jerry Brecken (Tim Matheson) and Chinese businessman Marcus Cheng (Michael Hagiwara) placing their bets over who has the better car. When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for 300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four platinum bars at stake. At the same time, Brecken wagers his brand-new Enzo Ferrari on Natasha. Natasha (driving a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) takes on Jason (driving a Lamborghini Diablo). As they approach the finish line, Natasha is several car lengths ahead of Jason, but he quickly zips past her by engaging the onboard nitrous system. Unfortunately, because of the excessive speed, the Diablo loses downforce, flies off the ground and flips in mid-air before crashing upside down at the finish line.

A man has been charged with murder after a married couple were subjected to a 'violent and sustained' attack in their £750,000 home. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, appeared at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill today on two counts of murder. Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian Kettyle, 54, were found dead at their Surrey home shortly after midnight on Thursday after police received a call from Mrs Kettyle's 16-year-old son, Timothy. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, (right)  has been charged with murder after the bodies of married couple Patrick (left), 55, and Gillian Kettyle, 54, were discovered at their Surrey home on Thursday. Police confirmed that Bruzas knew Mr Kettyle (pictured) and his wife, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation. Bruzas was found less than five miles from the scene of the murder. Their deaths sparked a police search for Lithuanian builder  Bruzas, 38, who was found later in Oxshott - less than five miles from the scene and arrested on suspicion of murder. A clean-shaven Bruzas, from Walton-on-Thames, wore a navy sweater and grey tracksuit bottoms when he appeared in the dock today, flanked by two guards. The Lithuanian builder spoke only to confirm his age and address during a brief appearance. Kristina Bruziene is reportedly the estranged wife of Bruzas. She was employed by the dead couple as a secretary in 2012. He has been remanded in custody to appear before Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday. Police confirmed that Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation. Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm after the builder introduced them. Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius. He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties. The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007. Bruzas was known by his neighbours as a quiet man who worked hard to support his family. The full results of the post mortems, as well as formal identification of the couple, are expected next week but the initial cause of death has been established as stab wounds. Detective Superintendent Nick May, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said they were killed in a 'significant, violent and sustained' attack. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said after their murders: 'This is a tragic incident which has shaken the close community in Fetcham. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas (pictured) spoke only to confirm his age and address during a brief appearance at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court today.

A forensics officer collects a knife in Fetcham, Surrey, where the couple were found (right). Forensic officers were in the house (left), where police said Mr and Mrs Kettyle were subjected to a 'violent and sustained' attack. The house where the bodies were found is a two-storey detached house with a brick-paved drive and neat bushes at the front, the second house along The Copse. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who assisted with the search of Viktoras Bruzas including members of the public and the media.' Prior to Bruzas' arrest, police had been liaising with both the National Crime Agency and Interpol who were in touch with the Lithuanian authorities. Another man in his 30s who was arrested at a property in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey on Thursday has been released with no further action taken against him, police said. Officers were called to The Copse, a quiet street of detached houses in Fetcham, at around 12.30am on Thursday. Police said that the murders had shaken the close community in Fetcham. Above, the house was cordoned off as the police searched the area after the attack. Police set up at the scene. Senior officers said they had been working with the National Crime Agency and Interpol in a bid to track down the Lithuanian.

Defense attorneys suggested that investigators guided alleged victims on what to say so their stories would be consistent.","output":"Title: Jerry Sandusky's Wife and a Psychologist Come to His Defense in Court Introduction The trial of former Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has seen crucial testimonies and arguments, as his defense team fights to prove his innocence amidst allegations of sexual assault. Key statements have come from Sandusky's wife, Dottie, and a psychologist who has diagnosed Sandusky with a \\"histrionic personality disorder.\\" Moreover, the defense has raised concerns regarding the impartiality of investigators, suggesting that alleged victims were coached on what to say to ensure consistent stories. Dottie Sandusky Stands by her Husband Dottie Sandusky took to the witness stand, providing testimony that her husband had never had inappropriate contact with boys who stayed over at their home. She specifically refuted the account of one man who accused Jerry Sandusky of trying to molest him in a hotel years prior, only to be interrupted by Dottie's entrance. \\"They were just standing ... in a hallway kind of thing ... they had their clothes on; they were fully clothed,\\" Dottie Sandusky recounted. Additionally, Dottie Sandusky denied allegations that their basement had been soundproofed, a detail claimed by some of the alleged victims who said they had been assaulted in the space. Her testimony aimed to bolster the defense's case by shedding doubt on the claims made by her husband's accusers. Histrionic Personality Disorder Diagnosis As the trial continued, a psychologist took the stand, unveiling a diagnosis of Jerry Sandusky that could potentially explain some of his behavior. The psychologist diagnosed him with \\"a histrionic personality disorder,\\" a condition that affects individuals who crave attention and may behave inappropriately. In Sandusky's case, this diagnosis was said to be consistent with the \\"creepy\\" letters that one accuser claimed to have received from the former coach. According to the psychologist, careful analysis of Sandusky's memoir, titled \\"Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story,\\" also supported this diagnosis. He argued that the evidence in the book \\"absolutely confirmed my diagnosis,\\" potentially offering the jury a different perspective on Sandusky's actions that could separate it from intentional criminal behavior. Accusations of Coaching Witnesses The defense team also raised concerns about the investigative process in the trial, suggesting that investigators had guided alleged victims as they crafted their stories, ensuring that their accounts would align with one another. The implication of such coaching undermines the credibility of the testimonies provided, again casting doubt on the validity of the claims against Sandusky. Conclusion The defense team in Jerry Sandusky's trial has made significant strides in presenting alternative explanations for the actions of the former Penn State assistant football coach. The support of his wife, Dottie Sandusky, and the diagnosis of a personality disorder by a psychologist offer the jury new perspectives to consider. Additionally, by raising concerns about the integrity of the investigative process, the defense may have opened the door for jurors to question the trustworthiness of the allegations against Sandusky. As the trial continues, the outcome will ultimately rest on the weight jurors give to these alternative explanations and the credibility of the alleged victims' accounts."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Rest Going to bed is primarily associated with the intention of getting rest. After a long day, it is important for an individual to sleep as it offers numerous benefits for both the mind and body. Sleep provides the body with an opportunity to recover and repair itself, while it helps the brain to better process information, memory, and emotions. Furthermore, sleep is crucial for maintaining good mental and physical health. While some of the other options listed might occasionally be involved with going to bed, such as making love or pregnancy, these acts are more specific and do not primarily represent the fundamental purpose of going to bed. As for insomnia, it rather represents a difficulty in falling or staying asleep, which is counterproductive to someone's intention of going to bed for rest. Finally, finding gold is not related to going to bed at all and can be ruled out as a reasonable option. In conclusion, the option that aligns with common sense when answering the question of what someone is trying to get by going to bed is undoubtedly rest. Sleep is an essential aspect of human life and contributes to overall well-being, making it the most sensible answer among the given options."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

English: Display of the accurategear tooth form with animation/simulation of the tooth mesh Spanish:","output":"Muestra de la forma precisa del diente de engranaje con animación/simulación de la malla de dientes In the given sentence, every key term and concept has been translated from English into Spanish as follows: - \\"Display\\" translates to \\"Muestra\\", which means showing or presenting something for others to see or examine. In this context, it conveys the idea of exhibiting or making the gear tooth form visible for the purpose of inspection and analysis. - \\"Accurate\\" translates to \\"precisa\\", which is the Spanish equivalent for something that is correct, exact, or free from errors. In the context of the gear tooth form, it denotes that the shape or geometry is precise and reliable. - \\"Gear tooth form\\" translates to \\"forma del diente de engranaje\\", which refers to the shape, profile, or contour of the individual gear teeth. This term encompasses geometric specifications like tooth thickness, height, and angles, which determine how well the gears can interact and transmit power or motion. - \\"With animation/simulation\\" is translated as \\"con animación/simulación\\", indicating that the display of the gear tooth form incorporates dynamic or interactive elements that help visualize the operational behavior of the system. Animation usually implies a sequence of images or frames that depict movement or change over time, whereas simulation suggests a computational or mathematical model that replicates real-world conditions and processes. - \\"Tooth mesh\\" translates to \\"malla de dientes\\", which characterizes the arrangement or configuration of the gear teeth as they come into contact with each other. The term \\"mesh\\" highlights the interlocking or interplay between the teeth, which is crucial for transmitting force, maintaining proper alignment, and minimizing wear and tear. As a whole, the translated sentence captures the essence of the original English text and effectively conveys the concept of illustrating the precise geometry of gear teeth through animated or simulated visualizations that depict their interactions in a realistic manner. This serves as a valuable tool for understanding, designing, and optimizing gear systems and their various applications across industries and disciplines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Of course, \\"Flatley\\" is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but I think Michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title: \\"Feet of Flames\\"  One really can't resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray to the retiring (and clearly, ailing) Flatley. I might add that, much like that cheering London crowd (per review below), I too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance. \\"Hinting that it may be his last live performance, Flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic London crowd.\\" ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide Now, what is this review like? pick from the following. (I) negative. (II) positive.","output":"The review given is primarily negative. First, it begins by making light of Michael Flatley's surname and its association with his dancing profession, implying a form of irony. This sets a mood of slight mockery. Next, it turns into a more pointed critique. The reference to \\"Desenex Foot Spray\\" is a snide suggestion that Flatley may be suffering from some foot issue, possibly due to his dancing; an unkind jab at his physical condition in relation to his profession. The reviewer also does not seem to hold any admiration for his new title, \\"Feet of Flames,\\" situating it as an extension of the earlier irony mentioned. The point about retirement and describing Flatley as \\"ailing\\" also conveys the image of a performer past their prime and possibly not at the height of their talents or skills anymore. This is not a complimentary suggestion in any case, and speaks to a negative perception towards Flatley and his capabilities. Furthermore, the enthusiasm the reviewer expresses about this being Flatley's last live performance could easily be read as them rejoicing at his retirement, or the end of his performances, rather than expressing excitement about the performance itself. Lastly, the quotation about the cheering London crowd, while seemingly a positive addition to the review, is framed sarcastically - a further indication of the author's lack of genuine enthusiasm or positivity towards Flatley's performance. It seems to be used more to underline the reviewer's earlier points rather than to highlight Flatley's popularity or talent. Therefore, both the express language and implied sentiments suggest that this review is largely negative, as it criticizes and makes light of various aspects of Michael Flatley's professional status and performance."},{"instruction":"Instructions: This task evaluates for the ability to follow basic natural language instructions nested and performing a sequence of operations, including basic logic and conditionals.

Knowing one of these statements to be true does not inherently confirm or negate the truth of the other statement. Let's analyze both statements: 1. \\"A woman and man are dancing on grass.\\" - This statement tells us that there is a couple dancing on a grassy area. However, without further context, we cannot determine if this statement is true. 2. \\"There are people playing instruments in the parking lot.\\" - This statement informs us that there is a group of individuals playing instruments in a parking lot, suggesting the presence of some musical performance or gathering. Again, there is no direct connection between this statement and the first one, and we cannot determine if this statement is true without further information. If you are provided with more details, such as the connection between the dancing couple and the people playing instruments, then it would be possible to ascertain whether the premise \\"A woman and man are dancing on grass\\" is true given the context of the second statement.

Let's start with the first sentence. English: Moncler Womens Vests are the most universal item of clothing ever created... Spanish: Los chalecos de mujer Moncler son la prenda de vestir más universal que jamás se haya creado... I translate Moncler Womens Vests to \\"los chalecos de mujer Moncler\\", using \\"los\\" because it's a masculine word in Spanish, despite referring to women's article of clothing. Universal translates directly to \\"universal\\". And clothing items would be translated as \\"prenda de vestir\\".  Now let's proceed with the second sentence: English: ...and are easy to be matched with a simple tank top... Spanish: ...y son fáciles de combinar con una simple camiseta... Tank top translates to \\"camiseta\\", and \\"easy to be matched\\" could be translated to \\"son fáciles de combinar\\", which maintains the original meaning and natural Spanish flow.  Onto the third and fourth sentences: English: ...with simple dressing but not the simple style, it will make you very unique in public... Spanish: ...con una vestimenta sencilla pero no un estilo simple, te hará muy única en público... \\"Dressing\\" here does not refer to salad dressing, but it refers to the way one dresses. So it would be translated as \\"vestimenta\\". The rest of the words have direct translations in Spanish. Finally, the remaining text: English: ...increase the sense of versatility, as it can be worn often and can be matched with almost everything else in your closet. Spanish: ...aumenta la sensación de versatilidad, ya que se puede usar a menudo y se puede combinar con casi todo lo demás en tu armario. \\"Increase\\" translates to \\"aumenta\\", \\"sense of versatility\\" to \\"sensación de versatilidad\\", and \\"it can be worn often\\" to \\"se puede usar a menudo\\". \\"Can be matched with almost everything else in your closet\\" can be translated as \\"se puede combinar con casi todo lo demás en tu armario\\".

Answer the following question: Question: \\"How was the CAF struggling?\\"  Context: \\"In 2008 the Government of Canada made efforts, through the Canada First Defence Strategy, to modernize the Canadian Armed Forces, through the purchase of new equipment, improved training and readiness, as well as the establishment of the Canadian Special Operations Regiment. More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) was struggling in several ways before the implementation of the Canada First Defence Strategy in 2008. The main challenges the CAF faced included outdated equipment, insufficient training and readiness, dwindling recruitment numbers, and high attrition rates. 1. Outdated equipment: Prior to the Canada First Defence Strategy, the CAF had been operating with outdated and insufficient equipment, which limited their capabilities in various military operations and deployments. 2. Insufficient training and readiness: The CAF also suffered from inadequate training and readiness, which affected their ability to effectively address various military situations and challenges. 3. Dwindling recruitment numbers: Recruitment had been on the decline since the 1980s and 1990s, potentially due to the Canadian public's perception of the CAF as peacekeepers rather than soldiers. A 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence highlighted this sentiment, as well as the desire for the CAF to focus on responding to natural disasters. 4. High attrition rates: The CAF was losing existing members at an alarming rate, with attrition increasing from 6% to 9.2% annually between 2006 and 2008. The then Chief of the Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, acknowledged this issue in 2008, indicating that while recruitment efforts had become more successful, retaining current members remained a significant challenge. In summary, before the implementation of the Canada First Defence Strategy in 2008, the Canadian Armed Forces struggled with outdated equipment, insufficient training and readiness, dwindling recruitment, and high attrition rates. Efforts made through the strategy aimed to modernize the CAF, improve training and readiness, establish the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, and allocate more funds towards recruitment to address these challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - An egg is laid by a mother bird - A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized - The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg - The baby bird is unable to fly to get food - The mother bird must feed the baby bird food - The bird grows stronger and grows wings - The bird is able to fly - The bird is able to leave the nest and find food - The bird is able to reproduce.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more magma comes from volcano happens, how will it affect MORE birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Assess the connection between the perturbation and the process The process is about the life cycle of birds while the perturbation deals with more magma coming from a volcano. On the surface, they appear unrelated, however, volcanic activity could have an indirect effect on the process. Let's examine the possible impacts step by step. Step 2: Analyze the impact of increased volcanic activity on habitat and food resources Increased volcanic activity might lead to the destruction of bird habitats, such as nest sites, as well as damaging the ecosystem that supports their food resources (e.g., plants, insects, and other animals). This could potentially disrupt the life cycle of birds from the egg stage to adulthood. Step 3: Consider the effects on bird reproduction If there is a significant loss of resources as a result of increased volcanic activity, this could lead to a possible decrease in bird reproduction rates since they might struggle to find suitable nesting locations and enough food to support offspring. Step 4: Examine the impact on the bird's development Stronger volcanic activity could also impact air quality due to the release of sulfur dioxide and other gases. This might negatively affect the respiratory health of birds, reducing their ability to grow, fly, and find food. Step 5: Analyze long-term effects In the long term, the increased volcanic activity might significantly alter the bird populations and the ecosystem, leading to a potential decline in the number of birds and other species that can successfully reproduce and survive. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation of more magma coming from the volcano does have an indirect effect on the process of a bird's life cycle. It could potentially impact the habitat, food resources, reproductive rates, development, and overall health of bird populations. This could lead to a decline in the number of birds that can successfully reproduce and survive in the long run."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A colloid: It is a mixture where particles are dispersed throughout another substance but are not dissolved. The particles in a colloid are larger than those in a solution but smaller than those in a suspension. So, this option is incorrect. b). A solution: It is a homogeneous mixture where particles of a solute are completely and uniformly dispersed in a solvent. Sugar and water create a homogeneous mixture when the sugar is fully dissolved. So, this option is correct. c). A suspension: It is a heterogeneous mixture where particles are dispersed through a fluid but are large enough to eventually settle out.

Konta, now the world number seven, admits she was \\"pretty serious\\" about her tennis from the age of nine, and her sleep-deprived father would no doubt agree. His daughter used to drag him out of bed at five in the morning to go for a run. And her work ethic and attention to detail have been apparent to everyone she has come into contact with. \\"If she has a routine to follow, she will follow it to the letter. It's almost robotic, but actually a huge strength,\\" says Judy Murray, a former captain of Britain's Fed Cup team. And, according to Pete McCraw - Tennis Australia's national women's coach when Konta was based in Sydney, she had a willingness to separate herself from her peers and was comfortable standing out from the crowd. The dedication and sacrifices have paid huge dividends in the past 12 months as Konta has won WTA titles in Los Angeles,Sydney and Miami. The Wimbledon title is her next major goal. The list of potential champions may be long, but it includes the 26-year-old, who has become one of Britain's most successful athletes. So, who is the real Johanna Konta? Before tennis became her obsession, Konta can remember offering some treats to rainbow lorikeets on the balcony of her parents' flat. She soon discovered the medium-sized parrots would settle on the palm of her hand in exchange for a few granules of sugar. One of her earliest tennis memories, though, is less comforting. \\"I remember being at the net and being hit in the eye by what I thought at the time was this massive boy,\\" she recalls. \\"He smashed a ball into my eye. It didn't go blue or anything but I'm pretty sure I was afraid to be at the net for a while - but I got over it pretty quickly.\\" Konta was introduced to tennis at the age of eight, and the sport soon played a hugely significant role in her life. \\"I remember that I was very dedicated to working hard. I would do anything I could or needed to do to be better, to be fitter, to be stronger,\\" Konta says on a BBC Radio 5 live special. \\"I didn't have very many friends when I was younger. I think because I was competitive and really committed to doing the work. I think that sometimes sets you aside from the norm.\\" Konta says she loved school, and loved learning, but realised home schooling was the only option if she was going to commit to the travel usually required to build a path into the professional ranks. At the age of 12, Konta found herself in Mildura, in the north west of the state of Victoria, to compete in the junior grass-court national championships. It was the first time McCraw - Tennis Australia's newly appointed national women's coach - had set eyes on her. \\"What caught my eye was a girl who, at an early age, was comfortable separating herself from her peers - a girl who brought a meticulous, organised, motivated approach to her tennis,\\" he said. At the time, Konta was rated as just the 388th best junior in Australia - a ranking that would not typically attract attention from a national coach. McCraw noted her tenacity, drive, enthusiastic spirit, infectious smile and unrelenting desire to succeed. He frequently found her warming up, skipping and practising shadow swings long before the other juniors were on site. \\"She loved writing what she had learned in her notebook,\\" he remembers. \\"She always had a clean grip on her racquet, her water bottle was full, and she was always on time. Probably the strongest memory is that she was always up for learning even when she was working on areas of her game that were not her strength. \\"Sooner or later in tennis, you are going to have a peer group of one. You need to have a willingness to separate yourself, and Johanna brought that with her. \\"She would even put her bag slightly offset from the other girls' bags in a communal place.\\" Konta had to separate herself from her parents for four months as a 14-year-old to attend the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona. She remembers \\"waiting at the pay phone by the reception area every evening waiting for them to call\\". Soon afterwards, the English south-coast resort of Eastbourne became home as her Hungarian parents decided to settle in the UK. Konta has been happy in the past to describe herself as \\"highly strung\\". But that is perhaps less evident since she started to invest so much time in the mental aspect of her sport. \\"There was a stage in my development where it was one of my main challenges to relax more,\\" Konta recalls. \\"I think I will always have an element of that but I like to think that, as I get older, I will have a better management of it and become calmer. I find myself someone who is deeply loyal to the people who are close to me. \\"I'm very much a home body. I love the comfort of family, of home and I believe I'm quite a passionate person as well.\\" Konta says she loves eating and has recently enjoyed experimenting in the kitchen. She believes she makes really good roast potatoes and is \\"very close to attempting to make muffins\\". Judy Murray sees a woman who has not always found it easy to deal with the attention associated with a sudden rise from 150 in the rankings to the world's top 10. \\"You're suddenly in the spotlight and it's how much of yourself you want to share with everybody else, and not every player is comfortable doing that,\\" says Murray. \\"She's quite quirky, she's good fun. I think she keeps herself to herself and she's perfectly entitled to do that.\\" My hunch is Konta has many strong opinions, but chooses to bite her tongue despite often persistent questioning. \\"I find that a lot of things get taken out of context,\\" she explains. \\"Even when you read articles, you still don't hear the tone of voice or the context in which it was said. I'm not talking specifically about me, I'm talking articles in general - I think it's a difficult art to capture the emotion the athlete is actually speaking with.\\" Murray believes it is important for the future of women's tennis that players are prepared to express their personalities and offer wider opinions about the game. For the most part, Konta remains guarded in post-match interviews and refers to \\"staying in the process\\" and \\"keeping things in perspective\\". But it was only relatively recently - at the US Open of 2015 - that Konta's efforts started to attract wider attention. So will she reveal more as she becomes more accustomed to life at the top? \\"I think, for me, it's not something that comes naturally. I am quite a private person but I also understand the importance of sharing my journey with not just the people that are following my progress, but also with young girls who want to become an athlete.\\" Summary:","output":"British tennis player Johanna Konta, now ranked world number seven, has become one of Britain's most successful athletes through her dedicated work ethic and attention to detail, with the Wimbledon title as her next major goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Bill to legalize pot widely expected to pass in Tuesday vote. It would give Uruguayan government authority to regulate production and distribution. Supporters say it will put drug traffickers out of business. Opponents say it's dangerous because it will make more marijuana available. Article:","output":"Title: Uruguay Set to Legalize Pot: A Turning Point in the War on Drugs? Uruguay is on the verge of a groundbreaking legislation that is expected to pass on a Tuesday vote. The bill seeks to legalize pot, granting the Uruguayan government the authority to regulate its production and distribution. This landmark move is predicted to have significant impacts on the drug trafficking industry and the availability of marijuana. Supporters of the legalization argue that, by taking control of the marijuana market, the government will be able to effectively push drug traffickers out of business. The idea is that a regulated market will be more transparent and secure, allowing law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal activities more efficiently. This new legislation would, in turn, contribute to the improvement of public health and security, as marijuana consumers would have access to a safer, regulated product rather than one sourced from the black market. Opponents of the bill, however, express concerns about the potential dangers associated with making marijuana more readily available. They argue that legalization could lead to an increase in drug consumption, causing adverse effects on the health and safety of individuals and communities. Moreover, there is a fear that legalized marijuana could become a gateway drug, tempting people to try harder, more dangerous substances. Regardless of the outcome of the vote, the bill has already sparked a lively debate on drug policy reform and the effectiveness of current strategies to curb drug trafficking and consumption. Uruguay stands at a critical turning point—one that could potentially influence the direction that international drug policies take in the future. If the bill passes, it remains to be seen whether the government’s efforts to regulate marijuana will ultimately prove successful in reducing drug trafficking and its associated ills. Moreover, global eyes will be on Uruguay to determine whether the legalization of pot serves as a catalyst for change or sets a precedent that other countries are unwilling to follow."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You probably need to have an affiliation to South Africa to \\"get\\" some of the gags. Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The tone of this product review is absolutely positive. There are multiple indicators within the text that suggest this. Firstly, the title, \\"Love this old classic,\\" unequivocally conveys a strong sentiment of affection and appreciation for the product. The word 'love' is a strong, positive word, especially when used in a review context and suggests the author has strong positive feelings. Furthermore, 'classic' often refers to something that is judged over a period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind, which reaffirms the positive sentiment. Secondly, in the review body, the reviewer refers to relatable nostalgia that the product invoked (\\"This takes me back to my childhood in South Africa\\"). People tend to view their past, especially their childhood, through rose-tinted glasses and thus recounting such memories often carries a positive connotation. The use of 'Hilarious,' which means extremely amusing, also helps identify the feeling of joy and amusement the reviewer experienced, adding to our understanding of the positivity in their tone. Extra nuances show the uniqueness of the product and personal connection with it, for example: \\"You probably need to have an affiliation to South Africa to \\"get\\" some of the gags\\". This not only portrays the product positively, suggesting that it's filled with culturally specific humor that might be more appreciated by someone who understands those cultural subtleties, but also shows the profound connection the reviewer felt with the product due to their South African background.

China #39;s Lenovo Group is in talks with a major international IT company regarding an acquisition, it said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday.","output":"The statement released on Tuesday refers to China's Lenovo Group, a multinational technology company, engaging in advanced discussions with an unspecified global Information Technology (IT) company about a prospective acquisition deal. Lenovo Group is a leading technological firm with a presence in multiple countries and known for producing a diverse range of products. These products include laptops, smartphones, tablets, servers, and other IT equipment. Although the announcement did not name the international IT company in question, it does signify Lenovo's continuing endeavors to expand its operations and global market share. By entering into acquisition talks with a major IT firm, Lenovo aims to: 1. Bolster its product portfolio: Acquiring another IT business could potentially supplement Lenovo's existing range of products and solutions, giving it leverage in previously untapped technological areas. 2. Strengthen its market presence: An acquisition could boost Lenovo's market position, both in its domestic market (China) and internationally. By assimilating a global IT firm, Lenovo may gain access to new markets, customer segments, and distribution channels, further strengthening its business strategy. 3. Enhance research and development (R&D): Merging with a major IT company could elevate Lenovo's R&D capabilities by extending its access to cutting-edge technologies, knowledge, and research facilities. This would help maintain its innovative edge and competitiveness in an industry characterized by rapid technological developments. 4. Improve operational efficiency and cost-saving synergies: Acquiring another company could provide Lenovo with opportunities to streamline its operations, optimize its management structure, realize economies of scale, and lower overall costs. These cost-savings might result from reduced duplication of efforts, shared resources (including talent, technology, and facilities), and a more effective supply chain. 5. Foster collaboration and innovation: Integrating the resources, expertise, and knowledge of both companies could create a powerful synergistic effect, fostering joint innovation and impelling both organizations to develop next-generation products and solutions. It is important to note that the announcement mentioned the talks that are being conducted; however, there is no guarantee that the acquisition will come to fruition. Several factors may affect the outcome, such as the final price of the deal, regulatory approvals, and the ability for both companies to reach a mutual agreement on a range of related issues. In conclusion, Lenovo's announcement about engaging in acquisition talks with a major international IT company underscores its efforts to expand its portfolio, strengthen its market presence, and enhance its capabilities. Although the outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, a successful acquisition could lead to significant growth opportunities for Lenovo in the global technology space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Question: \\"Who made the following remark: \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\"\\" Response: \\"Sothesby\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Although the phrasing is different, the end goal is the same. Here is a detailed and long answer to address the query: To find and get a list of all your Gmail accounts, you can use various methods. While Google doesn't provide a direct tool to view all your accounts at once, you can still find your Gmail accounts by following the steps below: 1. Account Recovery: One way to try finding your Gmail accounts is by using the Google Account Recovery process. Follow these steps: a. Visit the account recovery page: https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery b. Enter your phone number or alternate email address (if you provided any during the account creation). Google will send you a list of your Gmail addresses associated with the provided information. 2. Password Managers: If you use a third-party password manager like LastPass, 1Password, or Dashlane, these tools might store your Gmail account credentials. Check the entries in your password manager for any Gmail addresses. 3. Browser: Your web browser often saves login information for different websites. If you have logged into your Gmail accounts using a browser: a. On Chrome: Go to Settings > Passwords (or type chrome://settings/passwords in the address bar), and look for any Gmail addresses saved in the list. b. On Firefox: Go to Options > Privacy & Security > Saved Logins (or type about:preferences#privacy in the address bar), and check for Gmail addresses. c. On Safari: Open Safari Preferences > Passwords, and review the passwords list for Gmail addresses. 4. Connected Applications: Since many online services and apps require a Gmail address for signing up, you can look through your other online accounts and check the email address used to register them. This might give you a hint of any Gmail accounts you may have used. 5. Systematic Search: Try and recollect any pieces of information that may be associated with your Gmail accounts - names, phone numbers, or recovery email addresses. Make a list and try each one using Google's Account Recovery process to find the linked Gmail accounts. Remember that for security reasons, Google will not provide you with a list of Gmail addresses without the proper identification process. So you need to use the tools and methods mentioned above to retrieve your accounts.

Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Great\\" The answer is:","output":"Based on the limited information provided by the single-word review \\"Great,\\" it is challenging to assign a precise star rating. However, we can infer from the positive nature of the word that the reviewer had a good experience or a favorable opinion on the subject being reviewed. With \\"Great\\" being an expression of approval or satisfaction, one could deduce that the implied rating would likely be towards the higher end of the scale. To assign an estimated star rating, we can analyze the word \\"Great\\" in the context of the 1 to 5-star rating system: 1. ★ - Poor: A single star rating represents an unsatisfactory or very negative experience that does not match the sentiment of \\"Great.\\" 2. ★★ - Fair: A two-star rating acknowledges some redeeming qualities or improvements to be made, which does not fully capture the positive connotation of \\"Great.\\" 3. ★★★ - Good: A three-star rating suggests an overall pleasant experience, with some areas that could be improved upon. While \\"Great\\" can be considered as a higher form of appreciation, a three-star rating might be a conservative interpretation compared to other options. 4. ★★★★ - Great: A four-star rating aligns well with the word \\"Great\\" and may indicate a substantially positive experience with minor imperfections or areas that could be improved. A four-star rating also implies that the reviewer is recommending the subject, which is in line with the sentiment expressed. 5. ★★★★★ - Excellent: A five-star rating represents an exceptional experience or product with nothing significantly wrong. While it is possible the reviewer meant \\"Great\\" in this context, it may be too strong an assumption to make based on a single word. Considering the possible interpretations, we can estimate the implied star rating of the single-word review \\"Great\\" as ★★★★ (4-stars) since the word aligns well with the meaning behind the four-star rating.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Brewster's Millions Context: Montague L. Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home in New York City to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down. During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise. When Brewster's chartered yacht is disabled by a leftover U-boat mine, he escapes from his containment and makes it to the bridge to order the captain to radio for help. Brewster learns...

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? For both bond premiums and discounts, the company will have to make an initial journal entry when the bonds are sold that records the cash received and the discount or premium given. In both cases, bonds payable will be credited for the total face value of the bonds.  Using the previous example, with the company issuing 200,000 bond would record a 200,000 credit to Bonds Payable. If the company sells the bonds with a 2,000 discount, the company would debit the cash account for the cash received, 198,000 (200,000 - 2,000) and debit Discount on Bonds payable for the amount of the discount, 2,000.  Similarly, if the company sells the bonds with a 2,000 premium, the company would debit the cash account for cash received, which would total 202,000 (200,000 + 2,000). They would also credit Premium on Bonds Payable for the amount of the premium, 2,000. When the next entries are made, the company will have to determine how much of the premium or discount to amortized. This amount will reduce the balance of either the discount or premium on bonds payable. If they are using straight-line depreciation, this amount will be equal for every reported period. For simplicity, we still stick to using this method in the example.  Imagine that for our example 200,000 bond issue, the bond makes a coupon payment twice per year, or every six months. This means that we will make two entries per year that record interest expense. Additional entries must be made at the same time for the proper amount of amortization of premiums or discounts.  Because it is a 5-year bond payable semi-annual payment, we will amortize one-tenth of the premium or discount in each period (5 years x twice per year). For our 2,000 premium or discount, this means recording 200 amortization each time. In order to properly report amortization, we will also need the know the amount of interest expense paid to bondholders over the same period. This is the amount of the coupon payment, based on a percentage of the par value. It is made in annual or semiannual payments to bondholders. Calculate annual interest expense by multiplying the coupon rate, or interest rate, by the par value of the bond. Divide this number by two to get the semiannual interest expense. For the example 200,000 bond, the interest expense would be found by multiplying the coupon rate, 10%, by the par value, 200,000. This gives 20,000. Therefore, the semi-annual interest expense recorded would be half of that, or 10,000. For each year, the company must record any interest expense paid incurred from the sale and maintenance of bonds. This includes both the coupon payments made to bondholders plus or minus the premium or discount amortization. For semiannual payments, the company would record both interest payments made within the year separately, along with their respective amortizations.  This is recorded with a debit to interest expense for the total interest expense, which is either the semiannual interest payment plus the amortization on the discount or minus the amortization on the premium. For a discount, there are also a credit to cash account for the amount of interest expense and a credit to discount on bonds payable for the amount of the amortization. These are entered equally for both semiannual payments. For a premium, there are also a debit to premium on bonds payable for the amount of the premium amortization and a credit to the cash account for the amount of the interest payment, For example, using the aforementioned 200,000 bond sale and a discount, we would recognize the 10,000 semiannual interest payment plus the 200 discount amortization as a debit to interest expense for a total of 10,200. We would also credit discount on bonds payable for 200 and credit the cash account for 10,000. Summary:","output":"When a company sells bonds with a premium or discount, they must record the cash received, the discount or premium given, and the total face value of the bonds, and then determine how much of the premium or discount to amortize each reporting period based on coupon payments made to bondholders."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Two new planets have just been discovered in our solar system. Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries.  Will Millhouse have a higher or lower temperature than Jarthrow?  Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. A:","output":"Millhouse, the planet that outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases, is likely to have a higher temperature than Jarthrow. This is due to the enhanced greenhouse effect where the increased amount of greenhouse gases would trap more terrestrial radiation, leading to an increase in planetary temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Viruses first infect, then they release into the host by doing what?\\" with the following options:  - Cooking  - kill them  - harm them  - lysing  - illness  - fever  - migrate  - propagate A:","output":"Viruses first infect, and then they release into the host by lysing the host cell. This process involves the virus entering and living inside the cells of living organisms, as mentioned in Fact 1. Once the virus has successfully infected the host cell, it begins to replicate within the host cell, using the host cell's machinery and resources to create new viral particles.  In the case of nonenveloped viruses, as stated in Fact 2, these newly-formed viral particles are eventually released into the host organism by lysing the host cell. Lysing is a process wherein the cell membrane or cell wall is disrupted, ultimately causing the cell to break apart or rupture. As a result, the viral particles are dispersed into the host, infecting other cells and continuing the cycle of infection and replication. Among the presented options, lysing is the most accurate description of how viruses release themselves into the host organism after infecting the host cells. Other options provided, such as cooking, illness, fever, migrate, and propagate, are not directly related to the process of a nonenveloped virus releasing itself into the host organism.

In summary, the answer to the question \\"Viruses first infect, then they release into the host by doing what?\\" is lysing. This is because nonenveloped viruses release themselves into the host organism by breaking apart the host cell through lysing, allowing the viral particles to continue infecting other cells in the host's body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords. They wrote the song in three hours.According to Simon Cowell, owner of the music production company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended \\"Halo\\" for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule. Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website Digital Spy, asked Tedder during an interview whether \\"Halo\\" had initially been written for Lewis.

Question: Sugar is added to water and the mixture is stirred. Which observation is evidence that the sugar dissolved in the water? Answer:","output":"When sugar is added to water and the mixture is stirred, there are several observable changes that indicate the sugar has dissolved in the water. Dissolving is a physical process where a solute, in this case sugar, is integrated into a solvent, like water, forming a homogeneous solution. The most evident observation that demonstrates sugar has dissolved in water are: 1. Transparency: The first and most obvious indication that the sugar has dissolved in the water is the transparency of the solution. As sugar dissolves in water, it essentially \\"disappears,\\" leaving the water as clear as it was before the sugar was added. This is because the sugar molecules have become evenly distributed throughout the water, making it impossible to distinguish between the two substances visually. In contrast, when sugar is not dissolved entirely, it may result in a cloudy or hazy appearance. 2. Taste: Another essential sign that the sugar has dissolved in the water is its taste. If you taste the sugar and water mixture, the sweetness of the sugar will be evenly distributed throughout the liquid. This is an indication that the sugar has been integrated into the water, and there is a uniform sweetness in the solution. On the other hand, if the sugar is not fully dissolved, it will be unevenly sweet and may even have a grainy texture. 3. Absence of Sugar at the Bottom: When sugar is not dissolved correctly, it tends to settle at the bottom of the container. If the sugar has dissolved in the water, you will not see any remnants of sugar at the bottom of the container when the liquid is still. This is because the sugar molecules are evenly disseminated throughout the water in the dissolved state. 4. Homogeneous Liquid: A mixture containing sugar and water in which the sugar has dissolved completely is a homogeneous liquid. A homogeneous liquid is a consistent solution throughout, and no sugar can be separated mechanically (e.g., by filtering or straining) from the liquid. By contrast, in an incompletely dissolved sugar solution, the concentration of sugar may vary in different parts of the container. 5. No Crystallization: When sugar is fully dissolved in water, it transforms from its crystal form into a free-moving molecular state, evenly dispersed throughout the solution. This means that even if the solution is allowed to sit undisturbed for a period of time, you should not observe crystallization or visible sugar particles. If sugar is not dissolved correctly, it may eventually recrystallize as the water evaporates or cools, forming sugar crystals in the mixture. In summary, clear and transparent appearance, evenly distributed sweetness in taste, absence of sugar residues at the bottom of the container, a consistent and homogeneous liquid, and no crystallization are the critical observations that serve as evidence that sugar has dissolved in water. It is essential to remember that dissolving is a physical process, and sugar can be recovered by evaporative techniques such as boiling the water to retrieve the sugar in its original crystalline form."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion? ?  Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Q:Process:  - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less body movement occurs happens, how will it affect muscles contracting MORE INTENSELY.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that if less body movement occurs, could potentially affect the intensity of muscle contractions. The effect might not be direct on the entire process, but there could be indirect consequences. When there is less body movement, the muscles do not contract as frequently or forcefully, which can lead to muscle atrophy and weakness. In turn, this could affect the intensity of muscle contractions as the muscles lose strength and contractile capacity. Furthermore, reduced body movement could affect the brain's ability to send the necessary electrical signals to the muscles effectively, as lesser neural connections may be formed and strengthened between them. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis itself does not directly impact the entire process of muscle contraction, it can potentially lead to indirect consequences such as muscle atrophy, weakness, and reduced neural connections.
