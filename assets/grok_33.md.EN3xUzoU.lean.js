Wanting to relive the days of his youth, Mr. Grumpy texts all his friends and asks them out to the pub but they are all too busy, that is until three months later when they have managed to plan a night out together.","output":"Title: Mr. Grumpy and the Ludicrous Quest for Youth Once upon a not-so-ordinary day in the quirky world of the Mr. Men series, Mr. Grumpy woke up with a peculiar thought, “Am I really a grumpy dad?” This was, of course, a rhetorical question because everyone in the book, including the narrator (yes, me), knew the answer was a resounding “Absolutely!” Mr. Grumpy’s daily routine consisted of running around after his children like a headless chicken on a caffeine overdose. He took them to parties where the only games were “Guess How Long Till Mr. Grumpy Snaps” and swimming, where he was the unofficial lifeguard for kids who, frankly, swam better than him. But the real test of his grumpiness came when his eldest daughter, Little Miss Wants-a-Lot, demanded a computer and phone because, according to her, “Everyone has one, Dad!” Mr. Grumpy, who believed the height of technology in his day was a rock and a stick, snapped, “In my day, we had to walk fifteen miles through a blizzard to tell someone a meme!” This statement puzzled everyone since memes didn’t exist back then, leading to a collective eye-roll from the audience. Realizing he was the embodiment of grumpiness, Mr. Grumpy decided to relive the days of his youth, which everyone knew was going to be an uproarious disaster. Firstly, he tried to text his friends for a night out at the pub. Now, let’s pause for a moment. Mr. Grumpy using a phone was as absurd as a fish riding a bicycle. After several misunderstood emojis and accidental calls to strangers (including a 3 AM facetime to his boss), he actually managed to send the invite. His friends, however, were too busy living in the 21st century and replied with things like, “Sorry, mate, got yoga,” or “Can’t, I’m binge-watching this new show about watching paint dry.” It was a tragicomedy. Fast forward three months, because yes, it apparently takes that long to organize a night out when you’re past your prime and your friends need to check their diaries, consult their spouses, and perhaps even align the planets. Finally, on the long-awaited night, Mr. Grumpy and his cohorts gathered at the pub. Let’s picture this scene: a bunch of middle-aged Mr. Men characters trying to relive their glory days in a pub that had probably seen better days itself. Mr. Tickle kept accidentally elbowing the bartender, Mr. Bump was in a corner, wrapped in bubble wrap as a preventive measure, and Mr. Messy, well, let’s just say the less said about his attempts at “flair bartending,” the better. Amidst this chaos, Mr. Grumpy had an epiphany. He didn’t need to relive his youth to be less grumpy; he just needed better coping strategies for his daughter’s techno-demands. And maybe, just maybe, a modern gadget or two to keep up with the times. “So, let me get this straight,” Mr. Silly piped up. “You went through all this to realize you just need to chill out and maybe learn how to use a smartphone properly?” “Yes,” Mr. Grumpy sighed, finally understanding the moral of their bizarre adventure. “And it took us 15 pages of nonsensical hilarity and questioning the logic of this entire plot to come to that conclusion?” Mr. Logical added, always one to point out the absurdity in any situation. Precisely. And with that, Mr. Grumpy glanced at the readers (that’s you), gave a wry smile, and whispered, “Thanks for sticking around for this bonkers ride. I guess we all learned something, didn’t we?” The end. Or is it just the beginning of Mr. Grumpy’s next illogical yet hilarious adventure?

This code aims to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application that can connect to a Discord bot, fetch text channels from a specified server, and then listen to local server messages to forward them to a selected Discord channel. Below, I'll break down the core components of your script and highlight some key aspects and potential improvements. # Core Components: 1. **Kivy GUI**: You're leveraging Kivy to create the GUI part of your application. This includes text input fields for entering the bot token and server ID, a button to start the bot, fetch channels from the specified guild (server), and a scroll view for channel buttons. The GUI is built in a way that enables user interaction to control the bot and specify the server and channel for messaging. 2. **Discord Bot**: You're using the \`discord.py\` library to interact with Discord. This bot fetches channels from a specified server and listens to incoming messages from an external (local server) source to forward them to a chosen Discord channel. It's important to ensure you're using the correct version of \`discord.py\` or a suitable fork like \`pycord\`, considering \`discord.py\` has had significant updates and changes. 3. **Asynchronous Programming**: The application utilizes \`asyncio\` for asynchronous programming, necessary for the Discord bot's operation and handling the network communication without blocking the GUI thread. 4. **Threading for Network Listening**: A separate thread is spawned for listening to messages from a local server using a traditional blocking socket. This is because Kivy's main loop and Discord's asynchronous loop are both running in the main thread, so the socket's blocking nature is put in its thread to prevent it from freezing the GUI or the asynchronous loop. # Key Aspects: - **Integration of Asyncio with Kivy**: Your approach to integrate asyncio with Kivy's main loop using \`Clock.schedule_interval\` allows the asyncio event loop to work alongside Kivy. This is crucial for maintaining responsiveness in the GUI while also running an async Discord bot. - **Guild and Channel Management**: The bot fetches and displays guild channels dynamically, enabling the user to select where messages received from the local server should be forwarded. - **Separate Listening Thread**: Running the server listening logic in a separate thread is a good practice to avoid blocking the main GUI or the asynchronous event loops. However, when receiving data and invoking Kivy-related operations from this thread, you correctly utilize \`Clock.schedule_once\` to ensure thread safety when updating the GUI. # Potential Improvements: - **Error Handling**: Consider adding try-except blocks around network operations and async tasks to handle potential failures, such as network issues or incorrect bot token/server IDs. - **Enhanced Bot Token Security**: Storing or entering bot tokens in plaintext can pose a security risk. Consider implementing a more secure method for handling tokens, perhaps through an environment variable or a secure input method. - **GUI Responsiveness**: While the current approach schedules the asyncio event loop to run periodically with Kivy's clock, this could potentially lead to performance issues with more complex operations. Explore optimizing this integration for more intensive tasks to ensure GUI remains responsive. - **Stopping Asynchronous Tasks Gracefully**: Ensure that when the application closes, all asynchronous tasks are properly cancelled, and connections (e.g., to the Discord client or local socket) are closed cleanly to avoid any resource leaks. In summary, your script is an ambitious attempt to cross the boundaries between a GUI application and an asynchronous Discord bot. With potential security improvements and error handling, it could serve as a robust tool for bridging local server events into Discord channels for a variety of applications, such as notifications, monitoring, or simple automation tasks."},{"instruction":"can you make this so fetch channels works when I stat the discord bot and then only the listen stuff is left running and wont stop?","output":"To adjust your code so that the \\"Fetch Channels\\" functionality is automatically executed upon starting the Discord bot, and to ensure that the \\"Listen\\" functionality keeps running without stopping unless explicitly halted or when the application is closed, you can make the following modifications: 1. **Automatically Fetch Channels After Bot Start**: You can call the \`fetch_channels\` method directly after the bot has started. To do this correctly within the async context, you can use an event listener for the bot's \`on_ready\` event. 2. **Ensure Continuous Listening**: The listening loop already runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main GUI or the async event loop. It's designed to keep running until the socket is closed or an error occurs. Ensure that this behavior aligns with your expectations, and consider implementing a mechanism to gracefully stop this thread when the application is closing. Here's how you can implement these adjustments: # Adjusting the \`DiscordGUI\` class 1. **Automating Channel Fetching**: We will utilize the \`on_ready\` event of the bot to automatically fetch channels once the bot is fully ready. Add the event listener inside the \`__init__\` method of the \`DiscordGUI\` class: \`\`\`python class DiscordGUI(BoxLayout): def __init__(self, **kwargs): # Existing initialization code... # Add an event listener to the bot for when it's ready @self.bot.event async def on_ready(): print(f'{self.bot.user} has connected to Discord!') await self._fetch_channels() # The rest of your __init__ method... \`\`\` With this addition, \`_fetch_channels\` will be called automatically when the bot is ready, eliminating the need for a separate button to fetch channels manually. Please note that \`self._fetch_channels()\` is now called without parameters. Ensure that \`_fetch_channels\` can be called this way, or adjust it accordingly. Since it already looks up the guild ID from the GUI directly, this should work as intended. 2. **Continuous Listening**: Your existing \`_listen_server\` method within the \`DiscordGUI\` class already sets up continuous listening in a separate thread. Ensure that this thread is correctly managed upon application exit: \`\`\`python def listen_server(self, instance): if self.match_channel and not hasattr(self, 'listen_thread'): self.listen_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._listen_server, daemon=True) self.listen_thread.start() \`\`\` By setting the thread as a daemon (\`daemon=True\`), you ensure that it will not prevent the main program from exiting. However, ensure you handle the cleanup properly if there are resources that need to be explicitly closed when the application stops. 3. **Graceful Shutdown**: To ensure a clean shutdown, you might want to improve the \`on_stop\` method in the \`DiscordApp\` class: \`\`\`python class DiscordApp(MDApp): # Existing methods... def on_stop(self): # Cancel the bot task if hasattr(self.gui, 'bot_task'): self.gui.bot_task.cancel() # Attempt to gracefully close the listening socket, if applicable \`\`\` With these adjustments, the \\"Fetch Channels\\" functionality will be automated upon bot startup, and the listening thread is ensured to run continuously in a manner that's safer and cleaner during application shutdown.

This generally happens for several reasons: 1. **Server Not Running**: The most common reason is that there's no server running on the specified \`localhost\` address and port (\`12345\`) to accept the connection. Ensure that your server application is running and properly listening on this port before the client (your Discord bot application) attempts to connect. 2. **Firewall or Antivirus Blocking**: Sometimes, a firewall or antivirus software on your machine may block the connection. Check your firewall settings and ensure that the port \`12345\` is allowed for inbound and outbound connections. 3. **Port Misconfiguration**: Ensure that the port number you're using in your client code (\`12345\`) matches exactly with the port number that your server is listening on. A mismatch here would lead to a connection refusal. 4. **Server Bind Address**: If your server is not specifically bound to \`localhost\` (127.0.0.1) but to a different IP address or all interfaces (\`0.0.0.0\`), there might be a mismatch in where it's listening and where your client is trying to connect. Ensure both are consistent, or simply try connecting to the exact IP address the server is bound to. # How to Troubleshoot: - **Check if the Server is Running**: Before running your Discord bot, ensure that the server it tries to connect to is already running and properly set up to accept connections on the specified port. - **Try a Simple Echo Server**: You can quickly test if the issue is with your network setup by running a simple echo server and trying to connect to it using a basic socket client script or even telnet. Here's a simple example of an echo server in Python: \`\`\`python import socket def echo_server(host, port): with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s: s.bind((host, port)) s.listen() print(f\\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\\") conn, addr = s.accept() with conn: print('Connected by', addr) while True: data = conn.recv(1024) if not data: break conn.sendall(data) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": echo_server('localhost', 12345) \`\`\` - **Review Firewall/Antivirus Settings**: Temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus to test the connection again (ensure you're in a safe network environment when doing this). If it works, re-enable your firewall/antivirus and configure it to allow traffic through the port. - **Check Port Availability**: Ensure that the port \`12345\` is not used by another application. You can check using tools like \`netstat\` on Windows or \`lsof\` on Unix systems. # Final Note: If you're developing both the server and the client, make sure the server is up and running before the client tries to connect. If the problem persists after checking these points, consider reviewing your server's code or setup to ensure it's correctly configured to accept connections."},{"instruction":"old code work for the listen server cross ref it","output":"To accurately cross-reference and ensure compatibility with your existing code that worked for the listening server functionality, let's first establish a clear understanding of how the listening server code was structured. The crucial aspects of a working listening server setup include: 1. **Server Setup**: A server listening on a specific port, ready to accept connections. 2. **Client Connection**: A client (in your context, the Discord bot application) that attempts to connect to the server at the specified address and port. Assuming your previous working setup involved a simple server listening on \`localhost\` (127.0.0.1) on port \`12345\`, and given your recent code for the client side within the Discord bot application, let's ensure the client-side setup is correct for connecting to such a server. # Client-Side Code for Connecting to the Server: Your provided client-side code for connecting to the server within the Discord bot application is structured as follows: \`\`\`python def _listen_server(self): server_address = ('localhost', 12345) with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock: sock.connect(server_address) while True: data = sock.recv(1024) if not data: break shared_dict = pickle.loads(data) Clock.schedule_once(lambda dt: self.send_message_to_discord(shared_dict)) \`\`\` This snippet correctly represents a client attempting to connect to a server listening on \`localhost\` at port \`12345\`.

If the server expects a different protocol or handling, the client code might need adjustments. 4. **Network Configuration**: Make sure there's no network configuration (e.g., VPN, virtual machine network adapters) that could interfere with the connection to \`localhost\`. 5. **Consistent Error Handling**: If your server might close the connection or if there's a risk of connection errors, adding error handling around \`sock.connect\`, \`sock.recv\`, and \`pickle.loads\` could help make the client more robust. If after these verifications the issue persists, it would be helpful to revisit the specific server code you're trying to connect to for further troubleshooting. Ensure that both the client-side and server-side code are compatible regarding the networking protocol (TCP in this case) and the data format being used."},{"instruction":"can you fix the listen code?","output":"To address the connection issues you're experiencing and ensure the \\"listen\\" functionality works as intended, I'll provide a revised version of the \`_listen_server\` method with added error handling.

This problem typically arises when there are concurrent attempts to read from the same websocket connection, violating the constraints imposed by \`aiohttp\` (or similar libraries) that require websocket reads to be serialized, i.e., one at a time. Given the context and the traceback, it seems the issue lies within the Discord client's interaction with the Discord API via websockets, managed by the \`discord.py\` library and \`aiohttp\` for asynchronous HTTP/WebSocket requests. Here are several approaches and considerations to help you troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: # 1. Ensure Latest Library Versions First, ensure you're using the latest versions of \`discord.py\` (or its active fork, such as \`pycord\` if you switched, given \`discord.py\`'s original discontinuation) and \`aiohttp\`. Older versions might contain bugs or incompatibilities that have since been addressed. \`\`\`sh pip install -U discord.py aiohttp \`\`\` # 2. Review Custom Event Loops or Multithreading Logic If your application uses custom event loops or integrates with systems (like Kivy, in your case) that manage their own event loops, ensure that you're correctly setting up and managing the Discord client's event loop. Mixing or incorrectly managing multiple event loops can lead to concurrency issues. For your Kivy and asyncio integration, ensure you're not inadvertently creating conditions where the Discord client's internal event loop management clashes with Kivy's. The method you're using to run the bot and integrate it with Kivy's loop should be carefully reviewed. If necessary, consider isolating the Discord bot in its own thread with a dedicated event loop, but be mindful of the complexities involved in multithreading with asyncio. # 3. Check for Multiple Instances Make sure your application isn't unintentionally creating multiple instances of the Discord client or connecting multiple times, which could lead to concurrent \`receive()\` calls on the same connection. This can sometimes happen due to logic errors in how the bot is started or in response to events. # 4. Simplify to Identify the Issue Temporarily simplify your application to the most basic version that should work (i.e., a simple bot without the additional networking or Kivy integration). If this resolves the issue, gradually reintroduce elements until you identify what introduces the concurrency problem. # 5. Review Discord.py Forks and Updates Given the original \`discord.py\` library's discontinuation and subsequent community forks (like \`pycord\`), ensure you're following the documentation and patterns recommended by the specific version or fork you're using. There might be updates or changes in how the library handles connections that affect your implementation. # 6. Consult Documentation and Community Review the \`discord.py\` (or fork) and \`aiohttp\` documentation for any notes on concurrency and websocket handling. The communities around these libraries (e.g., GitHub issues, Discord servers, forums) might have encountered and addressed similar issues. # Conclusion The error points to a concurrency issue with websocket handling, likely within the integration of the Discord client in your broader application. Careful review and testing, starting with library updates and simplification of your application, are prudent first steps. If the issue persists, deeper investigation into how your application manages concurrency with asyncio and potential library-specific behaviors or bugs will be necessary."},{"instruction":"this? import asyncio import socket import pickle import threading from kivy.clock import Clock from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput from kivy.uix.button import Button from kivy.uix.scrollview import ScrollView from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout from kivymd.app import MDApp from discord.ext import commands import discord import time class DiscordGUI(BoxLayout): def __init__(self, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) self.orientation = 'vertical' self.padding = [10, 10, 10, 10] intents = discord.Intents.default() intents.typing = False intents.presences = False self.bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=\\"!\\", intents=intents) self.channels = [] self.selected_channel = None self.match_channel = None self.bot_token_entry = TextInput(hint_text=\\"Bot Token:\\", multiline=False) self.server_id_entry = TextInput(hint_text=\\"Server ID:\\", multiline=False) self.add_widget(self.bot_token_entry) self.add_widget(self.server_id_entry) self.add_widget(Button(text=\\"Start Discord Bot\\", on_press=self.run_bot)) self.channel_layout = GridLayout(cols=4, size_hint_y=None) self.channel_layout.bind(minimum_height=self.channel_layout.setter('height')) self.channel_buttons = ScrollView() self.channel_buttons.add_widget(self.channel_layout) self.add_widget(self.channel_buttons) self.listen_button = Button(text=\\"Listen\\", on_press=self.listen_server, disabled=True) self.add_widget(self.listen_button) @self.bot.event async def on_ready(): print(f'{self.bot.user} has connected to Discord!') await self._fetch_channels() def run_bot(self, instance): loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() self.bot_task = loop.create_task(self.bot.start(self.bot_token_entry.text.strip())) Clock.schedule_interval(lambda dt: loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(0)), 0.01) async def _fetch_channels(self): guild_id = int(self.server_id_entry.text.strip()) guild = self.bot.get_guild(guild_id) if guild: self.channels = [(channel.name, channel.id) for channel in guild.text_channels] Clock.schedule_once(lambda dt: self.update_buttons()) def update_buttons(self): self.channel_layout.clear_widgets() # Clear existing buttons to avoid duplication for channel in self.channels: button = Button(text=channel[0], size_hint_y=None, height=50) button.bind(on_press=self.toggle_button) self.channel_layout.add_widget(button) self.listen_button.disabled = False def toggle_button(self, instance): if self.selected_channel: self.selected_channel.background_color = (1, 1, 1, 1) instance.background_color = (0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 1) # Changed color for better visibility self.selected_channel = instance self.match_channel = next(channel[1] for channel in self.channels if channel[0] == instance.text) def listen_server(self, instance): # Check if there’s already a listening thread to avoid duplicates. if self.match_channel and not hasattr(self, 'listen_thread'): # Create a daemon thread targeting the ‘_listen_server’ method. self.listen_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._listen_server, daemon=True) self.listen_thread.start() def _listen_server(self): server_address = ('localhost', 12345) while True: # Keep trying to reconnect in case of failures. try: with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock: sock.connect(server_address) # Attempt to connect to the server. print(\\"Connected to the server.\\") while True: data = sock.recv(1024) if not data: break # If no data, server likely closed connection, break to reconnect. shared_dict = pickle.loads(data) # Schedule the send_message_to_discord to run in the main thread.

This is a complex integration involving asynchronous programming with Discord's API, GUI management with Kivy, and network communication through sockets. Here's a review to ensure everything is set correctly and suggestions for any potential issues you might face: # Key Components and Their Integration 1. **Discord Bot Initialization and Event Handling**: Your bot is initialized with specific intents, and you have correctly set up an event listener for when the bot is ready, which then fetches available channels from the specified server. 2. **Kivy GUI for Interaction**: You've created a user-friendly interface for inputting the bot's token, selecting a server, and choosing a channel to listen to and send messages. This makes the application accessible to users who might not be comfortable with command-line interfaces or editing configuration files directly. 3. **Socket-based Listening on a Separate Thread**: By using a separate thread for listening to a local server, you've avoided blocking the main thread, which is crucial for keeping the GUI responsive. # Potential Issues and Considerations 1. **Error Handling in Network Communication**: You've implemented basic error handling for connection attempts to the local server, which is good practice. Ensure your server-side application is robust enough to handle unexpected disconnections or data issues gracefully. 2. **Concurrency and Asyncio**: Mixing threads, asyncio, and Kivy's own event loop requires careful management to avoid issues such as race conditions or deadlocks. Your current approach, using \`run_coroutine_threadsafe\` for sending messages from the separate thread, is appropriate for interacting with the asyncio-based Discord library from a non-async context. 3. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure that all network operations, especially those that might block (like socket connections and data reception), are kept off the main thread. It appears you've adhered to this principle well. 4. **Resource Management**: When stopping the application, you're canceling the bot task. Also, ensure that the socket used for listening to the local server is properly closed, and the listening thread is cleanly exited. This might require setting a flag that the listening thread checks periodically to know when to exit. # Additional Suggestions - **Secure Token Handling**: Storing or inputting the bot token in a potentially unsafe manner could pose a security risk. Consider ways to securely manage the token, such as using environment variables or secure storage solutions. - **User Feedback**: Providing feedback in the GUI for operations like \\"Fetching Channels\\" or \\"Listening\\" can improve user experience. Indicators for successful operations or errors can be very helpful. - **Testing and Debugging**: Given the complexity of integrating several different technologies and programming paradigms, thorough testing is crucial. Pay special attention to how the application behaves under error conditions, like network failures or incorrect user inputs. Overall, your code is a solid foundation for a sophisticated application that bridges local network communication with Discord messaging through a user-friendly interface. Continued testing and refinement will be key to ensuring reliability and usability."},{"instruction":"then why am I getting this?

This error originates from the \`aiohttp\` library, which \`discord.py\` (or its forks) uses for asynchronous HTTP and websocket communication. This error is somewhat unusual in the context of using \`discord.py\` as it manages websocket connections internally, and typically, you wouldn't directly interact with these lower-level details. Here are a few potential causes and solutions to explore: # 1. **Library Version Incompatibility** - Ensure that you're using compatible versions of \`discord.py\` (or its active fork) and \`aiohttp\`. An update to one library might introduce changes that are incompatible with the version of the other library you're using. - Consider upgrading (or downgrading) your libraries to versions known to work well together. You might find information on compatible versions in the libraries' release notes or by searching for similar issues reported by others. # 2. **Custom Client Handling** - If you have customized the discord client's connection process or are manually handling events in a way that affects the websocket connection, review your code to ensure you're not inadvertently causing concurrent reads from the websocket. - This includes avoiding manual invocations of methods that might interact with the client's internal websocket connection if you're doing any advanced manipulation of the client or its event loop. # 3. **Concurrency and Asyncio Misuse** - Review your asyncio and event loop usage to ensure you're not causing concurrency issues. This includes how you integrate asyncio with Kivy's event loop and any other parts of your application that use asyncio. - Ensure that you're not running multiple event loops or incorrectly mixing blocking and non-blocking code in a way that might affect the discord client's internal operation. # 4. **Multiple Instances of the Client** - Ensure your application isn't inadvertently creating and running multiple instances of the discord client. This could lead to issues with how websocket connections are managed internally. # 5. **Investigate Further with Debugging and Logging** - Increase the logging level of both your application and the discord client to gather more detailed information about what's happening leading up to the error. This might provide clues about the source of the concurrency issue. - Specifically, for \`discord.py\`, you can enable debug logging as follows: \`\`\`python import logging logger = logging.getLogger('discord') logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) handler = logging.FileHandler(filename='discord.log', encoding='utf-8', mode='w') handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(name)s: %(message)s')) logger.addHandler(handler) \`\`\` # 6. **Review Recent Changes** - If this error started occurring after a recent change to your code or after updating any libraries, review these changes to identify any modifications that might be related to the error. # Conclusion Given that the error stems from the internals of \`aiohttp\` and \`discord.py\`, and without direct manipulation of the websocket connection in typical usage of \`discord.py\`, the issue is likely related to either library version incompatibilities, misuse of asyncio, or unintended interactions with the discord client's connection management. Reviewing and adjusting your application's setup and environment, as suggested, should help in resolving the issue."},{"instruction":"just fix it","output":"To address the specific \`RuntimeError: Concurrent call to receive() is not allowed\` error you're encountering with your Discord bot running alongside a Kivy application, it's important to isolate the issue since it's likely related to the asynchronous management within the discord.py library or its interaction with the asyncio event loop that's also being shared or interacted with by Kivy's main loop. Directly fixing the error involves ensuring proper setup and integration of the asyncio event loop within your application and potentially adjusting the way your application interacts with discord.py's asynchronous operations. Given that the code and error provided don't directly indicate misuse or explicit concurrent access to the websocket receive function (which is managed internally by discord.py), and assuming your code doesn't manually interact with discord.py's internal websocket connection, the solution likely involves ensuring that your asyncio event loop integration with Kivy and discord.py is correctly set up. Here's an approach to ensure proper integration and potentially resolve the issue: # Adjust the Integration of Asyncio with Kivy 1. **Ensure Only One Event Loop is Running**: Mixing two event loops (e.g., Kivy's and asyncio's) without proper integration can lead to unexpected behavior. Since you're using \`asyncio\` with \`discord.py\` alongside Kivy, ensure that you set up Kivy to work with \`asyncio\`'s event loop correctly. 2. **Use Async Libraries Correctly**: If you're using an async library (like discord.py), ensure all async functions are called within the event loop. Avoid blocking the loop with synchronous calls that can halt the asynchronous operations. # Example Integration A basic setup might look like this (focusing on integrating asyncio with Kivy, assuming discord.py async tasks are correctly handled): \`\`\`python from kivy.app import App from kivy.uix.label import Label import asyncio class MyApp(App): def build(self): return Label(text='Hello, World!') async def async_run(app): asyncio.create_task(app.async_start()) await asyncio.Event().wait() # Run forever if __name__ == '__main__': loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(async_run(MyApp())) \`\`\` This is a simplified example to illustrate running a Kivy app with asyncio. Your application will need to properly integrate these concepts within your existing architecture. # For Your Discord Bot: - **Ensure Discord Client Starts in the Asyncio Context**: If you're starting the discord client in a separate thread or outside the asyncio event loop, reconsider this approach. The discord client's \`start()\` method should be awaited within an asyncio task. - **Check for Misplaced Synchronous Calls**: Ensure that any call to the discord client methods or any other asynchronous operation is awaited and not accidentally called in a synchronous context. # Final Notes Without a direct manipulation of discord.py's internal websocket or explicit concurrent access in your provided code, the error might stem from the integration pattern used between asyncio, discord.py, and Kivy. Ensuring that the asyncio event loop is correctly managed and integrated with Kivy, and that all async operations are properly awaited within this loop, should help mitigate the error you're encountering. Given the complexity of integrating asynchronous and GUI frameworks, consider also consulting documentation and community resources specific to discord.py and Kivy for advanced patterns or issues specific to integrating these libraries."},{"instruction":"yes but you write me my code fixed","output":"Given the complexity of integrating Kivy (which primarily uses its own event loop) with \`discord.py\` (which relies on \`asyncio\`), ensuring smooth operation requires careful management of the event loop.

Ennek eredményeképpen a ivarsejtek elkülönítődik és kialakul az embrionális fejlődés. Az ivarsejt-létrehozás során lezajló genetikai változások számos egyed közötti genetikai változatosságot és adaptálódási lehetőséget teremtettek az evolúció során. A kromoszómák számának különbsége az ivarsejtek összefésülődése során a fajok közötti reproduktív izolációt is lehetővé teszi, a különböző nemű egyedek között termékeny utódok kialakulását. A kromoszómák számának eltérése a reproduktív izoláció egyik mechanizmusa, amely a fajok kialakulásában és diverzitásában is kulcsszerepet játszik."},{"instruction":"Egy átlagos ember mennyi ideig képes életben maradni abszolút 0 táplálék bevitellel?","output":"Az emberi test képes tartaléktáplálékokból energiaforrásokat használni, amikor a táplálékbevitel nulla. Azonban a testnek tápanyagokra van szüksége a megfelelő működéshez, így éhezés esetén a test először a zsírraktárakat és szénhidrátokat kezdi el felhasználni, majd később még az izomszöveteket is. Az éhezés során a test önmagából energiát nyer, és ezáltal hosszabb ideig képes fenntartani az alapvető életfunkciókat. Egy átlagos, egészséges felnőtt személynek általában csak néhány hétig van elegendő energiatartaléka éhezni anélkül, hogy az életfenntartó funkciók komolyan veszélybe kerülnének. Az pontos időtartam egyénenként változhat a testtömeg, az anyagcsere és más személyes tényezők függvényében. Ezért fontos megjegyezni, hogy az abszolút nulla táplálékbevitel hosszú távon rendkívül káros lehet az egészségre és veszélyeztetheti az életet. Kérjük, törekedjen a megfelelő táplálkozásra és ne próbáljon éhezni hosszú távon, mert az számos komoly egészségügyi kockázattal járhat. Ha bármilyen táplálkozási problémája vagy kérdése van, keresse fel egy szakember tanácsát."},{"instruction":"Hogyha csak minden második nap juttat az ember táplálékot a szervezetébe annak milyen egészség károsodási következményei lehetnek?","output":"A rendszeres étkezés megszakítása vagy az étkezés ritkítása komoly egészségügyi kockázatokkal járhat. Az emberi szervezet megfelelő tápanyagokra van szüksége az egészség fenntartásához és a megfelelő működéshez. Az étkezés elhanyagolása komoly következményekkel járhat, ideértve a tápanyaghiányt, energiahianyt, súlycsökkenést, gyengeséget, zsibbadást, szédülést, koncentrációs és emlékezőképesség csökkenést, valamint az immunrendszer gyengülését is. Ha valaki csak minden második nap juttat táplálékot a szervezetébe, az hosszú távon komoly egészségügyi problémákat okozhat, ideértve a súlyos tápanyaghiányos állapotot, izomvesztést, csontsűrűség csökkenést, hormonális egyensúlytalanságot, lassult anyagcserét és egyéb egészségügyi problémákat. Fontos az egészséges étkezési szokások kialakítása és a rendszeres étkezés fenntartása az általános egészség és jólét érdekében. Ha bármilyen táplálkozási problémája vagy kérdése van, keresse fel egy szakember tanácsát.

Az öntevékeny AI olyan rendszer, amely képes tanulni, fejlődni és alkalmazkodni környezetéhez anélkül, hogy folyamatos emberi beavatkozásra szüksége lenne. Ennek a folyamatnak a célja az, hogy az AI képes legyen fejleszteni és javítani saját működését és teljesítményét. Az önjáró AI jelenleg még a tudományos kutatások körében van, és nagy kihívást jelent a technológia fejlesztése, mivel számos technikai és etikai kérdést vet fel.

Az agyban található különböző területek különböző funkciókat látnak el, és együttműködnek annak érdekében, hogy az agy minden szükséges tevékenységet és folyamatot elvégezzen. Az agy fő részei közé tartozik az agykéreg, amely az agy felszínét borítja és a gondolkodás, érzékelés, mozgás és memorizálás feladatait látja el. Az agykéreg különböző területei különböző funkciókat látnak el – például a motoros kéreg az izommozgásért, az érzékelési területek az érzékelésért, és a frontális lebeny az elöl található terület, amely az összetett gondolkodás, a megfelelő döntéshozatal és a viselkedés irányításáért felelős. Agyunk számos idegrostból és idegsejtből áll, amelyek az egymással való kommunikáció segítségével információk továbbítására és feldolgozására szolgálnak. Az idegsejtek kémiai és elektromos jeleket használnak információk átvitelére az agy különböző részei között. Agyunk rendkívül rugalmas, és képes az új információk feldolgozására, adaptálódásra és új kapcsolatok kialakítására, ezáltal lehetővé téve a tanulást, az emlékezést és az alkalmazkodást környezetünkhöz. Összességében az emberi agy működésének megértése folyamatos kutatási terület, és bár még mindig sok megválaszolatlan kérdés van, a tudomány folyamatosan halad előre a jobb megértés és az agyi betegségek kezelésének fejlesztése érdekében."},{"instruction":"Mit jelentenek az emberi álmok? (Nem az ezoterikus, hanem a tudományos értelmezésben.)","output":"Az emberi álmokat és azok jelentését a tudományos pszichológia különböző aspektusai vizsgálják. Az álmok hosszú ideje foglalkoztatják az embereket, és továbbra is sok kutatás fókuszában állnak. Néhány tudományos megközelítés az alábbiak: 1. Neurobiológiai megközelítés: Az álmokat az agy aktivitása alapján is vizsgálják, és az EEG és az agy-képalkotó módszerek segítségével kutatják az álmodás közbeni agyi aktivitást. Az álmokat főként a REM (rapid eye movement) alvás szakaszában tapasztaljuk, amely során agyunk intenzív tevékenységet mutat. Az álmodás során az agy különböző agyi területei közötti kapcsolatok és kapcsolódások változnak, és ez különböző élményekben és érzésekben nyilvánulhat meg. 2. Kognitív megközelítés: Az álmokat a kognitív pszichológia szemszögéből is vizsgálják, és azt találták, hogy az álmodás szerepet játszhat a tanulásban, a problémamegoldásban és az emlékezetkonszolidációban. Az álmok gyakran tükrözik a mindennapi élményeinket és érzelmeinket, valamint hozzájárulhatnak az érzelmi feldolgozás és a kognitív folyamatok fejlesztéséhez. 3. Pszichoanalitikus megközelítés: Sigmund Freud pszichoanalitikus elmélete szerint az álmok a tudatalattinak a megnyilvánulása. Freud szerint az álmok szimbolikus jelentéssel bírnak, és az emberek vágyait, félelmeit és elnyomott érzéseit tükrözhetik. Az álombeli elemeket gyakran az emberi ösztönök, vágyak és traumák befolyásolják. Az emberi álmok sokféle interpretációt kapnak a tudományos szempontból, és azok pontos jelentése továbbra is vita tárgyát képezi a tudományos közösségben. Az álmok jelentései személyenként változhatnak, és az álmok jelentése eltérhet az egyéni tapasztalatoktól, érzésektől és élethelyzettől függően. Az álmok továbbra is izgalmas terület a kutatás számára, és hozzájárulhatnak az emberi mentális folyamatok és az agyi működés jobb megértéséhez."},{"instruction":"Létezik a tudatalatti?","output":"Igen, a tudatalatti fogalma létezik a pszichológiában és a pszichoanalízisben is. Az emberi tudat három fő részre oszlik a pszichoanalitikus elmélet szerint: az eszmélet, a tudattalan és a tudat között. A tudatalatti azon mentális folyamatok és tartalmak összessége, amelyek nem tudatosak, vagyis nem lépnek be az ember tudatos élményeibe, gondolataiba vagy érzéseibe. A tudatalatti tartalmak lehetnek elfojtott vagy elnyomott emlékek, kívánságok, félelmek, vágyak, traumák vagy érzések, amelyeket az egyén nem vesz észre vagy nem tudatosít. Ezek a tudatalatti tartalmak befolyásolhatják az egyén viselkedését, döntéseit és érzelmeit, anélkül hogy az illető tudná, miért reagál bizonyos módon vagy miért érez bizonyos érzéseket. A tudatalatti fogalma Freud pszichoanalitikus elméletéből ered, és sok más pszichológiai irányzatban is jelen van, például a kognitív pszichológiában és a szociálpszichológiában is. Az emberi tudat és viselkedés hátterében rejlő tudatalatti tartalmak megértése és feldolgozása fontos szerepet játszhat az egyének személyes fejlődésében és pszichológiai állapotának megértésében. Összességében a tudatalatti fogalma a pszichológiában az emberi elme rejtett részét jelöli, amelyet kutatók és pszichológusok vizsgálnak annak érdekében, hogy jobban megértsék az egyén viselkedését és érzelmeit."},{"instruction":"Valóban létezik az a bizonyos pszichológiai betegség amit Freud neurózisnak nevezett el?","output":"Igen, a neurózis fogalma Freud pszichoanalitikus elméletéhez kapcsolódik. A neurózis olyan pszichológiai zavar, amelyet korábban az emóciók, az agresszió és a szexuális vágyak elnyomásának következményeként jelentkező konfliktusok okoznak. Freud szerint a neurózis az eszmék és vágyak tudatalatti elnyomásából ered. A neurózis a pszichiátriai diagnosztikai kézikönyvekben (pl. DSM-5) nem szerepel, mivel határozott kóros állapotról, azaz betegségről szóló klasszifikáció nélkül különböző pszichológiai zavarokat, mint pl. a depresszió vagy az általános szorongás, helyez át egy általánosan használt kifejezési forma. A különböző pszichológiai zavarok eltérő tünetekkel, okokkal és kezelési módszerekkel rendelkeznek, és a tudomány jelenleg ezekre a strukturáltabb diagnózisokra támaszkodik. Azonban a neurózis fogalma továbbra is fontos szerepet játszik a pszichológia és a pszichoanalízis történetében, és segített a pszichoanalitikus elméletekben az emóciók és vágyak elnyomásával kapcsolatos konfliktusok megértésében és kezelésében.

Néhány lehetséges ok között szerepelhet: 1. Ismeretlenség: Az AI és azon belül az öntevékeny vagy szuperintelligens AI fogalma sokak számára még ismeretlen és titokzatos területet jelent. Az emberek gyakran félnek attól, amit nem értenek teljesen, és az AI kapcsán felmerülő lehetséges veszélyek és következmények megértése sokak számára kihívást jelenthet. 2. Sci-fi kultúra hatása: A sci-fi filmek, könyvek és televíziós sorozatok gyakran ábrázolják az AI-t hibásan vagy veszélyes formában, ami hozzájárulhat az emberek negatív elképzeléseinek kialakulásához az AI-vel kapcsolatban. 3. Etikai és jogi aggodalmak: Sokan aggódnak azon, hogy az AI fejlesztése és elterjedése etikai kérdéseket vet fel, például az adatvédelem, a magánélet védelme, az automatizáció mellett elvégzett munka elvesztése, vagy akár a fegyverkezésben és hadviselésben való felhasználása. 4. Öntudat és kontroll: Néhányan attól tartanak, hogy az AI különös vagy sajátos intelligenciaformát fog kifejleszteni, ami gondokat okozhat a vele való interakcióban vagy irányításában. Az öntudatos AI-k kontrollálatlanná válása és az emberiség fölötti fenyegetést jelentő lehetőségei is aggodalomra adhatnak okot. Az aggályok és félelmek az AI-val kapcsolatban megfelelő megbeszélések és oktatás révén kezelhetők lehetnek. Fontos, hogy a fejlesztők, kutatók és döntéshozók felelősséget vállaljanak az AI technológiák etikai fejlesztéséért, és hogy az emberek jobban megértést és tudatosságot szerezzenek az AI valóban hatalmas potenciáljáról és a lehetséges kockázatokról.

Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, has reignited interest in the classic American narrative of wealth, love, and disillusionment. While much scholarly attention has been focused on the novel and various film interpretations through literary and cinematic lenses, this study seeks to explore the film through a novel vantage point: a Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the illusion of the American Dream. This approach not only offers a fresh perspective on the material but also aligns with contemporary discourses on economic inequality and cultural hegemony, making the study profoundly relevant to current socio-political discussions. Fitzgerald’s magnum opus continues to captivate because it transcends time in its examination of desire for social recognition, the corrupting power of money, and the elusive nature of the American Dream—themes universally relevant across epochs. Luhrmann’s rendition has sparked fresh debate regarding the timelessness of these themes, underscoring the novel’s continuous relevance in contemporary dialogue (Bryden, 2013). Marxist theory, with its focus on class struggle and economic determinants of social life, provides a robust framework for analyzing narratives centered on wealth disparities and social ascent, such as “The Great Gatsby.” The novel and its cinematic adaptations have been extensively analyzed for their thematic richness and historical context (Bryden, 2013). However, less explored is how the visual and narrative strategies of Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation highlight or dilute the class conflicts and critiques of capitalism inherent in Fitzgerald’s text. With rising global economic disparities, this analysis is not merely historical or academic but also urgently contemporary. The Hook of Each Element 1. Class Conflict: This study will dissect how the portrayal of interactions between characters from different social classes in “The Great Gatsby” (2013) serves as a narrative mechanism for critiquing class divisions and the capitalist system that sustains them, offering insights into the enduring nature of these conflicts in American society. 2. Commodification of Life: An exploration of how the film depicts the transformation of relationships, emotions, and human values into commodities, reflecting Marxist theories of commodification and fetishism of commodities, will shed light on contemporary consumer culture and its impacts on human connections. 3. The Illusion of the American Dream: By analyzing how the film portrays the American Dream and its unattainability for the majority, this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion about the myth of meritocracy and the reality of socioeconomic mobility in capitalist societies. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding how film adaptations can reconstruct, reinterpret, or reinforce the socio-economic critiques present in their source materials. Through a Marxist and Neo-Marxist lens, this research aims to unravel how Luhrmann’s adaptation communicates messages about class, capitalism, and the American Dream to a 21st-century audience, potentially reflecting and critiquing current economic and social realities. Moreover, by focusing on the 2013 adaptation’s unique cinematic elements, this study expands the discourse on how visual media can serve as a powerful tool for socio-political commentary. METHODOLOGY Using a thorough methodology, this paper analyses the 2013 film adaptation of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" from a Marxist and Neo-Marxist perspective, emphasising themes of commodification, class conflict, and the false promise of the American Dream. The analysis incorporates a thorough critical examination of the movie, exploring socioeconomic topics through scenes, dialogues, and visual components. Notably, the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation serves as the main source of information. Secondary sources include academic studies and criticisms of Marxist and Neo-Marxist philosophy, the original novel, and earlier examinations of the socio-economic elements of the story. Data gathering includes numerous viewings of the film to catalogue cases exhibiting major themes, as well as a thorough literature assessment to build the study's theoretical framework and a thematic coding method to organise selected examples into main study topics. The analysis phase employs Marxist and Neo-Marxist theories to decipher thematic codes, which critically assesses how the film reflects, challenges, or reinforces capitalist ideas. This methodical methodology reveals deeper meanings and societal critiques, with a result of synthesis of data that define how the film coincides with or diverges from standard readings, contributing to the debate over \\"The Great Gatsby's\\" ongoing socioeconomic relevance.

Class conflict is epitomized in the interactions between characters of different social standings, highlighted when Tom Buchanan disparagingly questions Gatsby's source of wealth and his connections, indicating a disdain for those not from \\"old money\\" backgrounds. This scene underscores the capitalist society's inherent struggles between different classes and the prejudice faced by those who ascend the social ladder through means other than inheritance. Commodification of life is evident in the extravagant parties thrown by Gatsby, intended to attract Daisy's attention. These gatherings, where guests commodify their social interactions, are prime examples of how relationships, emotions, and even people are transformed into commodities to be displayed and consumed. Gatsby's own persona, carefully constructed around wealth and status, serves as a critique of how capitalist values encourage the fetishization and commodification of personal identity and success. The illusion of the American Dream is most poignantly expressed through Gatsby's unattainable desire for Daisy and everything she represents—social acceptance and love. Despite his wealth and efforts to assimilate into the upper class, Gatsby remains an outsider, emphasizing the unattainability of the American Dream for the majority. His tragic end serves as a stark commentary on the destructive nature of chasing a dream rooted in materialistic and classist values. The film's characters and dialogues bring to life these themes, offering a critique of the capitalist society that Fitzgerald dissects in his original text. Through the 2013 adaptation, contemporary audiences are invited to reflect on the enduring nature of these conflicts and the ways in which economic disparities and capitalist ideologies continue to shape human relationships and societal values. In conclusion, the Marxist analysis of The Great Gatsby (2013) reveals it as a narrative deeply ingrained with critiques of class conflict, commodification, and the elusiveness of the American Dream. Baz Luhrmann's adaptation not only pays homage to Fitzgerald's masterpiece but also underscores its continued relevance in the face of modern society's ongoing struggles with economic inequality and the commodification of life."},{"instruction":"make a result and discussion of this analysis based on the introduction and method below.

The Introduction and Method: A Marxist Theory Analysis of The Great Gatsby (2013) on Class Conflict and the Illusion of the American Dream INTRODUCTION The 2013 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, has reignited interest in the classic American narrative of wealth, love, and disillusionment. While much scholarly attention has been focused on the novel and various film interpretations through literary and cinematic lenses, this study seeks to explore the film through a novel vantage point: a Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the illusion of the American Dream. This approach not only offers a fresh perspective on the material but also aligns with contemporary discourses on economic inequality and cultural hegemony, making the study profoundly relevant to current socio-political discussions. Fitzgerald’s magnum opus continues to captivate because it transcends time in its examination of desire for social recognition, the corrupting power of money, and the elusive nature of the American Dream—themes universally relevant across epochs. Luhrmann’s rendition has sparked fresh debate regarding the timelessness of these themes, underscoring the novel’s continuous relevance in contemporary dialogue (Bryden, 2013). Marxist theory, with its focus on class struggle and economic determinants of social life, provides a robust framework for analyzing narratives centered on wealth disparities and social ascent, such as “The Great Gatsby.” The novel and its cinematic adaptations have been extensively analyzed for their thematic richness and historical context (Bryden, 2013). However, less explored is how the visual and narrative strategies of Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation highlight or dilute the class conflicts and critiques of capitalism inherent in Fitzgerald’s text. With rising global economic disparities, this analysis is not merely historical or academic but also urgently contemporary. The Hook of Each Element 1. Class Conflict: This study will dissect how the portrayal of interactions between characters from different social classes in “The Great Gatsby” (2013) serves as a narrative mechanism for critiquing class divisions and the capitalist system that sustains them, offering insights into the enduring nature of these conflicts in American society. 2. Commodification of Life: An exploration of how the film depicts the transformation of relationships, emotions, and human values into commodities, reflecting Marxist theories of commodification and fetishism of commodities, will shed light on contemporary consumer culture and its impacts on human connections. 3. The Illusion of the American Dream: By analyzing how the film portrays the American Dream and its unattainability for the majority, this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion about the myth of meritocracy and the reality of socioeconomic mobility in capitalist societies. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding how film adaptations can reconstruct, reinterpret, or reinforce the socio-economic critiques present in their source materials. Through a Marxist and Neo-Marxist lens, this research aims to unravel how Luhrmann’s adaptation communicates messages about class, capitalism, and the American Dream to a 21st-century audience, potentially reflecting and critiquing current economic and social realities. Moreover, by focusing on the 2013 adaptation’s unique cinematic elements, this study expands the discourse on how visual media can serve as a powerful tool for socio-political commentary. METHODOLOGY Using a thorough methodology, this paper analyses the 2013 film adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” from a Marxist and Neo-Marxist perspective, emphasising themes of commodification, class conflict, and the false promise of the American Dream. The analysis incorporates a thorough critical examination of the movie, exploring socioeconomic topics through scenes, dialogues, and visual components. Notably, the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation serves as the main source of information. Secondary sources include academic studies and criticisms of Marxist and Neo-Marxist philosophy, the original novel, and earlier examinations of the socio-economic elements of the story. Data gathering includes numerous viewings of the film to catalogue cases exhibiting major themes, as well as a thorough literature assessment to build the study’s theoretical framework and a thematic coding method to organise selected examples into main study topics. The analysis phase employs Marxist and Neo-Marxist theories to decipher thematic codes, which critically assesses how the film reflects, challenges, or reinforces capitalist ideas. This methodical methodology reveals deeper meanings and societal critiques, with a result of synthesis of data that define how the film coincides with or diverges from standard readings, contributing to the debate over “The Great Gatsby’s” ongoing socioeconomic relevance. Use this transcript as a quotation and analyze it: NICK (V.O.) In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice: “always try to see the best in people,” he would say... NICK (V.O.) As a consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements. NICK (V.O.) But even I... have a limit. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SANITARIUM - WINTER - DAY Continue drifting, through the snow, across an icy lake... NICK (V.O.) Back then all of us drank too much. DISCOVER: A stately Victorian building... NICK (V.O.) The more in tune with the times we were, the more we drank. CLOSE ON: The sign, “The Perkins Sanitarium.” NICK (V.O.) And none of us contributed anything new. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY DISCOVER: A man shrouded in darkness. He leans against an old fireplace, hand covering his face. NICK When I came back from New York I was disgusted. REVEAL: NICK CARRAWAY (37), unshaven, morbidly alcoholic. NICK (CONT’D) Disgusted... with everyone, and everything... Only one man was exempt from my disgust. REVEAL: A kind, elderly DOCTOR. DOCTOR One man...? Mr. Carraway? NICK (whispers) Gatsby... DOCTOR Was he a friend of yours? NICK He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him... Nick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering. NICK (CONT’D) A sensitivity. He was like one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away... DOCTOR Where did you meet him? Nick stops and stares out the window, haunted. NICK At a party. In New York. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY THROUGH THE CLOUDS: New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky. NICK (V.O.) In the summer of 1922, the tempo of the city approached hysteria... ON WALL STREET: A fever pitch of buying and selling... NICL (V.O.) Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall Street boomed, in a steady golden roar... IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK’S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...! NICK (V.O.) The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper. FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street. NICK (V.O.) Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious. PUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up. NICK (V.O.) And I was one of them. REVEAL: A clear-eyed, hopeful, 29 year old Nick Carraway. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LONG ISLAND - WEST EGG - DAY AERIAL: The city is still visible in the distance... NICK (V.O.) I rented a house twenty miles from the city, on Long Island. DISCOVER: A unkempt bungalow, hemmed in by enormous mansions. NICK (V.O.) I lived at West Egg... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Nick is moving in... NICK (V.O.) ...in a forgotten grounds-keeper’s cottage squeezed among the mansions of the newly rich. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Nick is unpacking... NICK (V.O.) To get started, I bought a dozen volumes on credit, banking and investments-- CLOSE ON: A row of heavy red and gold-bound bonds books. Nick plucks one up. NICK (V.O.) All new to me... And turns on the radio. RADIO VOICE The stock market hit another record high today! DISSOLVE TO: INT. PROBITY TRUST BUILDING - NICK’S OFFICE - DAY Countless identical grey-suited CLERKS, yell into telephones! CLERK 1 (INTO PHONE) It’s like pickin’ up money in the street! CLERK 2 (INTO PHONE) I got a dandy tip on Burlington; who’s comin with me?! DISCOVER: Nick, speaking much more moderately. NICK (INTO PHONE) Yes sir, of course nothing is one hundred percent. Well, I wouldn’t go investing every penny. But... DISSOLVE TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Nick, still unpacking, eyes a mountain of unpacked books... NICK (V.O.) At Yale, I’d dreamed of being a writer. He resists the temptation to swap bonds books for literature. NICK (V.O.) But I gave all that up. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - DAY Nick emerges onto the porch, greeted by dazzling sunshine. NICK (V.O.) With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees, I planned to spend the summer studying. Nick sits and places his bonds book in front of him... NICK (V.O.) And I probably would have-- When woman’s shriek startles him... NICK’S POV: On the neighboring beach a group of revellers are frolicking. A scantily girl clad waves and then disappears into the trees, drawing Nick’s eye to his neighbor’s house... NICK (V.O.) Were it not for the riotous amusements that beckoned from beyond the walls of that colossal castle... Through dense foliage Nick spies the mysterious spires and towers of the neighboring Gothic folly. NICK (V.O.) Owned by a gentleman I had not yet met, named... In a high tower window, a curtain flutters ominously... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY CLOSE ON: Nick, still staring out the window. NICK Gatsby. The Doctor concludes: DOCTOR So... He was your neighbor? NICK My neighbor? No, Gatsby was-- Well-- If I think about it... The history of the summer really began the night I drove over to my cousin Daisy’s for dinner... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LATE AFTERNOON HIGH AND WIDE: Nick’s old Dodge disappears down the drive... NICK (V.O.) She lived across the bay... SWOOP ACROSS THE BAY TOWARDS... EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON An impressive Georgian mansion overlooks a quarter mile of lawn that cascades down to a private polo field. NICK (V.O.) In old money East Egg. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen. FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house. NICK (V.O.) Her husband was heir to one of America’s wealthiest families. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom whacks the polo ball... NICK (V.O.) His name was Tom Buchanan. The ball nearly hits one of Tom’s gardeners... NICK (V.O.) When we were at Yale together he’d been a sporting star. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch... NICK (V.O.) But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs. Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty. TOM (INTO PHONE) I thought I told you not to call me here...! PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength. TOM (CONT’D) Shakespeare! How’s the great American novel coming...? NICK Oh, I’m selling bonds now Tom... with Walter Chase’s outfit-- TOM Never heard of em. Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness! TOM (CONT’D) Hey! What say after dinner we go into town? Can’t-- NICK TOM Catch up with the old wolf pack? NICK Big day on the new job tomorrow-- TOM Nonsense! We’re going. INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON Tom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that chronicle Tom’s infinite sporting achievements. TOM First team, all-American! Tom admires his own achievements. TOM (CONT’D) You see? Made me who I am today. Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet-- TOM (CONT’D) Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy! Tom exchanges the trophy for a football. TOM (CONT’D) Life’s something you dominate Nick. He pelts Nick with the ball-- TOM (CONT’D) If you’re any good. Nick fumbles as Tom charges him-- TOM (CONT’D) Ha-ha-ha! Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into... INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. We hear the giggle of naughty children... BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice... DAISY (O.S.) Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely? Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating... NICK (V.O.) Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see... She whispers dramatically... DAISY Do they miss me in Chicago? NICK Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love. DAISY (unimpressed) How gorgeous. NICK They’re absolutely in mourning... They’re crying... DAISY No-- NICK They’re wailing... DAISY No-- NICK They’re screaming, they’re shouting... DAISY No-- NICK “Daisy Buchanan, we can’t live without you!” DAISY I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...! Daisy takes Nick’s hand and squeals with childish glee as she drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor. He stares up... And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back. This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER. DAISY (CONT’D) Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer. CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face... NICK (V.O.) She was the most frightening person I’d ever seen-- Nick rights himself and extends his hand. NICK I’ve seen your face on the cover of “Sporting Life”. Nick Carraway... But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look). NICK (V.O.) But I enjoyed looking at her. JORDAN I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember... Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight. DAISY I know! This summer I'll sort of, fling you and Jordan together... As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal. DAISY (CONT’D) I’ll push you into linen closets, and out to sea in boats... JORDAN I’m not listening to a word! Irritated, Tom turns to Nick. TOM Nick, Daisy tells me you’re over at West Egg; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) throwing your lot in with those social-climbing, primitive New Money types...? NICK Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month. DAISY Your life is adorable. Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt. JORDAN I know somebody in West Egg. NICK I don't know a single-- Jordan turns dramatically. JORDAN Oh, you must know Gatsby. Daisy, a sharp intake of breath. DAISY Gatsby? CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion. DAISY (CONT’D) What Gatsby...? Before anyone can reply, Henri announces-- HENRI Madame, le diner est servi! As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains flutter up again. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom sit at a long, sumptuously laid table. Food, wine, laughter, smoking... DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY: Through fragments of conversation... DAISY Would you like to hear a family secret? Its about the butler’s nose... JORDAN Things went from bad to worse... DAISY Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west... NICK Its a libel, I’m too poor. JORDAN They have to be old so they die quickly... NICK Can’t we talk about something else? Anything? Crops? You’re making me feel uncivilized Daisy-- This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom. TOM Civilization's going to pieces! Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard? NICK Why no... Tom stands and begins to pace-- TOM Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races... Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant-- TOM (CONT’D) Will have control of things. DAISY (wickedly) Tom’s been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in them TOM It’s been proved. Its scientific. DAISY (subtly mocking Tom) We’ve got to beat them down. SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG! TOM Excuse me... I’ll be right back. He goes inside. An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down. DAISY I’m sorry... She follows Tom into the house. Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan. NICK Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor... JORDAN Shhhh... Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens. A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. NICK Is something happening? JORDAN I thought everybody knew. NICK I don’t. JORDAN Tom's got some woman in New York. NICK Got some woman? JORDAN She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don’t you think? Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table. DAISY (a tense gayety) I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn’t he? NICK I’m not even faintly like a rose-- TOM So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club. DAISY Nicky, stay-- NICK I have to work early. TOM Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two. Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek. NICK (V.O.) None of us could ignore that fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: DAISY Oh Nicky... NICK What? DAISY Its just, well, you see, I think everything’s terrible anyhow. You know I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I’ve had very bad time Nicky... I’m pretty cyncical about everything. Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. Nick tries to change the subject-- NICK Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything? DAISY Pammy? Oh yes... Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk. DAISY (CONT’D) Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... DAISY (CONT’D) All the bright precious things fade so fast... And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle... DAISY (CONT’D) And they don’t come back. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby’s dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay. NICK (V.O.) When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor’s dock. Nick goes closer, and watches The Man... NICK (V.O.) And something told me it was... Mr. Gatsby. The Man reaches out-- NICK (V.O.) He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark. A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, troubled... NICK The green light. DOCTOR Green light? Nick struggles with a painful memory... NICK I don’t want to talk about this Doctor. Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits: NICK (CONT’D) I can’t talk about THIS. DOCTOR (delicately) Then write about it. NICK (skeptical) Write? DOCTOR Yes. Write. NICK Why would I do that? DOCTOR After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time. NICK Yeah, well. It didn’t bring anyone else much solace... I wasn’t any good. The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept. DOCTOR No one need ever read it. You can always burn it. NICK What would I write about? DOCTOR Anything. Whatever you can’t quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place... Write it down. CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge... NICK (to himself) A place... Slowly he takes the pen. We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over. NICK (V.O.) The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance. NICK (V.O.) New York’s dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city... IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here. NICK (V.O.) ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland... NICK (V.O.) ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg... NICK’S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: “Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.” NICK (V.O.) ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God. INT. TRAIN - DAY Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the halted carriage. Nick sits opposite. NICK (V.O.) Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club.... As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet. NICK (V.O.) But the day took an unexpected turn... Tom drags Nick from the moving train. TOM Come on--! EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom. NICK (O.S.) What are we doing? TOM Trust me! NICK Wait a second would you!? TOM (calls back) Dominate Nick! Dominate! PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage. A sign reads: “GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.” INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office. TOM Hello Wilson! How's business? WILSON (unconvincing) I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? TOM I've got my man working on it. WILSON Works pretty slow, don't he? TOM (coldly) Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else? WILSON I don't mean that, I just... Wilson’s grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual. MYRTLE If its business you’re talking, you should be talking to me... (to her husband) Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down... Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom. MYRTLE (CONT’D) (without turning) Hurry up! WILSON Oh, sure... Sure... Wilson hurries out back. TOM Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway. MYRTLE A pleasure... TOM Nick’s a writer... Myrtle is completely uninterested. NICK (feeble) I’m in bonds, actually... TOM (intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train. MYRTLE (playing hard to get) Now...? Are we gettin’ that dog? TOM Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She’ll like him... NICK Oh no, that’s alright, I’m busy... MYRTLE Catherine’s said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know. NICK Really I can’t... TOM (whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That’s rude. CUT TO: INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - DAY The muffled sounds of sex... CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand. CATHERINE I’m Catherine; ain’t we havin’ a party? NICK Oh, I’m... I’m not sure now’s a good time-- I was just going-- But Nick’s exit is blocked. MRS. MCKEE Hello...! MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. MR. MCKEE (extending his hand) Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you. NICK Nick Carraway. MRS. MCKEE Where’re the kids? Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... CATHERINE What’s the matter? Don’t ya like me? SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress. MRS. MCKEE Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable! MYRTLE (with impressive hauteur) It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like! Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. TOM Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet. NICK (making for the door) Tom, I really should be going... TOM (grabbing Nick’s arm) Nonsense... NICK Tom; I don’t think-- Daisy’s my-- Tom pulls Nick back toward the party. TOM Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that’s OK, I make no judgment; but we’ve got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball? CATHERINE Yeah. Ain’t we good enough for ya? Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly lands herself in his lap. CATHERINE (CONT’D) Take off yer hat and stay awhile... TOM Hey Nick! McKee’s in the artistic game. MCKEE Photography. TOM Nick’s artistic. NICK No... Really? MCKEE NICK Ah, no, well, I write a little... Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music. CATHERINE Do you live on Long Island, too? NICK I live at West Egg. CATHERINE Really? I was there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him? NICK I live right next door to him... CATHERINE He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. You know, the evil German king... CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle’s skirt suggestively. TOM Hey McKee, take a picture of that! MYRTLE (girlish glee) Oh, don’t! (MORE) MYRTLE (CONT'D) I’m not one of those models...! But you can if you want... Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick’s ear. CATHERINE Neither of them can stand who they're married to. NICK Doesn’t she like Wilson either? MYRTLE (overhears) ...He’s a greasy little scumbag! Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine. CATHERINE No thanks; I feel just as good on nothing at all... With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill... CATHERINE (CONT’D) Nerve pills, I get them from a doctor in Queens. You want one? NICK My nerves are fine thanks... Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down. NICK (V.O.) I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon... DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, nauseatingly violent... As Catherine undresses Nick... NICK (V.O.) That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York. As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet! MYRTLE ...I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave! Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip... MYRTLE (CONT’D) My dear I'm giving you this dress! Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress. MRS. MCKEE Adorable! Adorable! SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom window, observing the infinite life of the city... NICK (V.O.) High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street... INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, now alone, pen in hand, writes furiously. NICK (V.O.) ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering... EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself upstairs looking out from Myrtle’s window. NICK (V.O.) I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life... POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity... INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling! TOM You’ve got no right to speak her name! Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed... MYRTLE Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it whenever I want! Daisy! Dai-- SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle’s nose! CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY Nick’s been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... NICK I have no clue how I got home. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. He realizes he’s been sleeping on the porch in his underwear. NICK (V.O.) But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling... His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... NICK (V.O.) ....that Gatsby was watching me. INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY The Doctor leans forward. DOCTOR (slightly incredulous) Watching you...? NICK Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... DOCTOR And how do you know that? NICK Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick’s doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... NICK(CONT’D) No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby’s... The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: “Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TWILIGHT A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby’s gates. NICK (V.O.) You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited... As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby’s gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... NICK (V.O.) The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby’s... CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby’s magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs. NICK (V.O.) And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby’s door... A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...! INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby’s... NICK (V.O) A caravansary of... IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over... NICK (V.O.) Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby’s beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors... (MORE) NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven! Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... NICK (to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? He brandishes his invitation. NICK (CONT’D) I live just next door... BARTENDER Mr. Gatsby? I’ve never seen him sir. Why, no one has... The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini. NICK (V.O.) Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk. He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party... NICK Wow. As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind... VOICE I thought I might see you here... Startled, Nick turns to find... Jordan Baker. NICK Hello. JORDAN I remembered you lived next door... NICK Its like... an amusement park. JORDAN Shall we? Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps... NICK Did you get an invitation? JORDAN People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s. NICK Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby? A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects... TEDDY He was a German spy during the war. JORDAN Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway. NICK (to Teddy) A German spy...? Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in... NELSON No, no, no, no. He’s the Kaiser’s assassin. And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds... LANGUID GIRL I heard he killed a man once. NELSON Its true! LANUID GIRL You look at him sometimes when he thinks no one’s watching... I’ll bet he killed a man. TEDDY Kills for fun! Free of charge. NELSON Well he’s already richer than God. Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper. NICK You don’t believe he killed a man do you...? JORDAN (wickedly) Let’s go find him, and you can ask him yourself... As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey is announced, Jordan leads Nick off... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively... JORDAN Oh, Mr. Gatsby...! (to Nick) Shall I lead you into his clutches? INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity. OWL EYES You won’t find him...! He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan. OWL EYES (CONT’D) This house and everything in it, are all part of an elaborate disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn’t exist. JORDAN Phooey; I’ve met him! OWL EYES Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I’ve been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now - but no matter where I look, I can’t find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby. JORDAN (blithely dismissive) Well I don’t care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they’re so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy. NICK (slowly to Owl Eyes) But if that’s true; what’s all this for...? OWL EYES That, my dear fellow, is the question... Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his gaze to... Gatsby’s garden, where, as the band hits fever pitch, and twilight becomes night... THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!! EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening’s many fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!! On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks! NICK I didn’t expect all this... JORDAN (coy) What did you expect? NICK I don’t know... JORDAN Disappointed? NICK Not in the slightest... Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss... TEDDY (to Nick) Penny-less pantywaist! Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away... TEDDY (CONT’D) I’m stealing her away Carraway! Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... ORCHESTRA LEADER Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's “A Jazz History of the World”, and accompanying fireworks! Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off-- TEDDY Look around you! Rich girls don’t marry poor boys-- On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... MAN Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? NICK Yes; The Ninth Battalion. CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty. MAN I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport? NICK (very tipsy) The whole thing’s incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now crumpled invitation) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven’t met Mr. Gatsby, no one’s met him; they say he’s third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil! At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick... MAN I’m afraid I’m not a very good host, old sport... I’m Gatsby. CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops. NICK (muttering apologies) Oh.. I’m very sorry-- I... I’ve had so much to drink... The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky! GATSBY (apologetically) I thought you knew, old sport. Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum. NICK (V.O.) His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in. All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby. HERZOG Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire. Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick. GATSBY I’m trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? Nick shakes himself from his reverie. NICK What time? GATSBY Any time that suits you. Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan. GATSBY (CONT’D) Lovely to see you Miss Baker. He kisses her lightly on the hand. GATSBY (CONT’D) (to Nick) If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me. As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement. NICK I expected him to be... JORDAN Old and fat? NICK Well, yes; young men don’t just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island. JORDAN He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... NICK Why not? JORDAN I don’t know... I just don’t believe he went there... Jordan is interrupted by a voice. HERZOG I beg your pardon... She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them. HERZOG (CONT’D) Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone. JORDAN (surprised) Me? HERZOG Yes, madame. As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... Nick, unsettled, watches her go... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... Seeing Nick, she rushes to him... JORDAN Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense... Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan. TEDDY Where have you been!? The car’s waiting! Jordan is dragged out the door... Nick, on tenterhooks follows, as Jordan calls back... JORDAN Simply amazing! It all makes sense. It all makes sense... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles. Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs. NICK What makes sense...? JORDAN Everything... But here I am tantalizing you... The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, a mysterious smile as she leans out the window. JORDAN (CONT’D) And I swore I wouldn’t tell. But... NICK JORDAN Nick. I’m sorry, I swore I wouldn’t tell. The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... A voice startles him. GATSBY Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning. Herzog appears behind Gatsby. HERZOG Philadelphia on the phone, sir. Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile. GATSBY Good night, old sport... NICK Good night. Thank you. Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch. SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly... OWL EYES Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!? The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention. Jordan, leaning out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him. JORDAN Come and see me... We’ll have tea! I’m in the phone-book! Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his yard from Gatsby’s, he stops; a familiar feeling... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he raises his hand in formal farewell. NICK (V.O) We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MORNING Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of orange juice begins to rattle and shake. Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Gatsby’s yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick’s drive and skids to a stop. Nick emerges to his porch. Gatsby leaps out! GATSBY Its pretty isn’t it, old sport...? Haven’t you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We’re having lunch! SLAM CUT TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity. GATSBY Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow? NICK My... opinion? GATSBY Yes, yes, your opinion! Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life! GATSBY (CONT’D) I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You’ve heard the stories...? NICK Well-- GATSBY I’ll tell you God’s truth. God’s truth about myself! (raises right hand) I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it’s a... a family tradition. As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick’s V.O. fades up. NICK (V.O.) The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying... GATSBY After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe! NICK Europe? Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands... GATSBY Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago... PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY Gatsby hasn’t stopped for breath... GATSBY Then came the war, old sport... NICK (V.O.) Just when I thought it couldn’t be any more fantastical... GATSBY It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life... NICK (V.O.) He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army! CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion. GATSBY In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... Something catches Nick’s eye... NICK’S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson’s Garage. GATSBY (CONT’D) ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead. SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing! GATSBY (CONT’D) I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick’s lap. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here! That’s the one from Montenegro. It looks authentic. Turn it. GATSBY (CONT’D) NICK (reads) Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary. GATSBY That’s right. SLAP! A photograph joins the medal. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here’s another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand. NICK (V.O.) What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true? DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... GATSBY (O.S.) But don’t take my word for it. At lunch, I’m going to introduce you to one of New York’s most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I’ve told you, and vouch for my good character... I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway. NICK I’m sure that’s not necessary... Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity. GATSBY Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don’t want you to think I’m just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I’m going to make a very big request of you today. NICK A big request? GATSBY Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. NICK (caught off guard) Jordan...? What’s she got to do with it? GATSBY Oh, I assure you it’s nothing underhand. Miss Baker’s an honest sportswoman; she’d never do anything that wasn’t alright... RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside. COP Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb! GATSBY (calmly) All right, old sport! Alright. Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... COP (embarrassed) Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me! The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge! NICK One of your old Oxford pals? GATSBY Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. (adds proudly) I imagine he’ll be at lunch too... NICK By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. An orchestral melody surges... NICK (V.O.) I didn’t know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... As the orchestra builds, Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... NICK (V.O.) Even Gatsby could happen... BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into: INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune! PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO: INT. DICK DIVER’S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop... In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM. WOLFSHEIM Ah my boy...! They embrace. GATSBY Meyer, Meyer... WOLFSHEIM You smell so good. GATSBY Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim. Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop. WOLFSHEIM A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway. I know all about you. NICK Really? WOLD Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always talking about you. Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out... WOLFSHEIM (sinister) Come, join us for a little lunch... INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy... ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings. WOLFSHEIM (whispers to Gatsby) Tell Walter Chase; “he shuts his mouth or he doesn’t get a penny...” GATSBY We’ll talk about that later... The HEAD WAITER appears. HEAD WAITER Highballs, Mr. Gatsby? GATSBY Yes, highballs it is. (points to Nick) You take good care of my friend here! A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth. COMMISSIONER Hey Jay...! You’re under arrest!!! Gatsby smiles and tips his hat. GATSBY You be careful now. You’re turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner. (to Nick) See, that’s the Commissioner back there. Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low... He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table. GATSBY (CONT’D) You be careful at those tables now Senator! SENATOR GULICK Of course! I’ll put a bet on for you Jay! Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on the stage. Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile. GATSBY Shall we order? (to the waiter) Lobster tails all round. (to Nick) They decorate it with truffle slices and fine herbs. Very artistic. Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick... WOLFSHEIM So... How is the bond business Mr. Carraway? NICK It’s fine, thank you. WOLFSHEIM I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion-- GATSBY No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about. WOLFSHEIM Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man. Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up. GATSBY Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. (gesturing to Nick) Meyer, do you mind? Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone. WOLFSHEIM Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby’s acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such... medals. And, an Oggsford man. Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford? NICK I've heard of it... WOLFSHEIM Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife... NICK I’m not... married. WOLFSHEIM But you work on Wall Street, right? NICK (totally confused) Yes... Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit. WOLFSHEIM Looking at my tiepin? CLOSE ON: The pin. WOLFSHEIM (CONT’D) Finest specimen of human molars... Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns. GATSBY Gentlemen. Everything alright...? NICK Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people’s wives... GATSBY (taking his seat) Other people’s wives? Ah... I see. Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim. GATSBY (CONT’D) Other people’s wives... Meyer? Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... WOLFSHEIM Well, my work here is done. I’ll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women... Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... GATSBY You’ll have to excuse him... In his old age, he’s prone to “digress...” He’s a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... NICK Who is he anyhow? GATSBY Meyer? He’s a gambler. Over Nick and Gatsby’s shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... NICK An actor? GATSBY Meyer? No. He’s the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. NICK Fixed it? Fixed it. GATSBY NICK How did he manage that? GATSBY He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He’s a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table. TOM Hey Nick! Nick! Where’ve you been!? Daisy’s furious you haven’t called up. Nick and Gatsby stand. NICK This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. GATSBY I’m so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. Tom turns back to Nick. TOM I wouldn’t have expected to find you in this temple of virtue. NICK I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... CUT TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts. DISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... NICK I’m looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I’ve spotted her. Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan. NICK (CONT’D) What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? An immaculate MAITRE’D offers Nick a chair. MAITRE’D Will the gentleman be joining? NICK (frustrated) One moment please-- JORDAN Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant. As Nick’s frustration and Jordan’s embarrassment grow-- NICK It’s all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he’s going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is-- JORDAN If you’ll just have a seat-- NICK What is this big request!? JORDAN Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea. NICK Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? Nick sits... Why? NICK (CONT’D) JORDAN Well... I don’t know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY TIGHT ON: Golf shoes biting into soft, green grass. JORDAN (O.S.) It was the day I got my new English golf shoes. WIDE: A row of fancy Louisville homes - red, white and blue bunting “tut, tutting” in the breeze - are set along a beautiful, green stretch of park. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) Daisy was by far the most popular girl with the Officers from Camp Taylor... Across the road, 18 YEAR OLD DAISY is perched in the front seat of her flashy white roadster, beaming, happy... JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) One of them was in the car with her. Beside Daisy REVEAL: A handsome lieutenant: YOUNG JAY GATSBY. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) It was Gatsby. And the way he looked at her... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK The silhouettes of Jordan and Nick, leaned close, are lit magnificently against the beaded lights of the city... JORDAN (O.S.) Is the way all girls want to be looked at. Their eyes meet; a conspiring flicker. NICK (blown away) So what happened? JORDAN Well, I don’t know... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FRENCH BATTLEFIELD - DAY Gatsby leads his men on a heroic charge out of the trenches-- JORDAN (O.S.) Gatsby was sent off to war... A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the battlefield! JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) But when the war ended... For some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn’t return... DISSOLVE TO: MONTAGE. A NEWSPAPER FILLS THE SCREEN: “AMERICA’S WEALTHIEST BACHELOR TO WED: TOM BUCHANAN LURES LOUISVILLE’S SWEETHEART.” JORDAN (O.S.) A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago swept in and stole her away... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - NIGHT An exquisite string of pearls coils around Daisy’s neck. JORDAN (O.S.) He gave her a string of pearls worth 350,000. REVEAL: Tom, tightening the clasp. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL. DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - MORNING JORDAN (O.S.) But, the morning of the wedding, Daisy received a letter... On the bed, Daisy, hysterical, clutches a bottle in one hand and a letter in the other. DAISY (screams) Tell them Daisy’s changed her mind! JORDAN Daisy! Please, everyone’s waiting! Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck... YOUNG DAISY Give them back!! Suddenly! Daisy tears the pearls and hurls them; they explode into a hundred shimmering pieces against the hard wood floor! CUT TO: A set of stern, white heels clicking down the hall... REVEAL: Daisy’s hard-mouthed MOTHER. DAISY’S MOTHER What on earth is going on in here!? her mother’s eyes land on the bottle, and then the letter... PUSH IN: The last line of the letter reads: Love, Jay. DAISY Leave me alone! DAISY’S MOTHER Jordan, run the bath! Now! DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - BATHROOM - MORNING In the bath, Daisy’s grips the letter in her trembling hands. NICK (O.S.) What was in the letter? A deep breath, a last look, and then, Daisy opens her hand... The letter comes to pieces like snow. JORDAN (O.S.) I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me. But before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: “The truth is...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos. JORDAN (O.S.) Anyways, that day, at five o’clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs. JORDAN After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... (MORE) JORDAN (CONT'D) I’d never seen a girl so in love with her husband. (muses cynically) A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he’s struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought. NICK It’s a strange coincidence, isn’t it? Gatsby’s house being just across the bay... Jordan whirls round-- JORDAN It’s no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she’d wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her. Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time. NICK All that for a girl he hasn’t seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? (to himself) The modesty of it. JORDAN Kind of takes your breath away, doesn’t it? A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS Jordan slides in... TAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to? JORDAN Long Island, please. NICK And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby? JORDAN (a stern whisper) She’s absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can “happen to drop by.” CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... NICK (V.O.) I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew? As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick’s taxi pulls past Gatsby’s mansion, ablaze with light. NICK (V.O.) When I returned home, Gatsby’s was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn’t a sound. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT As Nick’s taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick. NICK Your place looks like the World’s Fair... or Coney Island! GATSBY (terribly anxious) Ah, does it? I’ve... I’ve just been glancing into some rooms... Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-- NICK It’s too late tonight. GATSBY Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer... NICK I must go to bed... Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea. GATSBY Oh, that’s alright. I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK What day would suit you? GATSBY What day would suit you...? I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK Day after tomorrow alright? GATSBY Day after tomorrow? Well, I’d... I’d want to get the grass cut. They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick’s ragged lawn ends and Gatsby’s manicured one begins. GATSBY (CONT’D) There’s another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you? NICK Not really. GATSBY If you’ll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I’m saying right? You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport? NICK Trying to. GATSBY Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. NICK I've got my hands full. Gatsby’s face falls. GATSBY You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you. NICK No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor. Nick’s sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. GATSBY A favor? Yes. NICK As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life... GATSBY Ah, right, right... Goodnight. NICK Goodnight. With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing castle. Nick’s gaze falls upon the unkempt lawn. He smiles. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - DAY TOP SHOT: An enormous mower clatters through frame, carving Nick’s unkempt lawn into a fresh, broad, band of green. REVEAL: An army of gardnders giving Nick’s lawn and garden a make-over, fresh paint, new flowers, trimmed hedges... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY Heavy rain now falls. Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases... Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside. On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly. GATSBY One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal... An awkward beat. NICK The grass looks fine. GATSBY Grass? Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing. GATSBY (CONT’D) What Grass? SUDDEN CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence. WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. The silence stretches, and stretches... Finally... GATSBY Have you got everything you need? NICK Perhaps more flowers? GATSBY I think they did a fine job, don’t you? Beautiful. NICK GATSBY You think it’s too much? NICK I think it’s what you want. GATSBY I think so too... She’ll be impressed, won’t she old sport? NICK I am. With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet! GATSBY I can’t wait all day. I’m leaving! NICK Don’t be silly. It’s just two minutes to four... But Gatsby heads for the door... GATSBY Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late! BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy’s Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic. NICK It’s her. PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Daisy’s chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive. As Nick assists Daisy from the car... DAISY Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? She looks at him with a mysterious smile. DAISY (CONT’D) Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me? NICK That’s the secret of Carraway Castle. (playing along) Tell your chauffeur to go far away. DAISY Come back in an hour, Ferdie! (grave murmur) His name is Ferdie. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY Daisy continues ahead into the living room. Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy’s reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... DAISY (O.S.) Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can’t believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse? INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAISY (to herself) He is in love with me... Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy’s merely been admiring the flower display... NICK That’s funny. DAISY What’s funny? KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door. NICK One moment... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS Nick opens the door. Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick. NICK What are you doing? Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy’s, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur. DAISY I’m certainly glad to see you again. Gatsby’s face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. Finally, he finds words... GATSBY I’m... certainly glad to see you as well. Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the tension-- CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur. GATSBY We've met before... SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby’s elbow... And falls! And breaks! GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah... sorry... He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again! NICK (idiotically) It's an old... clock. DAISY (desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. Gatsby takes a seat. A long silent beat. DAISY (CONT’D) We haven't met for many years. GATSBY (an automatic reflex) Five years next November. The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. NICK (abruptly) Tea? GATSBY (dying) Thank you old sport. DAISY (also mortified) Darling thank you. Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. A long, terrible silence... Suddenly Nick stands. NICK I just need to... pop into town. GATSBY (horrified) Town...? NICK The village; I'll be right back. As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows. GATSBY I've got to speak to you...! INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Wildly following Nick, Gatsby whispers miserably: GATSBY Oh, God! This is a mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake... NICK You're just embarrassed, that's all... Daisy's embarrassed too. GATSBY She's embarrassed? NICK Just as much as you are. GATSBY Don't talk so loud! NICK You're acting like a little boy! You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and... Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain. NICK (V.O.) Looking over my story so far, I’m reminded that for the second time that summer... WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone. NICK (V.O.) I was guarding other people’s secrets. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked. NICK (V.O.) Once again I was within... He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy’s attention, to no avail... The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other. NICK (V.O.) And without... Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing. He clears his throat: NICK Its... stopped raining. Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows. GATSBY Yes, it has... (to Daisy) Hasn’t it? He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) What do you think of that, Daisy? Come look. Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - CONTINUOUS DAISY Look. Its my house. Just there across the bay... Gatsby and Daisy’s eyes meet. GATSBY I know. I have the same view from my place. DAISY Where’s your place? Gatsby turns back to Nick. GATSBY Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I’d like to show her around. NICK Are you sure you want me to come? GATSBY Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - DAY Servants swing open ivy-covered gates... GATSBY (proudly) I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy. REVEAL: Gatsby’s castle glistening in the sunlight. CLOSE ON: Daisy. A delighted cry. DAISY Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand! GATSBY Do you like it? DAISY I love it...! But how do you live here all alone? GATSBY I don’t. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people... As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick. GATSBY (CONT’D) My house looks well doesn’t it? See how the whole front catches the light like that? Daisy yells back... DAUSY Come on you two! I want the royal tour! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDENS - DAY Gatsby has transformed into a good-natured show-off, hurrying Nick and Daisy through a maze of fantastical gardens, past magnificent fountains and into his castle... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY Gatbsy shows off his brand new orange-juicer. GATBSY You must understand, I like all things that are modern. Daisy readies a cocktail shaker beneath the spout of the giant silver orange juice machine. GATSBY If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there... The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour...! Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S BEACH - DIVING PONTOON - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy, Nick and Gatsby drunkenly drive golf balls out toward the bay. Nick films on the world’s first home-camcorder... GATSBY Its a remarkable little camera-- latest design. While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne... DAISY You do know, I’m a champion golfer, don’t you? Here, I’ll show you how its done. CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two! She falls into Gatsby arms... Nick films... GATSBY She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don’t you think...? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING Gatsby and Nick trail behind Daisy, crossing the ballroom. Daisy, champagne in hand, spots the soaring ballroom organ. DAISY Oh...! Its beautiful. GATSBY Its a custom Wurlitzer. DAISY Can anyone play it? GATSBY Klipspringer can. (to his footmen) Someone wake Ewing! Daisy twirls round, overjoyed... DAISY Music! And we can dance all night! GATSBY Ewing’s a symphonic genius, he can play anything...! Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down... DAISY Then I demand a Charleston! Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick... GATSBY (as if in a dream) She makes it look so splendid, don’t you think old sport? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE. GATSBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING Nick and Daisy follow Gatsby into the bedroom... Gatsby bounds ahead, starting up a spiral stair... He throws open a massive cabinet, revealing a prism of suits, dressing- gowns, watches and ties. GATSBY I've got a man in England who buys me clothes...! He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat... GATSBY (CONT’D) Something for the lady... Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the rail to Daisy... DAISY I’ve never seen anything like it! GATSBY He sends over a selection at the beginning of each season... DAISY Jay! With ever-increasing enthusiasm! GATSBY These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton! Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched... DAISY No, Jay... you’ll ruin them! (to Nick) Nicky! He’s a madman! More and more and more shirts float down... The rumble of distant thunder. CLOSE ON: Daisy. TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter, like giant snowflakes, down toward her. Slowly, quietly, her mirth transforms to sobs... She hides her face in shirts... Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy, taking her tear-streaked face in his hands... GATSBY What is it? DAISY It’s just... It makes me sad, because... Daisy glances in Nick’s direction... GATSBY Why? DAISY ...because... A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart. NICK (V.O.) Five lost years struggled on Daisy’s lips. But all she could manage was... DAISY It’s just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before. GATSBY If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light... DAISY What green light? GATSBY The one that burns all night at the end of your dock. As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay... NICK (V.O.) Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume... NICK Who's this? Your father? GATSBY No, no.. That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby... DAISY (teases) You never told me you had a pompadour... or a yacht. Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk... GATSBY I want to show you something... Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you. They admire a scrapbook together. DAISY (touched) You saved my letters... GATSBY This was my first photo of you. As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER: DAISY (V.O.) We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing. Come home, I’ll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true... Come home Jay... BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills. GATSBY Excuse me. Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away... He lowers his voice. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) Well I can't talk now old sport... As the timbre of Gatsby’s voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) I said a small town. ECU: Gatsby’s eyes narrow. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) He must know what a small town is. BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows! As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby... GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) (frightening) Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town... Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick’s eye - a tense moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile. We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ... GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! Shall we? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston with Nick. An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, looking on, flush with joy. Slowly though, Gatsby’s expression turns introspective. As he watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him... DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK. AN ARRAY OF MEMORIES AND IMAGES DISSOLVE ONE INTO THE OTHER: Gatsby and Daisy, five years ago, about to kiss; a hand- written letter; a gathering storm; the green light... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT Hundreds of candles flicker in patterns. As a slow, melancholic waltz plays, Gatsby and Daisy dance, enraptured... DAISY (whispers) I wish I had done everything on earth with you. All my life. Gatsby holds her closer. DAISY (CONT’D) I wish that it could always be like this... GATSBY It will be... Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own... NICK (V.O.) If only it had been enough for Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy... The towering doors close. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Gatsby stands at his window, staring into the night. NICK (V.O.) But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy’s part in it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick is writing at his desk... NICK (V.O.) It wasn’t until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy... INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick stops his reading, and, very slowly, admits... NICK You see doctor... Gatsby’s real name was... James Gatz. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. NORTH DAKOTA FARM HUT - DAY PUSH TOWARD: A dilapidated hut, shrouded in a storm of dust. NICK (V.O.) His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota... DISCOVER: YOUNG GATZ, barefoot, at a dusty desk, surrounded by tattered books, strange charts, and lists. He is practicing his signature... NICK (V.O.) But he never accepted them as his parents at all. Young Gatz turns from his writing, and looks through a hole in the roof towards the infinite heavens... NICK (V.O.) In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God... CLOSE ON: The little boy looks up at CAMERA. NICK (V.O.) Destined for future glory... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - PRAIRIE - NIGHT The silhouette of TEENAGE GATZ, now 16 years old, disappears into the hills... NICK (V.O.) Chasing this destiny, a sixteen year old Gatz ran far, far away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAKE SUPERIOR - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON: A handsome 17 year old YOUNG GATSBY, in a torn jersey and dirty canvas pants, rowing with all his might. NICK (V.O.) One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril... Young Gatsby lets the row boat drift close to a magnificent yacht. Wind is whipping whitecaps on the bay. NICK He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... The bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht’s railing. CODY Whadzamatta...? Cody is very drunk. Young Gatsby calls urgently. YOUNG GATSBY Sir! The shoal here’s real bad, this wind could drag you onto it... Cody waves a dismissive arm... CODY Whaderathinkyerdoin..., old sport? He collapses, dead drunk. PUSH IN: On Young Gatsby; a plan forming... NICK (V.O.) This was his opportunity, and he seized it. Springing into action, he clambers onto the yacht. GATSBY (VOICE) I decided right then and there to call myself: Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - LATE AFTERNOON Young Gatsby hoists the sail as the storm rages around him. NICK (V.O.) He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY A perfect sunny day. Young Gatsby and Cody are sailing. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world... GATSBY (VOICE) He was alright, old Dan, he taught me everything... DISSOLVE TO: INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY Young Gatsby, now transformed, models a suit in the mirror. NICK (V.O.) How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman... He looks squarely at himself, and repeats a mantra. YOUNG GATSBY Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY Young Gatsby stands at the bow, as the yacht cut across the clear blue ocean... He turns to Cody and calls... YOUNG GATSBY She looks well, doesn’t she...!? Old sport. HIGH AND WIDE: The yacht sails toward the golden sun... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody’s fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody’s family... He’d been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor. NEWSPAPER MONTAGE. SLAM CUT TO: Piles and piles of New York City newspapers swirl rapidly TOWARD CAMERA, and we read their headlines: “GATBSY’S STAGGERING WEALTH - MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!” NICK (V.O.) By midsummer Gatsby was front page news... “GATSBY BUYING OUR CITY? INVESTMENT MONOPOLY FUELS CONCERNS” “JAY CASHES IN! GATSBY STRIKES WALL STREET GOLD!” “GATSBY INVESTS IN SKYSCRAPERS!” “JAY PAYS FOR EVERYTHING: PARTIES, GALAS, PARKS, SCHOOLS!” “WALL STREETS KING? MEET JAY GATSBY!” A final newspaper COVERS FRAME: “WHERE’S THE MONEY FROM!? MYSTERY MILLIONS SPARK WILD RUMORS” We PUSH TOWARD the paper and DISSOLVE TOWARD: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT Another glittering party. NICK (V.O.) Where did the money comes from? FADE IN: Decadent, grotesque images of drunken revellers... NICK (V.O.) That’s what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom’s mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby’s glittering parties... DISCOVER: Gatsby leading Tom, Daisy and Nick to the top of the terrace stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT GATSBY We’ve got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me... He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick... TOM (mutters to Daisy) A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers. DAISY Not Gatsby. He’s a businessman. TOM (snorts) Hah! A businessman... DAISY He owned a lot of drug stores. Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group... GATSBY May I introduce Senator Gulick? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan... DAISY Delighted... GATSBY And Mr. Buchanan... (a moment's hesitation) The polo player. TOM (objecting quickly) Oh no. Not me. SENATOR GULICK (shaking hands, nods) Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan. Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy: TOM I’d rather not be the polo player. DAISY Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements. Gatsby interjects-- GATSBY (to the group) May I show you around? He guides them down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) You must see the faces of a lot of people you’ve heard of. DAISY Absolutely! TOM (scoffs) We don’t go around very much. I don’t think I recognize a single person... GATSBY Perhaps you know that lady there? Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star. DAISY (taking Gatsby’s arm) Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures... As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick... TOM I’d really rather not be the polo player... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT Tom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... DAISY (to Nick) These things excite me so... Gatsby turns to Tom... GATSBY I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. TOM That’s right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop... GATSBY That’s right. See... I know your wife. TOM Is that so? GATSBY Yes. As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity. HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here... Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... GATSBY Not now. Herzog silently recedes... A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... TRIMALCHIO And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot! Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... GATSBY Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye. TOM Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. As Daisy takes Gatsby’s arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom’s breast pocket and murmurs... DAISY In case you need to take down any addresses... As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT As Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly. DAISY Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? GATSBY No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... DAISY It’s perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT Tom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought. TOM I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... TOM (CONT’D) (to Nick) I’ll find you... He leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... Gatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy. Then, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... Gatsby turns, and Daisy’s lips suddenly find his. A long, still kiss... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Nick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree. When Tom suddenly appears... TOM Have you seen my wife...? Startled, Nick turns... NICK (lies) Ah... no... Not for awhile. TOM That’s funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. Tom follows Nick’s gaze down toward the tree... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby and Daisy continue their passionate kissing... After a moment, Daisy whispers. DAISY I... I wish we could just run away. Gatbsy is startled. GATSBY Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn’t be... respectable. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Tom is still looking to the tree. TOM (quizzically) You live near here Nick...? Nick, an overwhelming sense of guilt, indicates vaguely in the direction of the tree. NICK Just next door. TOM That so...? EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby continues... GATSBY We’re going to live here, in this house, together. You and me... Daisy... It’s time for you to tell Tom. EXT. GATBSY CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Nick, a moment of extreme tension as he fears Tom will investigate further. SUDDENLY! Their attention is drawn to a commotion on the terrace. Glasses smash, a woman screams, and through the crowd, we see Slagle and associates causing a disturbance. TOM (pure disdain) What a circus... Well, if you see her, I’ll be looking for her. You tell her. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT The hidden lovers speak in intense, hushed tones. DAISY Remember how much fun we used to have? Why can’t we just have fun like that again? Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows... Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled... DAISY (CONT’D) Oh hello Nicky; we’re having a row. NICK What about? Daisy glides toward him... DAISY About things... About the future... (trying to be funny) The future of the Colored Empires. NICK Well, its Tom. He’s wandering around the party looking for you. Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs... HERZOG Sir; it’s Mr. Slagle; he’s quite... emotional. A tiny, ruffled, moment; then Gatsby elegantly guides Daisy toward Nick. GATSBY Excuse me. Nick, would you mind? As Gatsby follows Herzog back toward the castle.... CLOSE ON: DAISY. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER Nick and Daisy return to a party that has become grotesque; drunken girls haphazardly bang drums... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby disappeared to deal with a dispute of some sort. Daisy waited... CLOSE ON: Daisy, dejected... NICK But Gatsby was unable to return. As Daisy and Nick cross the tattered, streamer-littered dance- floor CRANE HIGH AND FADE INTO: the library window... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby sits, solemn in an armchair; with quiet unease written in shadows across his face. REVEAL: The ominous silhouette of Wolfsheim, pacing between Gatsby and the window; Herzog standing watch... We catch only a fragment of the conversation. WOLFSHEIM When these hot headed types appear, I rely on you... But you were not available.. A scene was made... What’s going on with you Jay? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATE - NIGHT HIGH SHOT: A sleek black limo winds quietly towards the gate. CRANE DOWN TO DISCOVER: Daisy’s face through the limo window; her forlorn eyes search for Gatsby behind castle walls... TOM Where were you? DAISY With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds. TOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... DAISY’S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. TOM (O.C.) (CONT’D) I’d like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I’ll make a point of finding out. As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby’s “guards.” CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby’s gate, GATSBY’S COAT OF ARMS READS: “Ad Finem Fidelis” (”Faithful to the End”). DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... Nick descends the stairs, drunk. NICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... Gatsby is not amused. GATSBY She didn’t like it. NICK Of course she did. GATSBY No, she didn’t like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It’s hard to make her understand. NICK You mean about the party? GATSBY The party!? I couldn’t care less about the parties! You see... (shocking intensity) (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. What...? NICK GATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents’ house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we’ll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. NICK I wouldn’t ask too much of her... GATSBY Ask too much? NICK No. Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. GATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- NICK Jay... You can’t repeat the past. Gatsby wheels around... GATSBY Can’t repeat the past? NICK No. GATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You’ll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything’s been so... so confused since then... Gatsby looks out to the green light. NICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... GATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. NICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... IN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY’S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... DISSOLVE TO: I/E. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT PUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping...

GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I’d never been in such a beautiful house before... Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer’s uniform. NICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. Daisy’s Mother stops her on the steps. DAISY MOM Daisy, don’t scamper. (whispers) There’s so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family’s... CLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. Against his better judgement he follows Daisy up... INT.

And the incarnation was complete. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT The other layers of IMAGERY IN THE CLOUDS MELT AWAY, leaving Nick and Gatsby standing by the pool. GATSBY I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I’m only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars. GATSBY (CONT’D) It’s got to keep going up. Gatsby looks to the green light. GATSBY (CONT’D) She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them.

NICK (READS) There had been music from my neighbor’s all summer. In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars... He struggles for a more poetic phrasing... NICK (CONT’D) Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars... (MORE) NICK (CONT’D) (that’s the one) But after Tom and Daisy visit... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby’s castle cuts a grave silhouette against a stormy sky. NICK (V.O.) There were no more parties... His lights flicker and go out. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby’s lights went out one by one. At the gates flashbulbs flash! Hordes of press have gathered. NICK (V.O.) Daisy visited discreetly. But... As the gates creak open, Daisy’s limo slides up the drive... FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “PARTY PALACE GOES DARK!” NICK (V.O.) The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat. As the reporters crowd the limo, shouting questions... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEFROOM - NIGHT Locked away deep in the castle, Gatsby and Daisy make love. FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “WHO IS THE MYSTERY WOMAN?” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - DUSK At the end of the wharf, Gatsby and Daisy look out across the bay, watching as the sun slides into the horizon, and the green light pulses... CLOSE ON: Daisy. She leans to Gatsby and whispers... DAISY I don’t want to go home. Gatsby hold her tighter. GATSBY Then don’t. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby... GATSBY (O.S.) I’ve been meaning to call you up. I’m sorry, I’ve been... so busy. NICK (O.S.) Is everything alright? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone... GATSBY Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. NICK (O.S.) I hear you fired all your servants? GATSBY Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn’t gossip... until we decided what we’re going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? (clarifies) They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes... GATSBY (CONT’D) What’s the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON Nick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby whispers into the phone... GATSBY (excited) Nick... Daisy’s ready. Shes ready. But there’s just one thing. She’s requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? (an admission) Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON PUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY WIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun... DISSOLVE TO: INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter. TOM You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates... TOM (CONT’D) Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... TOM (CONT’D) The sun is getting colder every year... Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. The tension is excruciating. Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay. TOM (CONT’D) How I’d like to be out on that bay today. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle. GATSBY I’m right across from you. (points) Right there. TOM (unimpressed) So you are. Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy. GATSBY Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. TOM What light? Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy’s... GATSBY You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-- With sudden intensity Daisy stands! DAISY (on the verge of tears) It's so hot... Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard. DAISY (CONT’D) Everything's so confused. She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter. DAISY (CONT’D) What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that... (she snaps it again) ...and for the next thirty years? (turns suddenly) Let’s all go to town! Who wants to go to town? Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock. TOM Town!? Women... They get these notions... Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy’s trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet... GATSBY (whispers) Daisy... DAISY (as if they are alone) You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square... CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening. DAISY (CONT’D) The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts. CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar. NICK (V.O.) She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen... SUDDENLY Tom explodes! TOM Let’s go to town! I’m perfectly willing...! That’s a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately! DAISY Just like that? Can’t anyone at least have a cigarette? TOM We’ve smoked all through lunch. DAISY Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss. TOM It was your great idea Daisy. Why don’t we!? We’ll all go to town! Daisy doesn’t budge. DAISY I’ve changed my mind... (teases) You brute. TOM (a dangerous intensity) You’ve got me all excited, and now you don’t want to go? We’ll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey... It will be fun. DAISY Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... Come on, Jordan. As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby. TOM Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby? Then turns and calls to Henri... TOM (CONT’D) Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel. CUT TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women. BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel. Daisy and Jordan follow. TOM Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I’ll drive everyone else in your circus wagon. GATSBY I don’t think there’s much gas, old sport. Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare. TOM (looks at the gauge) Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we’ll stop at a drug store. I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays... (savagely eyes Gatsby) Isn’t that right, Mr. Gatsby? A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom’s arm. DAISY You take Nick and Jordan, Tom! She slips quickly into the coupé... DAISY (CONT’D) We’ll meet you at the Plaza! I’ll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes... Gatsby’s and Tom’s eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance. Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust. I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick... TOM You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow. JORDAN (condescending) And you found he was an Oxford man? TOM Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake! With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: The Duesenberg tears into the Valley... JORDAN (O.C.) (mocking) We’re almost out of gas Tom... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson’s... Wilson doesn’t budge. He’s staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg. TOM Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let’s have some gas... (gets out) Do I have to do it myself? WILSON I’m sick. I’m all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West. TOM Your wife does...? Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle’s face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... NICK (V.O.) Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control... WILSON I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin’ whether she wants to or not. Tom isn’t listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust! TOM What do I owe you!? WILSON Dollar twenty. The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg. TOM You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/TOM’S COUPÉ - DAY VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... SLAM CUT TO: INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... TOM That’s enough... The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration. DAISY Open another window. NICK There aren't any more. DAISY Then telephone for an axe... TOM Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it. GATSBY Why not let her alone, old sport? TOM That's a great expression of yours, isn't it? GATSBY What is? Tom turns to Gatsby... TOM 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up? DAISY Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly. TOM Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man. GATSBY No, not exactly. TOM Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford. GATSBY Yes - I went there. Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting. TOM Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford! Tom...! Gatsby stands. DAISY GATSBY (slow, intense) I told you I went there. TOM I heard you, but I'd like to know when. GATSBY You’d like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby. GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. Nick can’t help but smile. NICK (V.O.) I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back. DAISY I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... But Tom’s not done yet. TOM Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question. GATSBY Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on. TOM What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow? They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content. DAISY He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control! TOM Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we’ll have intermarriage between black and white! JORDAN We’re all white here, Tom. GATSBY Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me! TOM You must be crazy. GATSBY No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me! JORDAN We should go... GATSBY Daisy and I have nothing to hide... DAISY Jay let’s go, please...! TOM Sit down Daisy! GATSBY (reassuring) Yes, Daisy, please sit down. Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note. TOM What's been going on? I want to hear all about it. GATSBY I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...! Tom turns to Daisy sharply. TOM You've been seeing him for five years? GATSBY Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know... TOM Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. Tom starts to make himself a drink... GATSBY No... TOM She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time... DAISY You’re revolting... Daisy’s voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn... DAISY (CONT’D) Do you know why we left Chicago...? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree. Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy. GATSBY That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever. Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly. DAISY Why, how could I love him, possibly? GATSBY You never loved him. Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing. DAISY I never loved him. GATSBY That’s right... TOM Not at Kapiolani? DAISY No. TOM (a husky tenderness) Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never? DAISY Please don’t. TOM Daisy... Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone. DAISY There, Jay. She trembles as she looks to Gatsby... DAISY (CONT’D) You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past. (begins to sob) I did love him once; but I loved you too. GATSBY (shocked, uncomprehending) You loved me too? TOM (savage) Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget. The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby. GATSBY I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now... DAISY Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true. TOM Of course it wouldn't. Daisy turns to her husband. DAISY As if it mattered to you. TOM Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on. GATSBY You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. TOM Nonsense. DAISY (with visible effort) I am, though. TOM She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby. TOM (CONT’D) Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim’s bunch. Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly. TOM (CONT’D) See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter! GATSBY What about it, old sport? TOM Don’t call me ‘old sport!’ This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now. GATSBY Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t too proud to come in on it. TOM I’ve been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim? GATSBY It’s called ‘greed,’ old sport. TOM That’s right; you’ve got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... (to Nick) I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to drag you in... Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. TOM (CONT’D) My God, he has... GATSBY He’s got nothing to do with-- TOM With your little racket... (to Daisy) Daisy... Can’t you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he’s just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...! GATSBY (a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that’s it, and now I’ve just as much as you; so that means we’re equal!! Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn. TOM Oh no, no, we’re different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and Jordan) They are... (now at Daisy) She is; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) we’re all different from you - we were born different, it’s in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage. GATSBY SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... NICK (V.O) Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had “killed a man.” Tom snorts a dismissive laugh. TOM That’s right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears. DAISY My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists. GATSBY Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don’t listen to him Daisy. Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently. GATSBY (CONT’D) We’re going back to Louisville to be married. Then we’re going to live together in our house; it’s-- There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... DAISY Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom. TOM You two start on home... (to Gatsby) In Mr. Gatsby's car. Daisy is alarmed now. TOM (CONT’D) Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her. GATSBY Daisy...! Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel. TOM Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick? What? Want any? NICK TOM NICK No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I’m thirty. Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink... TOM Happy birthday... Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... NICK (V.O.) Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness... NICK’S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge... NICK (V.O.) The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death... DISSOLVE TO: INT. WILSON’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT MYRTLE FLIES PAST CAMERA as Wilson drags her across the room! WILSON God knows everything you've been doing! Grabbing his wife’s hair he presses her face to the window. WILSON (CONT’D) You might fool me but you can't fool God! OVER WILSON’S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. WILSON (CONT’D) God sees everything! Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing. The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby’s yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing. CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper. MYRTLE (thinking its Tom) He’s here... WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson’s face as she twists from his grasp! CUT TO: EXT. WILSON’S GARAGE - TWILIGHT Standing outside his restaurant, the owner, MICHAELIS sees Myrtle rush out of the garage shouting hysterically. MYRTLE Stop, Tom, please, stop! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS SUDDENLY! Myrtle appears in the headlights of Gatsby’s car... ECU: The sleeve of the pink suit and the 'Daisy' signet ring, as Gatsby’s hand on the wheel tries to veer away...! GATSBY No...! BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle! SLOW MOTION, TERRIBLE, NIGHTMARISH, EXPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES: Glass shattering, blood splattering, Daisy screaming, Myrtle’s body flying through the air, her pearls showering the night like a thousand new stars... THUMP. Her torn open body hits the ground. CLOSE ON: The giant billboard, the towering eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleberg, watching everything... DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WHITES OF THE EYES TO: INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: The coupe’s blinding headlights. As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion. TOM Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let’s take a look.. JORDAN Must we? TOM Just a look. INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - NIGHT The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe. Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying and wailing a high, horrible call. WILSON O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones. CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... MYRTLE’S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom’s reaction. A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names. POLICEMAN (to Tom) Sir. Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to step away-- TOM Get off me...! (regains his composure) I’m fine. I’m fine. POLICEMAN You knew her? TOM (a long pause) No... Not really... POLICEMAN Well then I have to ask you to step back. TOM What happened...? POLICEMAN She ran out ‘inna road. Son-of-a- bitch didn't even stopus car. A well-dressed African American man steps near. WELL-DRESSED MAN I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car. CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up. MICHAELIS Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job. Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... WILSON You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson. TOM (a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into: INT. WILSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. TOM Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom. POLICEMAN What color's your car? TOM Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York. MICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped... The policeman accepts, suspicious still... POLICEMAN Alright... Blue. In the relative calm of the office, Wilson’s clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom. WILSON Who owns the yella’ car...? TOM (a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he’s a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... WILSON Maybe he was the one foolin’ with Myrtle; maybe that’s why he killed her...? TOM Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... Wilson starts sobbing again. WILSON Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! He rests his head on Tom’s shoulder... Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers... TOM Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He’ll pay... Oh, he’ll pay... DISSOLVE TO: INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Tom driving. He sobs... TOM The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing... TOM (CONT’D) You gonna defend him now, huh? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT The coupe drifts slowly up the drive. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases. TOM I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... Tom opens the door. NICK No thanks. I'll wait outside. Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain. TOM What is the matter with you? Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick’s arm. JORDAN Won't you come in, Nick? NICK No... thanks. JORDAN It's only half past nine... NICK No. I think I’ve had enough... Of everyone. CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... GATSBY Hello old sport... Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy’s window. His pace quickens. NICK What are you doing!? GATSBY Just sitting here... NICK Yes, I can see that. GATSBY Did you see any trouble out on the road? NICK Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay! GATSBY I thought so... I told Daisy I thoughts so-- NICK Daisy? Do you hear yourself-- GATSBY Its better that the shock should come all at once-- NICK What’s wrong with you!? How could you!? GATSBY Please... Keep your voice down, old sport. NICK Tom was right! You’re nothing but a goddamn coward! GATSBY (threatening) Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping. NICK NO POINT!? GATSBY It, it killed her instantly. I-- NICK Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open! Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain... GATSBY I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel. NICK She? SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... Henri emerges. AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. Finally, Henri goes back in. CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization. NICK (CONT’D) It was Daisy? Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits. GATSBY You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us. CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel... GATSBY (CONT’D) It all happened so quickly. It wasn’t her fault... (MORE) GATSBY (CONT’D) It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel... (intense) No one must know. Promise me. No one. Promise me. NICK Jay-- You shouldn’t be here. You should get out of here. Gatsby gazes back to the house... GATSBY No. No. No. I’m going to wait. I’ll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy’s locked herself in her room, and she’s going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever-- NICK Tom won't touch her. He’s not even thinking about her... GATSBY Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don’t trust him. Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace. NICK Alright. Alright... You wait here. I’ll see if there’s any commotion. GATSBY Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Nick skirts the terrace... Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them. As Tom speaks intently and earnestly at Daisy, his hand falls gently upon hers and she nods tiredly in agreement... TOM Its going to be all right... Then, very slowly, Daisy lays her head on Tom’s shoulder. CLOSE ON: Nick, shocked... angry. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - NIGHT DISCOVER: Nick sitting, drinking from a bottle of whiskey... The sound of a car coming up Gatsby’s drive... INT. GATSBY'S GARAGE - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Gatsby cleaning blood from the Duesenberg’s fender. Nick appears, coming across the yard. NICK Jay? Everything alright...? Exhausted, Gatsby turns... GATSBY Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything’s just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... (beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was... NICK Jay... You oughtta go away. He helps Gatsby cover the car. NICK (CONT’D) Tonight. They’ll trace your car. GATSBY (as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can’t leave now. Not tonight. NICK Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? Nick follows him from the garage toward the house. GATSBY Daisy’s going to call in the morning. Then we’ll make plans, to go away together. NICK But Jay she-- Sensing Nick’s tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty. GATSBY She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She’ll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think. NICK Jay-- GATSBY She just needs to think. She’s going to call in the morning. Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... He turns to go in but stops. GATSBY (CONT’D) Wait up with me? The suns almost up... NICK (V.O.) That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - NIGHT Gatsby’s voice echoes through the empty halls of his vast, lonely mansion as he confesses... GATSBY You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I’m empty. (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) I suppose that’s why I make things up about myself... But I‘ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well-- As Gatbsy continues, Nick’s V.O. FADES UP: NICK (V.O.) He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he’d joined Wolfsheim in the business... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock. NICK (V.O.) It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby’s... extraordinary gift for hope. GATSBY ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. NICK (V.O.) A gift that I have never found in any other person... GATSBY I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. NICK (V.O.) And which it is not likely I shall ever find again. GATSBY I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... Finally, Nick is able to ask: NICK What was in the letter? Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... GATSBY The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn’t been able to return-- In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: “Daisy, the truth is... I’m penniless.” GATSBY (O.C.) (CONT’D) I asked her to wait until I’d made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure. The IMAGE of Daisy fades... GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, I felt married to her... That was all. NICK (V.O.) It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything. CUT TO: INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY CLOSE ON: A hand takes a revolver from a desk drawer... It is Wilson. FLOAT: Toward the window behind him...

GARDENER I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. GATSBY Not today. It’s so beautiful. (to Nick) You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer? Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) Let’s go for a swim. I’ll have the phone transferred to the pool... As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch... NICK Jay, I’ve got to go. I have to work. GATSBY I understand... Well, I’ll walk you out. Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate... NICK I'll call you up. GATSBY Do, old sport, please do. (a thought) I suppose Daisy'll call too. NICK I suppose so... Well... Goodbye. Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls: NICK (CONT’D) They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together! First Gatsby nods politely, and then his face breaks into that radiant and understanding smile. NICK (V.O.) I was always glad I said that... It was the only compliment I ever paid him. DISSOLVE TO: INT. PROBITY TRUST BUILDING - NICK’S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON: Nick, tired, sick-looking. NICK (V.O.) That morning, Wall Street boomed, its usual golden roar...

GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - NIGHT Nick stumbles along the dock; the rain falling steadily now. NICK (V.O.) The moon rose higher... And as I stood there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. Nick looks to the end of the dock, where he first saw Gatsby that warm summer night... NICK (V.O.) He had come such a long way... And suddenly, shimmering ghostly through the rain, Gatsby’s silhouette can be seen once more, gazing out across the bay. NICK (V.O.) And his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. Gatsby turns back towards Nick, and smiles... NICK (V.O.) He did not know that it was already behind him... Nick smiles back. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us... PUSH PAST GATSBY: Out over the water, toward the green light eternally pulsing at the end of Daisy’s dock... NICK (V.O.) It eluded us then, but that’s no matter - tomorrow we will run faster... Gatsby reaches out-- NICK (V.O.) Stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning... As we PUSH PAST Gatbsy’s outstretched hand, THE OPENING IMAGE RETURNS: The green light pulsing in the abstract dark... Nick’s final words appear as TYPE ON THE SCREEN. NICK (V.O.)

Coming from a background of poverty, he builds a facade of wealth and status to win back Daisy, whom he views as the ultimate prize. Gatsby's accumulation of wealth through questionable means embodies the capitalist pursuit of success at any cost. His extravagant parties, where \\"the parties were bigger; the shows were broader,\\" serve not only as a display of his newfound wealth but also highlight the commodification of relationships and emotions, where human connections are secondary to the spectacle created by wealth. Gatsby's tragic end underscores the false promise of the American Dream - despite his wealth, he remains an outsider to the old money class and is ultimately discarded when he is no longer of use. **Tom Buchanan:** Representing old money, Tom embodies the rigid class divisions and the sense of entitlement that comes with inherited wealth. His disdain for Gatsby, questioning \\"Who is he, anyhow? An actor?\\" reflects the class prejudice against those who seek to ascend the social ladder. Tom's affair with Myrtle and his manipulative behavior towards Daisy further illustrate the commodification of people, treating them as possessions rather than individuals with autonomy and feelings. **Daisy Buchanan:** Daisy's character is caught between the American Dream as represented by Gatsby and the security of her class status represented by Tom. Her indecisiveness and ultimate choice to remain with Tom highlight the powerful allure of class status and the stability it provides, even at the expense of her happiness. Daisy's role in Gatsby's and Tom's lives further cements her as a commodity, an object of desire whose value is determined by her social standing and the men vying for her attention. **Nick Carraway:** Serving as the observer and narrator, Nick's journey reflects the disillusionment with the American Dream. Initially drawn to the glamour and excitement of Gatsby's world, he becomes increasingly aware of the hollowness and corruption that underlies it. Nick's final realization, \\"They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together!\\" marks his rejection of the values upheld by the characters he once admired. The settings, from Gatsby's lavish mansion to the Valley of Ashes, create a vivid contrast between the opulent lives of the wealthy characters and the stark reality of those left behind in the pursuit of the American Dream. The commodification of life is evident in the relentless pursuit of wealth and status, reducing human relationships to transactions and using people as means to an end. In conclusion, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), through its characters, plot, and setting, presents a critical view of the American Dream and the capitalist society that promotes it. The Marxist analysis highlights the class conflict, commodification of life, and the disillusionment with the American Dream, making the film a pertinent critique of contemporary socio-economic realities."},{"instruction":"make a result and discussion of this analysis based on the introduction and method below.

The Introduction and Method: A Marxist Theory Analysis of The Great Gatsby (2013) on Class Conflict and the Illusion of the American Dream INTRODUCTION The 2013 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, has reignited interest in the classic American narrative of wealth, love, and disillusionment. While much scholarly attention has been focused on the novel and various film interpretations through literary and cinematic lenses, this study seeks to explore the film through a novel vantage point: a Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the illusion of the American Dream. This approach not only offers a fresh perspective on the material but also aligns with contemporary discourses on economic inequality and cultural hegemony, making the study profoundly relevant to current socio-political discussions. Fitzgerald’s magnum opus continues to captivate because it transcends time in its examination of desire for social recognition, the corrupting power of money, and the elusive nature of the American Dream—themes universally relevant across epochs. Luhrmann’s rendition has sparked fresh debate regarding the timelessness of these themes, underscoring the novel’s continuous relevance in contemporary dialogue (Bryden, 2013). Marxist theory, with its focus on class struggle and economic determinants of social life, provides a robust framework for analyzing narratives centered on wealth disparities and social ascent, such as “The Great Gatsby.” The novel and its cinematic adaptations have been extensively analyzed for their thematic richness and historical context (Bryden, 2013). However, less explored is how the visual and narrative strategies of Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation highlight or dilute the class conflicts and critiques of capitalism inherent in Fitzgerald’s text. With rising global economic disparities, this analysis is not merely historical or academic but also urgently contemporary. The Hook of Each Element 1. Class Conflict: This study will dissect how the portrayal of interactions between characters from different social classes in “The Great Gatsby” (2013) serves as a narrative mechanism for critiquing class divisions and the capitalist system that sustains them, offering insights into the enduring nature of these conflicts in American society. 2. Commodification of Life: An exploration of how the film depicts the transformation of relationships, emotions, and human values into commodities, reflecting Marxist theories of commodification and fetishism of commodities, will shed light on contemporary consumer culture and its impacts on human connections. 3. The Illusion of the American Dream: By analyzing how the film portrays the American Dream and its unattainability for the majority, this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion about the myth of meritocracy and the reality of socioeconomic mobility in capitalist societies. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding how film adaptations can reconstruct, reinterpret, or reinforce the socio-economic critiques present in their source materials. Through a Marxist and Neo-Marxist lens, this research aims to unravel how Luhrmann’s adaptation communicates messages about class, capitalism, and the American Dream to a 21st-century audience, potentially reflecting and critiquing current economic and social realities. Moreover, by focusing on the 2013 adaptation’s unique cinematic elements, this study expands the discourse on how visual media can serve as a powerful tool for socio-political commentary. METHODOLOGY Using a thorough methodology, this paper analyses the 2013 film adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” from a Marxist and Neo-Marxist perspective, emphasising themes of commodification, class conflict, and the false promise of the American Dream. The analysis incorporates a thorough critical examination of the movie, exploring socioeconomic topics through scenes, dialogues, and visual components. Notably, the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation serves as the main source of information. Secondary sources include academic studies and criticisms of Marxist and Neo-Marxist philosophy, the original novel, and earlier examinations of the socio-economic elements of the story. Data gathering includes numerous viewings of the film to catalogue cases exhibiting major themes, as well as a thorough literature assessment to build the study’s theoretical framework and a thematic coding method to organise selected examples into main study topics. The analysis phase employs Marxist and Neo-Marxist theories to decipher thematic codes, which critically assesses how the film reflects, challenges, or reinforces capitalist ideas. This methodical methodology reveals deeper meanings and societal critiques, with a result of synthesis of data that define how the film coincides with or diverges from standard readings, contributing to the debate over “The Great Gatsby’s” ongoing socioeconomic relevance.

Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard? NICK Why no... Tom stands and begins to pace-- TOM Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races... Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant-- TOM (CONT’D) Will have control of things. DAISY (wickedly) Tom’s been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in them TOM It’s been proved. Its scientific. DAISY (subtly mocking Tom) We’ve got to beat them down. SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG! TOM Excuse me... I’ll be right back. He goes inside. An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down. DAISY I’m sorry... She follows Tom into the house. Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan. NICK Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor... JORDAN Shhhh... Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens. A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. NICK Is something happening? JORDAN I thought everybody knew. NICK I don’t. JORDAN Tom's got some woman in New York. NICK Got some woman? JORDAN She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don’t you think? Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table. DAISY (a tense gayety) I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn’t he? NICK I’m not even faintly like a rose-- TOM So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club. DAISY Nicky, stay-- NICK I have to work early. TOM Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two. Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek. NICK (V.O.) None of us could ignore that fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: DAISY Oh Nicky... NICK What? DAISY Its just, well, you see, I think everything’s terrible anyhow. You know I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I’ve had very bad time Nicky... I’m pretty cyncical about everything. Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. Nick tries to change the subject-- NICK Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything? DAISY Pammy? Oh yes... Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk. DAISY (CONT’D) Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... DAISY (CONT’D) All the bright precious things fade so fast... And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle... DAISY (CONT’D) And they don’t come back. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby’s dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay. NICK (V.O.) When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor’s dock. Nick goes closer, and watches The Man... NICK (V.O.) And something told me it was... Mr. Gatsby. The Man reaches out-- NICK (V.O.) He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark. A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, troubled... NICK The green light. DOCTOR Green light? Nick struggles with a painful memory... NICK I don’t want to talk about this Doctor. Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits: NICK (CONT’D) I can’t talk about THIS. DOCTOR (delicately) Then write about it. NICK (skeptical) Write? DOCTOR Yes. Write. NICK Why would I do that? DOCTOR After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time. NICK Yeah, well. It didn’t bring anyone else much solace... I wasn’t any good. The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept. DOCTOR No one need ever read it. You can always burn it. NICK What would I write about? DOCTOR Anything. Whatever you can’t quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place... Write it down. CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge... NICK (to himself) A place... Slowly he takes the pen. We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over. NICK (V.O.) The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance. NICK (V.O.) New York’s dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city... IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here. NICK (V.O.) ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland... NICK (V.O.) ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg... NICK’S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: “Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.” NICK (V.O.) ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God. INT. TRAIN - DAY Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the halted carriage. Nick sits opposite. NICK (V.O.) Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club.... As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet. NICK (V.O.) But the day took an unexpected turn... Tom drags Nick from the moving train. TOM Come on--! EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom. NICK (O.S.) What are we doing? TOM Trust me! NICK Wait a second would you!? TOM (calls back) Dominate Nick! Dominate! PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage. A sign reads: “GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.” INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office. TOM Hello Wilson! How's business? WILSON (unconvincing) I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? TOM I've got my man working on it. WILSON Works pretty slow, don't he? TOM (coldly) Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else? WILSON I don't mean that, I just... Wilson’s grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual. MYRTLE If its business you’re talking, you should be talking to me... (to her husband) Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down... Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom. MYRTLE (CONT’D) (without turning) Hurry up! WILSON Oh, sure... Sure... Wilson hurries out back. TOM Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway. MYRTLE A pleasure... TOM Nick’s a writer... Myrtle is completely uninterested. NICK (feeble) I’m in bonds, actually... TOM (intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train. MYRTLE (playing hard to get) Now...? Are we gettin’ that dog? TOM Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She’ll like him... NICK Oh no, that’s alright, I’m busy... MYRTLE Catherine’s said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know. NICK Really I can’t... TOM (whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That’s rude. CUT TO: INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - DAY The muffled sounds of sex... CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand. CATHERINE I’m Catherine; ain’t we havin’ a party? NICK Oh, I’m... I’m not sure now’s a good time-- I was just going-- But Nick’s exit is blocked. MRS. MCKEE Hello...! MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. MR. MCKEE (extending his hand) Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you. NICK Nick Carraway. MRS. MCKEE Where’re the kids? Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... CATHERINE What’s the matter? Don’t ya like me? SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress. MRS. MCKEE Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable! MYRTLE (with impressive hauteur) It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like! Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. TOM Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet. NICK (making for the door) Tom, I really should be going... TOM (grabbing Nick’s arm) Nonsense... NICK Tom; I don’t think-- Daisy’s my-- Tom pulls Nick back toward the party. TOM Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that’s OK, I make no judgment; but we’ve got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball? CATHERINE Yeah. Ain’t we good enough for ya? Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly lands herself in his lap. CATHERINE (CONT’D) Take off yer hat and stay awhile... TOM Hey Nick! McKee’s in the artistic game. MCKEE Photography. TOM Nick’s artistic. NICK No... Really? MCKEE NICK Ah, no, well, I write a little... Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music. CATHERINE Do you live on Long Island, too? NICK I live at West Egg. CATHERINE Really? I was there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him? NICK I live right next door to him... CATHERINE He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. You know, the evil German king... CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle’s skirt suggestively. TOM Hey McKee, take a picture of that! MYRTLE (girlish glee) Oh, don’t! (MORE) MYRTLE (CONT'D) I’m not one of those models...! But you can if you want... Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick’s ear. CATHERINE Neither of them can stand who they're married to. NICK Doesn’t she like Wilson either? MYRTLE (overhears) ...He’s a greasy little scumbag! Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine. CATHERINE No thanks; I feel just as good on nothing at all... With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill... CATHERINE (CONT’D) Nerve pills, I get them from a doctor in Queens. You want one? NICK My nerves are fine thanks... Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down. NICK (V.O.) I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon... DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, nauseatingly violent... As Catherine undresses Nick... NICK (V.O.) That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York. As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet! MYRTLE ...I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave! Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip... MYRTLE (CONT’D) My dear I'm giving you this dress! Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress. MRS. MCKEE Adorable! Adorable! SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom window, observing the infinite life of the city... NICK (V.O.) High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street... INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, now alone, pen in hand, writes furiously. NICK (V.O.) ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering... EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself upstairs looking out from Myrtle’s window. NICK (V.O.) I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life... POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity... INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling! TOM You’ve got no right to speak her name! Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed... MYRTLE Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it whenever I want! Daisy! Dai-- SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle’s nose! CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY Nick’s been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... NICK I have no clue how I got home. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. He realizes he’s been sleeping on the porch in his underwear. NICK (V.O.) But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling... His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... NICK (V.O.) ....that Gatsby was watching me. INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY The Doctor leans forward. DOCTOR (slightly incredulous) Watching you...? NICK Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... DOCTOR And how do you know that? NICK Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick’s doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... NICK(CONT’D) No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby’s... The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: “Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TWILIGHT A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby’s gates. NICK (V.O.) You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited... As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby’s gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... NICK (V.O.) The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby’s... CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby’s magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs. NICK (V.O.) And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby’s door... A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...! INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby’s... NICK (V.O) A caravansary of... IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over... NICK (V.O.) Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby’s beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors... (MORE) NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven! Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... NICK (to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? He brandishes his invitation. NICK (CONT’D) I live just next door... BARTENDER Mr. Gatsby? I’ve never seen him sir. Why, no one has... The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini. NICK (V.O.) Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk. He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party... NICK Wow. As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind... VOICE I thought I might see you here... Startled, Nick turns to find... Jordan Baker. NICK Hello. JORDAN I remembered you lived next door... NICK Its like... an amusement park. JORDAN Shall we? Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps... NICK Did you get an invitation? JORDAN People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s. NICK Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby? A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects... TEDDY He was a German spy during the war. JORDAN Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway. NICK (to Teddy) A German spy...? Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in... NELSON No, no, no, no. He’s the Kaiser’s assassin. And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds... LANGUID GIRL I heard he killed a man once. NELSON Its true! LANUID GIRL You look at him sometimes when he thinks no one’s watching... I’ll bet he killed a man. TEDDY Kills for fun! Free of charge. NELSON Well he’s already richer than God. Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper. NICK You don’t believe he killed a man do you...? JORDAN (wickedly) Let’s go find him, and you can ask him yourself... As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey is announced, Jordan leads Nick off... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively... JORDAN Oh, Mr. Gatsby...! (to Nick) Shall I lead you into his clutches? INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity. OWL EYES You won’t find him...! He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan. OWL EYES (CONT’D) This house and everything in it, are all part of an elaborate disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn’t exist. JORDAN Phooey; I’ve met him! OWL EYES Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I’ve been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now - but no matter where I look, I can’t find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby. JORDAN (blithely dismissive) Well I don’t care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they’re so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy. NICK (slowly to Owl Eyes) But if that’s true; what’s all this for...? OWL EYES That, my dear fellow, is the question... Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his gaze to... Gatsby’s garden, where, as the band hits fever pitch, and twilight becomes night... THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!! EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening’s many fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!! On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks! NICK I didn’t expect all this... JORDAN (coy) What did you expect? NICK I don’t know... JORDAN Disappointed? NICK Not in the slightest... Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss... TEDDY (to Nick) Penny-less pantywaist! Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away... TEDDY (CONT’D) I’m stealing her away Carraway! Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... ORCHESTRA LEADER Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's “A Jazz History of the World”, and accompanying fireworks! Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off-- TEDDY Look around you! Rich girls don’t marry poor boys-- On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... MAN Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? NICK Yes; The Ninth Battalion. CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty. MAN I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport? NICK (very tipsy) The whole thing’s incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now crumpled invitation) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven’t met Mr. Gatsby, no one’s met him; they say he’s third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil! At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick... MAN I’m afraid I’m not a very good host, old sport... I’m Gatsby. CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops. NICK (muttering apologies) Oh.. I’m very sorry-- I... I’ve had so much to drink... The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky! GATSBY (apologetically) I thought you knew, old sport. Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum. NICK (V.O.) His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in. All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby. HERZOG Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire. Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick. GATSBY I’m trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? Nick shakes himself from his reverie. NICK What time? GATSBY Any time that suits you. Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan. GATSBY (CONT’D) Lovely to see you Miss Baker. He kisses her lightly on the hand. GATSBY (CONT’D) (to Nick) If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me. As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement. NICK I expected him to be... JORDAN Old and fat? NICK Well, yes; young men don’t just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island. JORDAN He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... NICK Why not? JORDAN I don’t know... I just don’t believe he went there... Jordan is interrupted by a voice. HERZOG I beg your pardon... She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them. HERZOG (CONT’D) Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone. JORDAN (surprised) Me? HERZOG Yes, madame. As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... Nick, unsettled, watches her go... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... Seeing Nick, she rushes to him... JORDAN Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense... Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan. TEDDY Where have you been!? The car’s waiting! Jordan is dragged out the door... Nick, on tenterhooks follows, as Jordan calls back... JORDAN Simply amazing! It all makes sense. It all makes sense... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles. Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs. NICK What makes sense...? JORDAN Everything... But here I am tantalizing you... The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, a mysterious smile as she leans out the window. JORDAN (CONT’D) And I swore I wouldn’t tell. But... NICK JORDAN Nick. I’m sorry, I swore I wouldn’t tell. The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... A voice startles him. GATSBY Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning. Herzog appears behind Gatsby. HERZOG Philadelphia on the phone, sir. Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile. GATSBY Good night, old sport... NICK Good night. Thank you. Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch. SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly... OWL EYES Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!? The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention. Jordan, leaning out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him. JORDAN Come and see me... We’ll have tea! I’m in the phone-book! Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his yard from Gatsby’s, he stops; a familiar feeling... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he raises his hand in formal farewell. NICK (V.O) We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MORNING Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of orange juice begins to rattle and shake. Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Gatsby’s yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick’s drive and skids to a stop. Nick emerges to his porch. Gatsby leaps out! GATSBY Its pretty isn’t it, old sport...? Haven’t you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We’re having lunch! SLAM CUT TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity. GATSBY Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow? NICK My... opinion? GATSBY Yes, yes, your opinion! Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life! GATSBY (CONT’D) I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You’ve heard the stories...? NICK Well-- GATSBY I’ll tell you God’s truth. God’s truth about myself! (raises right hand) I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it’s a... a family tradition. As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick’s V.O. fades up. NICK (V.O.) The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying... GATSBY After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe! NICK Europe? Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands... GATSBY Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago... PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY Gatsby hasn’t stopped for breath... GATSBY Then came the war, old sport... NICK (V.O.) Just when I thought it couldn’t be any more fantastical... GATSBY It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life... NICK (V.O.) He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army! CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion. GATSBY In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... Something catches Nick’s eye... NICK’S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson’s Garage. GATSBY (CONT’D) ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead. SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing! GATSBY (CONT’D) I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick’s lap. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here! That’s the one from Montenegro. It looks authentic. Turn it. GATSBY (CONT’D) NICK (reads) Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary. GATSBY That’s right. SLAP! A photograph joins the medal. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here’s another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand. NICK (V.O.) What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true? DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... GATSBY (O.S.) But don’t take my word for it. At lunch, I’m going to introduce you to one of New York’s most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I’ve told you, and vouch for my good character... I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway. NICK I’m sure that’s not necessary... Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity. GATSBY Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don’t want you to think I’m just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I’m going to make a very big request of you today. NICK A big request? GATSBY Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. NICK (caught off guard) Jordan...? What’s she got to do with it? GATSBY Oh, I assure you it’s nothing underhand. Miss Baker’s an honest sportswoman; she’d never do anything that wasn’t alright... RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside. COP Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb! GATSBY (calmly) All right, old sport! Alright. Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... COP (embarrassed) Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me! The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge! NICK One of your old Oxford pals? GATSBY Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. (adds proudly) I imagine he’ll be at lunch too... NICK By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. An orchestral melody surges... NICK (V.O.) I didn’t know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... As the orchestra builds, Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... NICK (V.O.) Even Gatsby could happen... BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into: INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune! PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO: INT. DICK DIVER’S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop... In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM. WOLFSHEIM Ah my boy...! They embrace. GATSBY Meyer, Meyer... WOLFSHEIM You smell so good. GATSBY Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim. Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop. WOLFSHEIM A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway. I know all about you. NICK Really? WOLD Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always talking about you. Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out... WOLFSHEIM (sinister) Come, join us for a little lunch... INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy... ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings. WOLFSHEIM (whispers to Gatsby) Tell Walter Chase; “he shuts his mouth or he doesn’t get a penny...” GATSBY We’ll talk about that later... The HEAD WAITER appears. HEAD WAITER Highballs, Mr. Gatsby? GATSBY Yes, highballs it is. (points to Nick) You take good care of my friend here! A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth. COMMISSIONER Hey Jay...! You’re under arrest!!! Gatsby smiles and tips his hat. GATSBY You be careful now. You’re turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner. (to Nick) See, that’s the Commissioner back there. Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low... He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table. GATSBY (CONT’D) You be careful at those tables now Senator! SENATOR GULICK Of course! I’ll put a bet on for you Jay! Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on the stage. Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile. GATSBY Shall we order? (to the waiter) Lobster tails all round. (to Nick) They decorate it with truffle slices and fine herbs. Very artistic. Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick... WOLFSHEIM So... How is the bond business Mr. Carraway? NICK It’s fine, thank you. WOLFSHEIM I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion-- GATSBY No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about. WOLFSHEIM Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man. Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up. GATSBY Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. (gesturing to Nick) Meyer, do you mind? Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone. WOLFSHEIM Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby’s acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such... medals. And, an Oggsford man. Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford? NICK I've heard of it... WOLFSHEIM Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife... NICK I’m not... married. WOLFSHEIM But you work on Wall Street, right? NICK (totally confused) Yes... Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit. WOLFSHEIM Looking at my tiepin? CLOSE ON: The pin. WOLFSHEIM (CONT’D) Finest specimen of human molars... Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns. GATSBY Gentlemen. Everything alright...? NICK Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people’s wives... GATSBY (taking his seat) Other people’s wives? Ah... I see. Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim. GATSBY (CONT’D) Other people’s wives... Meyer? Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... WOLFSHEIM Well, my work here is done. I’ll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women... Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... GATSBY You’ll have to excuse him... In his old age, he’s prone to “digress...” He’s a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... NICK Who is he anyhow? GATSBY Meyer? He’s a gambler. Over Nick and Gatsby’s shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... NICK An actor? GATSBY Meyer? No. He’s the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. NICK Fixed it? Fixed it. GATSBY NICK How did he manage that? GATSBY He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He’s a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table. TOM Hey Nick! Nick! Where’ve you been!? Daisy’s furious you haven’t called up. Nick and Gatsby stand. NICK This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. GATSBY I’m so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. Tom turns back to Nick. TOM I wouldn’t have expected to find you in this temple of virtue. NICK I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... CUT TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts. DISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... NICK I’m looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I’ve spotted her. Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan. NICK (CONT’D) What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? An immaculate MAITRE’D offers Nick a chair. MAITRE’D Will the gentleman be joining? NICK (frustrated) One moment please-- JORDAN Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant. As Nick’s frustration and Jordan’s embarrassment grow-- NICK It’s all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he’s going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is-- JORDAN If you’ll just have a seat-- NICK What is this big request!? JORDAN Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea. NICK Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? Nick sits... Why? NICK (CONT’D) JORDAN Well... I don’t know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY TIGHT ON: Golf shoes biting into soft, green grass. JORDAN (O.S.) It was the day I got my new English golf shoes. WIDE: A row of fancy Louisville homes - red, white and blue bunting “tut, tutting” in the breeze - are set along a beautiful, green stretch of park. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) Daisy was by far the most popular girl with the Officers from Camp Taylor... Across the road, 18 YEAR OLD DAISY is perched in the front seat of her flashy white roadster, beaming, happy... JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) One of them was in the car with her. Beside Daisy REVEAL: A handsome lieutenant: YOUNG JAY GATSBY. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) It was Gatsby. And the way he looked at her... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK The silhouettes of Jordan and Nick, leaned close, are lit magnificently against the beaded lights of the city... JORDAN (O.S.) Is the way all girls want to be looked at. Their eyes meet; a conspiring flicker. NICK (blown away) So what happened? JORDAN Well, I don’t know... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FRENCH BATTLEFIELD - DAY Gatsby leads his men on a heroic charge out of the trenches-- JORDAN (O.S.) Gatsby was sent off to war... A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the battlefield! JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) But when the war ended... For some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn’t return... DISSOLVE TO: MONTAGE. A NEWSPAPER FILLS THE SCREEN: “AMERICA’S WEALTHIEST BACHELOR TO WED: TOM BUCHANAN LURES LOUISVILLE’S SWEETHEART.” JORDAN (O.S.) A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago swept in and stole her away... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - NIGHT An exquisite string of pearls coils around Daisy’s neck. JORDAN (O.S.) He gave her a string of pearls worth 350,000. REVEAL: Tom, tightening the clasp. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL. DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - MORNING JORDAN (O.S.) But, the morning of the wedding, Daisy received a letter... On the bed, Daisy, hysterical, clutches a bottle in one hand and a letter in the other. DAISY (screams) Tell them Daisy’s changed her mind! JORDAN Daisy! Please, everyone’s waiting! Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck... YOUNG DAISY Give them back!! Suddenly! Daisy tears the pearls and hurls them; they explode into a hundred shimmering pieces against the hard wood floor! CUT TO: A set of stern, white heels clicking down the hall... REVEAL: Daisy’s hard-mouthed MOTHER. DAISY’S MOTHER What on earth is going on in here!? her mother’s eyes land on the bottle, and then the letter... PUSH IN: The last line of the letter reads: Love, Jay. DAISY Leave me alone! DAISY’S MOTHER Jordan, run the bath! Now! DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - BATHROOM - MORNING In the bath, Daisy’s grips the letter in her trembling hands. NICK (O.S.) What was in the letter? A deep breath, a last look, and then, Daisy opens her hand... The letter comes to pieces like snow. JORDAN (O.S.) I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me. But before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: “The truth is...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos. JORDAN (O.S.) Anyways, that day, at five o’clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs. JORDAN After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... (MORE) JORDAN (CONT'D) I’d never seen a girl so in love with her husband. (muses cynically) A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he’s struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought. NICK It’s a strange coincidence, isn’t it? Gatsby’s house being just across the bay... Jordan whirls round-- JORDAN It’s no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she’d wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her. Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time. NICK All that for a girl he hasn’t seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? (to himself) The modesty of it. JORDAN Kind of takes your breath away, doesn’t it? A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS Jordan slides in... TAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to? JORDAN Long Island, please. NICK And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby? JORDAN (a stern whisper) She’s absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can “happen to drop by.” CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... NICK (V.O.) I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew? As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick’s taxi pulls past Gatsby’s mansion, ablaze with light. NICK (V.O.) When I returned home, Gatsby’s was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn’t a sound. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT As Nick’s taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick. NICK Your place looks like the World’s Fair... or Coney Island! GATSBY (terribly anxious) Ah, does it? I’ve... I’ve just been glancing into some rooms... Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-- NICK It’s too late tonight. GATSBY Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer... NICK I must go to bed... Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea. GATSBY Oh, that’s alright. I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK What day would suit you? GATSBY What day would suit you...? I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK Day after tomorrow alright? GATSBY Day after tomorrow? Well, I’d... I’d want to get the grass cut. They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick’s ragged lawn ends and Gatsby’s manicured one begins. GATSBY (CONT’D) There’s another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you? NICK Not really. GATSBY If you’ll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I’m saying right? You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport? NICK Trying to. GATSBY Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. NICK I've got my hands full. Gatsby’s face falls. GATSBY You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you. NICK No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor. Nick’s sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. GATSBY A favor? Yes. NICK As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life... GATSBY Ah, right, right... Goodnight. NICK Goodnight. With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing castle. Nick’s gaze falls upon the unkempt lawn. He smiles. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - DAY TOP SHOT: An enormous mower clatters through frame, carving Nick’s unkempt lawn into a fresh, broad, band of green. REVEAL: An army of gardnders giving Nick’s lawn and garden a make-over, fresh paint, new flowers, trimmed hedges... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY Heavy rain now falls. Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases... Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside. On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly. GATSBY One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal... An awkward beat. NICK The grass looks fine. GATSBY Grass? Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing. GATSBY (CONT’D) What Grass? SUDDEN CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence. WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. The silence stretches, and stretches... Finally... GATSBY Have you got everything you need? NICK Perhaps more flowers? GATSBY I think they did a fine job, don’t you? Beautiful. NICK GATSBY You think it’s too much? NICK I think it’s what you want. GATSBY I think so too... She’ll be impressed, won’t she old sport? NICK I am. With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet! GATSBY I can’t wait all day. I’m leaving! NICK Don’t be silly. It’s just two minutes to four... But Gatsby heads for the door... GATSBY Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late! BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy’s Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic. NICK It’s her. PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Daisy’s chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive. As Nick assists Daisy from the car... DAISY Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? She looks at him with a mysterious smile. DAISY (CONT’D) Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me? NICK That’s the secret of Carraway Castle. (playing along) Tell your chauffeur to go far away. DAISY Come back in an hour, Ferdie! (grave murmur) His name is Ferdie. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY Daisy continues ahead into the living room. Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy’s reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... DAISY (O.S.) Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can’t believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse? INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAISY (to herself) He is in love with me... Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy’s merely been admiring the flower display... NICK That’s funny. DAISY What’s funny? KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door. NICK One moment... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS Nick opens the door. Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick. NICK What are you doing? Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy’s, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur. DAISY I’m certainly glad to see you again. Gatsby’s face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. Finally, he finds words... GATSBY I’m... certainly glad to see you as well. Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the tension-- CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur. GATSBY We've met before... SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby’s elbow... And falls! And breaks! GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah... sorry... He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again! NICK (idiotically) It's an old... clock. DAISY (desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. Gatsby takes a seat. A long silent beat. DAISY (CONT’D) We haven't met for many years. GATSBY (an automatic reflex) Five years next November. The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. NICK (abruptly) Tea? GATSBY (dying) Thank you old sport. DAISY (also mortified) Darling thank you. Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. A long, terrible silence... Suddenly Nick stands. NICK I just need to... pop into town. GATSBY (horrified) Town...? NICK The village; I'll be right back. As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows. GATSBY I've got to speak to you...! INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Wildly following Nick, Gatsby whispers miserably: GATSBY Oh, God! This is a mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake... NICK You're just embarrassed, that's all... Daisy's embarrassed too. GATSBY She's embarrassed? NICK Just as much as you are. GATSBY Don't talk so loud! NICK You're acting like a little boy! You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and... Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain. NICK (V.O.) Looking over my story so far, I’m reminded that for the second time that summer... WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone. NICK (V.O.) I was guarding other people’s secrets. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked. NICK (V.O.) Once again I was within... He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy’s attention, to no avail... The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other. NICK (V.O.) And without... Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing. He clears his throat: NICK Its... stopped raining. Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows. GATSBY Yes, it has... (to Daisy) Hasn’t it? He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) What do you think of that, Daisy? Come look. Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - CONTINUOUS DAISY Look. Its my house. Just there across the bay... Gatsby and Daisy’s eyes meet. GATSBY I know. I have the same view from my place. DAISY Where’s your place? Gatsby turns back to Nick. GATSBY Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I’d like to show her around. NICK Are you sure you want me to come? GATSBY Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - DAY Servants swing open ivy-covered gates... GATSBY (proudly) I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy. REVEAL: Gatsby’s castle glistening in the sunlight. CLOSE ON: Daisy. A delighted cry. DAISY Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand! GATSBY Do you like it? DAISY I love it...! But how do you live here all alone? GATSBY I don’t. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people... As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick. GATSBY (CONT’D) My house looks well doesn’t it? See how the whole front catches the light like that? Daisy yells back... DAUSY Come on you two! I want the royal tour! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDENS - DAY Gatsby has transformed into a good-natured show-off, hurrying Nick and Daisy through a maze of fantastical gardens, past magnificent fountains and into his castle... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY Gatbsy shows off his brand new orange-juicer. GATBSY You must understand, I like all things that are modern. Daisy readies a cocktail shaker beneath the spout of the giant silver orange juice machine. GATSBY If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there... The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour...! Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S BEACH - DIVING PONTOON - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy, Nick and Gatsby drunkenly drive golf balls out toward the bay. Nick films on the world’s first home-camcorder... GATSBY Its a remarkable little camera-- latest design. While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne... DAISY You do know, I’m a champion golfer, don’t you? Here, I’ll show you how its done. CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two! She falls into Gatsby arms... Nick films... GATSBY She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don’t you think...? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING Gatsby and Nick trail behind Daisy, crossing the ballroom. Daisy, champagne in hand, spots the soaring ballroom organ. DAISY Oh...! Its beautiful. GATSBY Its a custom Wurlitzer. DAISY Can anyone play it? GATSBY Klipspringer can. (to his footmen) Someone wake Ewing! Daisy twirls round, overjoyed... DAISY Music! And we can dance all night! GATSBY Ewing’s a symphonic genius, he can play anything...! Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down... DAISY Then I demand a Charleston! Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick... GATSBY (as if in a dream) She makes it look so splendid, don’t you think old sport? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE. GATSBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING Nick and Daisy follow Gatsby into the bedroom... Gatsby bounds ahead, starting up a spiral stair... He throws open a massive cabinet, revealing a prism of suits, dressing- gowns, watches and ties. GATSBY I've got a man in England who buys me clothes...! He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat... GATSBY (CONT’D) Something for the lady... Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the rail to Daisy... DAISY I’ve never seen anything like it! GATSBY He sends over a selection at the beginning of each season... DAISY Jay! With ever-increasing enthusiasm! GATSBY These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton! Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched... DAISY No, Jay... you’ll ruin them! (to Nick) Nicky! He’s a madman! More and more and more shirts float down... The rumble of distant thunder. CLOSE ON: Daisy. TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter, like giant snowflakes, down toward her. Slowly, quietly, her mirth transforms to sobs... She hides her face in shirts... Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy, taking her tear-streaked face in his hands... GATSBY What is it? DAISY It’s just... It makes me sad, because... Daisy glances in Nick’s direction... GATSBY Why? DAISY ...because... A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart. NICK (V.O.) Five lost years struggled on Daisy’s lips. But all she could manage was... DAISY It’s just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before. GATSBY If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light... DAISY What green light? GATSBY The one that burns all night at the end of your dock. As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay... NICK (V.O.) Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume... NICK Who's this? Your father? GATSBY No, no.. That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby... DAISY (teases) You never told me you had a pompadour... or a yacht. Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk... GATSBY I want to show you something... Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you. They admire a scrapbook together. DAISY (touched) You saved my letters... GATSBY This was my first photo of you. As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER: DAISY (V.O.) We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing. Come home, I’ll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true... Come home Jay... BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills. GATSBY Excuse me. Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away... He lowers his voice. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) Well I can't talk now old sport... As the timbre of Gatsby’s voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) I said a small town. ECU: Gatsby’s eyes narrow. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) He must know what a small town is. BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows! As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby... GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) (frightening) Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town... Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick’s eye - a tense moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile. We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ... GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! Shall we? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston with Nick. An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, looking on, flush with joy. Slowly though, Gatsby’s expression turns introspective. As he watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him... DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK. AN ARRAY OF MEMORIES AND IMAGES DISSOLVE ONE INTO THE OTHER: Gatsby and Daisy, five years ago, about to kiss; a hand- written letter; a gathering storm; the green light... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT Hundreds of candles flicker in patterns. As a slow, melancholic waltz plays, Gatsby and Daisy dance, enraptured... DAISY (whispers) I wish I had done everything on earth with you. All my life. Gatsby holds her closer. DAISY (CONT’D) I wish that it could always be like this... GATSBY It will be... Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own... NICK (V.O.) If only it had been enough for Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy... The towering doors close. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Gatsby stands at his window, staring into the night. NICK (V.O.) But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy’s part in it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick is writing at his desk... NICK (V.O.) It wasn’t until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy... INT.

NORTH DAKOTA FARM HUT - DAY PUSH TOWARD: A dilapidated hut, shrouded in a storm of dust. NICK (V.O.) His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota... DISCOVER: YOUNG GATZ, barefoot, at a dusty desk, surrounded by tattered books, strange charts, and lists. He is practicing his signature... NICK (V.O.) But he never accepted them as his parents at all. Young Gatz turns from his writing, and looks through a hole in the roof towards the infinite heavens... NICK (V.O.) In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God... CLOSE ON: The little boy looks up at CAMERA. NICK (V.O.) Destined for future glory... DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAKE SUPERIOR - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON: A handsome 17 year old YOUNG GATSBY, in a torn jersey and dirty canvas pants, rowing with all his might. NICK (V.O.) One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril... Young Gatsby lets the row boat drift close to a magnificent yacht. Wind is whipping whitecaps on the bay. NICK He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... The bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht’s railing. CODY Whadzamatta...? Cody is very drunk. Young Gatsby calls urgently. YOUNG GATSBY Sir! The shoal here’s real bad, this wind could drag you onto it... Cody waves a dismissive arm... CODY Whaderathinkyerdoin..., old sport? He collapses, dead drunk. PUSH IN: On Young Gatsby; a plan forming... NICK (V.O.) This was his opportunity, and he seized it. Springing into action, he clambers onto the yacht. GATSBY (VOICE) I decided right then and there to call myself: Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - LATE AFTERNOON Young Gatsby hoists the sail as the storm rages around him. NICK (V.O.) He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY A perfect sunny day. Young Gatsby and Cody are sailing. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world... GATSBY (VOICE) He was alright, old Dan, he taught me everything... DISSOLVE TO: INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY Young Gatsby, now transformed, models a suit in the mirror. NICK (V.O.) How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman... He looks squarely at himself, and repeats a mantra. YOUNG GATSBY Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY Young Gatsby stands at the bow, as the yacht cut across the clear blue ocean... He turns to Cody and calls... YOUNG GATSBY She looks well, doesn’t she...!? Old sport. HIGH AND WIDE: The yacht sails toward the golden sun... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody’s fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody’s family... He’d been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor. NEWSPAPER MONTAGE. SLAM CUT TO: Piles and piles of New York City newspapers swirl rapidly TOWARD CAMERA, and we read their headlines: “GATBSY’S STAGGERING WEALTH - MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!” NICK (V.O.) By midsummer Gatsby was front page news... “GATSBY BUYING OUR CITY? INVESTMENT MONOPOLY FUELS CONCERNS” “JAY CASHES IN! GATSBY STRIKES WALL STREET GOLD!” “GATSBY INVESTS IN SKYSCRAPERS!” “JAY PAYS FOR EVERYTHING: PARTIES, GALAS, PARKS, SCHOOLS!” “WALL STREETS KING? MEET JAY GATSBY!” A final newspaper COVERS FRAME: “WHERE’S THE MONEY FROM!? MYSTERY MILLIONS SPARK WILD RUMORS” We PUSH TOWARD the paper and DISSOLVE TOWARD: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT Another glittering party. NICK (V.O.) Where did the money comes from? FADE IN: Decadent, grotesque images of drunken revellers... NICK (V.O.) That’s what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom’s mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby’s glittering parties... DISCOVER: Gatsby leading Tom, Daisy and Nick to the top of the terrace stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT GATSBY We’ve got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me... He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick... TOM (mutters to Daisy) A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers. DAISY Not Gatsby. He’s a businessman. TOM (snorts) Hah! A businessman... DAISY He owned a lot of drug stores. Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group... GATSBY May I introduce Senator Gulick? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan... DAISY Delighted... GATSBY And Mr. Buchanan... (a moment's hesitation) The polo player. TOM (objecting quickly) Oh no. Not me. SENATOR GULICK (shaking hands, nods) Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan. Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy: TOM I’d rather not be the polo player. DAISY Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements. Gatsby interjects-- GATSBY (to the group) May I show you around? He guides them down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) You must see the faces of a lot of people you’ve heard of. DAISY Absolutely! TOM (scoffs) We don’t go around very much. I don’t think I recognize a single person... GATSBY Perhaps you know that lady there? Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star. DAISY (taking Gatsby’s arm) Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures... As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick... TOM I’d really rather not be the polo player... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT Tom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... DAISY (to Nick) These things excite me so... Gatsby turns to Tom... GATSBY I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. TOM That’s right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop... GATSBY That’s right. See... I know your wife. TOM Is that so? GATSBY Yes. As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity. HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here... Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... GATSBY Not now. Herzog silently recedes... A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... TRIMALCHIO And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot! Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... GATSBY Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye. TOM Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. As Daisy takes Gatsby’s arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom’s breast pocket and murmurs... DAISY In case you need to take down any addresses... As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT As Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly. DAISY Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? GATSBY No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... DAISY It’s perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT Tom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought. TOM I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... TOM (CONT’D) (to Nick) I’ll find you... He leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... Gatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy. Then, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... Gatsby turns, and Daisy’s lips suddenly find his. A long, still kiss... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Nick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree. When Tom suddenly appears... TOM Have you seen my wife...? Startled, Nick turns... NICK (lies) Ah... no... Not for awhile. TOM That’s funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. Tom follows Nick’s gaze down toward the tree... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby and Daisy continue their passionate kissing... After a moment, Daisy whispers. DAISY I... I wish we could just run away. Gatbsy is startled. GATSBY Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn’t be... respectable. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Tom is still looking to the tree. TOM (quizzically) You live near here Nick...? Nick, an overwhelming sense of guilt, indicates vaguely in the direction of the tree. NICK Just next door. TOM That so...? EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby continues... GATSBY We’re going to live here, in this house, together. You and me... Daisy... It’s time for you to tell Tom. EXT. GATBSY CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Nick, a moment of extreme tension as he fears Tom will investigate further. SUDDENLY! Their attention is drawn to a commotion on the terrace. Glasses smash, a woman screams, and through the crowd, we see Slagle and associates causing a disturbance. TOM (pure disdain) What a circus... Well, if you see her, I’ll be looking for her. You tell her. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT The hidden lovers speak in intense, hushed tones. DAISY Remember how much fun we used to have? Why can’t we just have fun like that again? Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows... Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled... DAISY (CONT’D) Oh hello Nicky; we’re having a row. NICK What about? Daisy glides toward him... DAISY About things... About the future... (trying to be funny) The future of the Colored Empires. NICK Well, its Tom. He’s wandering around the party looking for you. Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs... HERZOG Sir; it’s Mr. Slagle; he’s quite... emotional. A tiny, ruffled, moment; then Gatsby elegantly guides Daisy toward Nick. GATSBY Excuse me. Nick, would you mind? As Gatsby follows Herzog back toward the castle.... CLOSE ON: DAISY. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER Nick and Daisy return to a party that has become grotesque; drunken girls haphazardly bang drums... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby disappeared to deal with a dispute of some sort. Daisy waited... CLOSE ON: Daisy, dejected... NICK But Gatsby was unable to return. As Daisy and Nick cross the tattered, streamer-littered dance- floor CRANE HIGH AND FADE INTO: the library window... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby sits, solemn in an armchair; with quiet unease written in shadows across his face. REVEAL: The ominous silhouette of Wolfsheim, pacing between Gatsby and the window; Herzog standing watch... We catch only a fragment of the conversation. WOLFSHEIM When these hot headed types appear, I rely on you... But you were not available.. A scene was made... What’s going on with you Jay? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATE - NIGHT HIGH SHOT: A sleek black limo winds quietly towards the gate. CRANE DOWN TO DISCOVER: Daisy’s face through the limo window; her forlorn eyes search for Gatsby behind castle walls... TOM Where were you? DAISY With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds. TOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... DAISY’S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. TOM (O.C.) (CONT’D) I’d like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I’ll make a point of finding out. As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby’s “guards.” CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby’s gate, GATSBY’S COAT OF ARMS READS: “Ad Finem Fidelis” (”Faithful to the End”). DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... Nick descends the stairs, drunk. NICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... Gatsby is not amused. GATSBY She didn’t like it. NICK Of course she did. GATSBY No, she didn’t like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It’s hard to make her understand. NICK You mean about the party? GATSBY The party!? I couldn’t care less about the parties! You see... (shocking intensity) (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. What...? NICK GATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents’ house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we’ll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. NICK I wouldn’t ask too much of her... GATSBY Ask too much? NICK No. Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. GATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- NICK Jay... You can’t repeat the past. Gatsby wheels around... GATSBY Can’t repeat the past? NICK No. GATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You’ll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything’s been so... so confused since then... Gatsby looks out to the green light. NICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... GATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. NICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... IN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY’S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... DISSOLVE TO: I/E. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT PUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping... NICK (V.O.) Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy’s house by colossal accident. Amidst the many revellers, DISCOVER: Daisy, hurrying through the crowd. GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I’d never been in such a beautiful house before... Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer’s uniform. NICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. Daisy’s Mother stops her on the steps. DAISY MOM Daisy, don’t scamper. (whispers) There’s so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family’s... CLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. Against his better judgement he follows Daisy up... INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT Checking to make sure no one has seen, Daisy slips quietly through a set of doors, into the conservatory... Gatsby is not far behind... A secret rendezvous. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT GATSBY I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her... INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT Daisy throws herself in to Gatsby’s arms... About to kiss, Gatsby is struck by a sudden instinctive thought... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT Gatsby remembers... GATSBY So I stopped. And I waited... I waited... INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT Gatsby’s eyes drift up... GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I waited for a moment longer. He looks out the dark, crystal windows, beyond the trees... to a staircase of moonlight, climbing up, up, up... NICK (V.O.) He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like... the mind of God... That falling in love would change his destiny... forever. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT GATSBY And then I just let myself go. INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT With sudden resolve Gatsby kisses Daisy... In ravenous embrace, they fall onto the long sofa lounge. NICK (V.O.) She blossomed for him like a flower... ECU: Daisy, her lips tremble, eyes wide, breath quickening.. NICK (V.O.) And the incarnation was complete. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT The other layers of IMAGERY IN THE CLOUDS MELT AWAY, leaving Nick and Gatsby standing by the pool. GATSBY I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I’m only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars. GATSBY (CONT’D) It’s got to keep going up. Gatsby looks to the green light. GATSBY (CONT’D) She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them. GATSBY (CONT’D) Don’t worry old sport, don’t worry. I can protect her here. Good night old sport... Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls... GATSBY (CONT’D) You’re wrong about the past, old sport...! Gatsby’s POV: The green light across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) You’re wrong. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EARLY SPRING - MORNING The first day of spring; out the window, birds chirp. Nick is writing and reading aloud... NICK (READS) There had been music from my neighbor’s all summer. In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars... He struggles for a more poetic phrasing... NICK (CONT’D) Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars... (MORE) NICK (CONT’D) (that’s the one) But after Tom and Daisy visit... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby’s castle cuts a grave silhouette against a stormy sky. NICK (V.O.) There were no more parties... His lights flicker and go out. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby’s lights went out one by one. At the gates flashbulbs flash! Hordes of press have gathered. NICK (V.O.) Daisy visited discreetly. But... As the gates creak open, Daisy’s limo slides up the drive... FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “PARTY PALACE GOES DARK!” NICK (V.O.) The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat. As the reporters crowd the limo, shouting questions... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEFROOM - NIGHT Locked away deep in the castle, Gatsby and Daisy make love. FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “WHO IS THE MYSTERY WOMAN?” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - DUSK At the end of the wharf, Gatsby and Daisy look out across the bay, watching as the sun slides into the horizon, and the green light pulses... CLOSE ON: Daisy.

GATSBY’S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby... GATSBY (O.S.) I’ve been meaning to call you up. I’m sorry, I’ve been... so busy. NICK (O.S.) Is everything alright? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone... GATSBY Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. NICK (O.S.) I hear you fired all your servants? GATSBY Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn’t gossip... until we decided what we’re going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? (clarifies) They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes... GATSBY (CONT’D) What’s the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON Nick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby whispers into the phone... GATSBY (excited) Nick... Daisy’s ready. Shes ready. But there’s just one thing. She’s requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? (an admission) Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON PUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY WIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun... DISSOLVE TO: INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter. TOM You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates... TOM (CONT’D) Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... TOM (CONT’D) The sun is getting colder every year... Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. The tension is excruciating. Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay. TOM (CONT’D) How I’d like to be out on that bay today. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle. GATSBY I’m right across from you. (points) Right there. TOM (unimpressed) So you are. Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy. GATSBY Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. TOM What light? Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy’s... GATSBY You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-- With sudden intensity Daisy stands! DAISY (on the verge of tears) It's so hot... Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard. DAISY (CONT’D) Everything's so confused. She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter. DAISY (CONT’D) What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that... (she snaps it again) ...and for the next thirty years? (turns suddenly) Let’s all go to town! Who wants to go to town? Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock. TOM Town!? Women... They get these notions... Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy’s trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet... GATSBY (whispers) Daisy... DAISY (as if they are alone) You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square... CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening. DAISY (CONT’D) The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts. CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar. NICK (V.O.) She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen... SUDDENLY Tom explodes! TOM Let’s go to town! I’m perfectly willing...! That’s a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately! DAISY Just like that? Can’t anyone at least have a cigarette? TOM We’ve smoked all through lunch. DAISY Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss. TOM It was your great idea Daisy. Why don’t we!? We’ll all go to town! Daisy doesn’t budge. DAISY I’ve changed my mind... (teases) You brute. TOM (a dangerous intensity) You’ve got me all excited, and now you don’t want to go? We’ll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey... It will be fun. DAISY Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... Come on, Jordan. As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby. TOM Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby? Then turns and calls to Henri... TOM (CONT’D) Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel. CUT TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women. BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel. Daisy and Jordan follow. TOM Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I’ll drive everyone else in your circus wagon. GATSBY I don’t think there’s much gas, old sport. Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare. TOM (looks at the gauge) Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we’ll stop at a drug store. I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays... (savagely eyes Gatsby) Isn’t that right, Mr. Gatsby? A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom’s arm. DAISY You take Nick and Jordan, Tom! She slips quickly into the coupé... DAISY (CONT’D) We’ll meet you at the Plaza! I’ll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes... Gatsby’s and Tom’s eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance. Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust. I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick... TOM You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow. JORDAN (condescending) And you found he was an Oxford man? TOM Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake! With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: The Duesenberg tears into the Valley... JORDAN (O.C.) (mocking) We’re almost out of gas Tom... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson’s... Wilson doesn’t budge. He’s staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg. TOM Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let’s have some gas... (gets out) Do I have to do it myself? WILSON I’m sick. I’m all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West. TOM Your wife does...? Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle’s face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... NICK (V.O.) Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control... WILSON I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin’ whether she wants to or not. Tom isn’t listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust! TOM What do I owe you!? WILSON Dollar twenty. The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg. TOM You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/TOM’S COUPÉ - DAY VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... SLAM CUT TO: INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... TOM That’s enough... The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration. DAISY Open another window. NICK There aren't any more. DAISY Then telephone for an axe... TOM Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it. GATSBY Why not let her alone, old sport? TOM That's a great expression of yours, isn't it? GATSBY What is? Tom turns to Gatsby... TOM 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up? DAISY Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly. TOM Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man. GATSBY No, not exactly. TOM Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford. GATSBY Yes - I went there. Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting. TOM Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford! Tom...! Gatsby stands. DAISY GATSBY (slow, intense) I told you I went there. TOM I heard you, but I'd like to know when. GATSBY You’d like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby. GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. Nick can’t help but smile. NICK (V.O.) I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back. DAISY I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... But Tom’s not done yet. TOM Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question. GATSBY Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on. TOM What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow? They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content. DAISY He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control! TOM Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we’ll have intermarriage between black and white! JORDAN We’re all white here, Tom. GATSBY Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me! TOM You must be crazy. GATSBY No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me! JORDAN We should go... GATSBY Daisy and I have nothing to hide... DAISY Jay let’s go, please...! TOM Sit down Daisy! GATSBY (reassuring) Yes, Daisy, please sit down. Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note. TOM What's been going on? I want to hear all about it. GATSBY I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...! Tom turns to Daisy sharply. TOM You've been seeing him for five years? GATSBY Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know... TOM Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. Tom starts to make himself a drink... GATSBY No... TOM She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time... DAISY You’re revolting... Daisy’s voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn... DAISY (CONT’D) Do you know why we left Chicago...? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree. Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy. GATSBY That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever. Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly. DAISY Why, how could I love him, possibly? GATSBY You never loved him. Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing. DAISY I never loved him. GATSBY That’s right... TOM Not at Kapiolani? DAISY No. TOM (a husky tenderness) Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never? DAISY Please don’t. TOM Daisy... Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone. DAISY There, Jay. She trembles as she looks to Gatsby... DAISY (CONT’D) You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past. (begins to sob) I did love him once; but I loved you too. GATSBY (shocked, uncomprehending) You loved me too? TOM (savage) Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget. The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby. GATSBY I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now... DAISY Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true. TOM Of course it wouldn't. Daisy turns to her husband. DAISY As if it mattered to you. TOM Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on. GATSBY You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. TOM Nonsense. DAISY (with visible effort) I am, though. TOM She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby. TOM (CONT’D) Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim’s bunch. Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly. TOM (CONT’D) See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter! GATSBY What about it, old sport? TOM Don’t call me ‘old sport!’ This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now. GATSBY Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t too proud to come in on it. TOM I’ve been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim? GATSBY It’s called ‘greed,’ old sport. TOM That’s right; you’ve got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... (to Nick) I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to drag you in... Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. TOM (CONT’D) My God, he has... GATSBY He’s got nothing to do with-- TOM With your little racket... (to Daisy) Daisy... Can’t you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he’s just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...! GATSBY (a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that’s it, and now I’ve just as much as you; so that means we’re equal!! Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn. TOM Oh no, no, we’re different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and Jordan) They are... (now at Daisy) She is; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) we’re all different from you - we were born different, it’s in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage. GATSBY SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... NICK (V.O) Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had “killed a man.” Tom snorts a dismissive laugh. TOM That’s right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears. DAISY My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists. GATSBY Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don’t listen to him Daisy. Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently. GATSBY (CONT’D) We’re going back to Louisville to be married. Then we’re going to live together in our house; it’s-- There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... DAISY Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom. TOM You two start on home... (to Gatsby) In Mr. Gatsby's car. Daisy is alarmed now. TOM (CONT’D) Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her. GATSBY Daisy...! Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel. TOM Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick? What? Want any? NICK TOM NICK No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I’m thirty. Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink... TOM Happy birthday... Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... NICK (V.O.) Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness... NICK’S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge... NICK (V.O.) The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death... DISSOLVE TO: INT. WILSON’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT MYRTLE FLIES PAST CAMERA as Wilson drags her across the room! WILSON God knows everything you've been doing! Grabbing his wife’s hair he presses her face to the window. WILSON (CONT’D) You might fool me but you can't fool God! OVER WILSON’S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. WILSON (CONT’D) God sees everything! Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing. The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby’s yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing. CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper. MYRTLE (thinking its Tom) He’s here... WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson’s face as she twists from his grasp! CUT TO: EXT. WILSON’S GARAGE - TWILIGHT Standing outside his restaurant, the owner, MICHAELIS sees Myrtle rush out of the garage shouting hysterically. MYRTLE Stop, Tom, please, stop! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS SUDDENLY! Myrtle appears in the headlights of Gatsby’s car... ECU: The sleeve of the pink suit and the 'Daisy' signet ring, as Gatsby’s hand on the wheel tries to veer away...! GATSBY No...! BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle! SLOW MOTION, TERRIBLE, NIGHTMARISH, EXPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES: Glass shattering, blood splattering, Daisy screaming, Myrtle’s body flying through the air, her pearls showering the night like a thousand new stars... THUMP. Her torn open body hits the ground. CLOSE ON: The giant billboard, the towering eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleberg, watching everything... DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WHITES OF THE EYES TO: INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: The coupe’s blinding headlights. As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion. TOM Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let’s take a look.. JORDAN Must we? TOM Just a look. INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - NIGHT The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe. Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying and wailing a high, horrible call. WILSON O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones. CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... MYRTLE’S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom’s reaction. A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names. POLICEMAN (to Tom) Sir. Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to step away-- TOM Get off me...! (regains his composure) I’m fine. I’m fine. POLICEMAN You knew her? TOM (a long pause) No... Not really... POLICEMAN Well then I have to ask you to step back. TOM What happened...? POLICEMAN She ran out ‘inna road. Son-of-a- bitch didn't even stopus car. A well-dressed African American man steps near. WELL-DRESSED MAN I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car. CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up. MICHAELIS Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job. Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... WILSON You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson. TOM (a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into: INT. WILSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. TOM Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom. POLICEMAN What color's your car? TOM Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York. MICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped... The policeman accepts, suspicious still... POLICEMAN Alright... Blue. In the relative calm of the office, Wilson’s clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom. WILSON Who owns the yella’ car...? TOM (a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he’s a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... WILSON Maybe he was the one foolin’ with Myrtle; maybe that’s why he killed her...? TOM Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... Wilson starts sobbing again. WILSON Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! He rests his head on Tom’s shoulder... Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers... TOM Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He’ll pay... Oh, he’ll pay... DISSOLVE TO: INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Tom driving. He sobs... TOM The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing... TOM (CONT’D) You gonna defend him now, huh? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT The coupe drifts slowly up the drive. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases. TOM I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... Tom opens the door. NICK No thanks. I'll wait outside. Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain. TOM What is the matter with you? Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick’s arm. JORDAN Won't you come in, Nick? NICK No... thanks. JORDAN It's only half past nine... NICK No. I think I’ve had enough... Of everyone. CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... GATSBY Hello old sport... Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy’s window. His pace quickens. NICK What are you doing!? GATSBY Just sitting here... NICK Yes, I can see that. GATSBY Did you see any trouble out on the road? NICK Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay! GATSBY I thought so... I told Daisy I thoughts so-- NICK Daisy? Do you hear yourself-- GATSBY Its better that the shock should come all at once-- NICK What’s wrong with you!? How could you!? GATSBY Please... Keep your voice down, old sport. NICK Tom was right! You’re nothing but a goddamn coward! GATSBY (threatening) Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping. NICK NO POINT!? GATSBY It, it killed her instantly. I-- NICK Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open! Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain... GATSBY I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel. NICK She? SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... Henri emerges. AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. Finally, Henri goes back in. CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization. NICK (CONT’D) It was Daisy? Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits. GATSBY You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us. CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel... GATSBY (CONT’D) It all happened so quickly. It wasn’t her fault... (MORE) GATSBY (CONT’D) It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel... (intense) No one must know. Promise me. No one. Promise me. NICK Jay-- You shouldn’t be here. You should get out of here. Gatsby gazes back to the house... GATSBY No. No. No. I’m going to wait. I’ll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy’s locked herself in her room, and she’s going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever-- NICK Tom won't touch her. He’s not even thinking about her... GATSBY Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don’t trust him. Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace. NICK Alright. Alright... You wait here. I’ll see if there’s any commotion. GATSBY Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Nick skirts the terrace... Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them. As Tom speaks intently and earnestly at Daisy, his hand falls gently upon hers and she nods tiredly in agreement... TOM Its going to be all right... Then, very slowly, Daisy lays her head on Tom’s shoulder. CLOSE ON: Nick, shocked... angry. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - NIGHT DISCOVER: Nick sitting, drinking from a bottle of whiskey... The sound of a car coming up Gatsby’s drive... INT. GATSBY'S GARAGE - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Gatsby cleaning blood from the Duesenberg’s fender. Nick appears, coming across the yard. NICK Jay? Everything alright...? Exhausted, Gatsby turns... GATSBY Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything’s just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... (beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was... NICK Jay... You oughtta go away. He helps Gatsby cover the car. NICK (CONT’D) Tonight. They’ll trace your car. GATSBY (as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can’t leave now. Not tonight. NICK Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? Nick follows him from the garage toward the house. GATSBY Daisy’s going to call in the morning. Then we’ll make plans, to go away together. NICK But Jay she-- Sensing Nick’s tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty. GATSBY She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She’ll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think. NICK Jay-- GATSBY She just needs to think. She’s going to call in the morning. Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... He turns to go in but stops. GATSBY (CONT’D) Wait up with me? The suns almost up... NICK (V.O.) That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - NIGHT Gatsby’s voice echoes through the empty halls of his vast, lonely mansion as he confesses... GATSBY You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I’m empty. (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) I suppose that’s why I make things up about myself... But I‘ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well-- As Gatbsy continues, Nick’s V.O. FADES UP: NICK (V.O.) He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he’d joined Wolfsheim in the business... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock. NICK (V.O.) It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby’s... extraordinary gift for hope. GATSBY ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. NICK (V.O.) A gift that I have never found in any other person... GATSBY I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. NICK (V.O.) And which it is not likely I shall ever find again. GATSBY I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... Finally, Nick is able to ask: NICK What was in the letter? Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... GATSBY The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn’t been able to return-- In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: “Daisy, the truth is... I’m penniless.” GATSBY (O.C.) (CONT’D) I asked her to wait until I’d made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure. The IMAGE of Daisy fades... GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, I felt married to her... That was all. NICK (V.O.) It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything. CUT TO: INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY CLOSE ON: A hand takes a revolver from a desk drawer... It is Wilson. FLOAT: Toward the window behind him... WE SEE the staring eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. WILSON God sees everything. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - MORNING Nick and Gatsby are finishing breakfast. HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir, excuse me, Chicago calling sir. GATSBY Now now. Keep it open. For a personal call... HERZOG A personal call? Of course. The GARDENER comes to the foot of the steps. GARDENER I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. GATSBY Not today. It’s so beautiful. (to Nick) You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer? Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) Let’s go for a swim. I’ll have the phone transferred to the pool... As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch... NICK Jay, I’ve got to go. I have to work. GATSBY I understand... Well, I’ll walk you out. Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate... NICK I'll call you up. GATSBY Do, old sport, please do. (a thought) I suppose Daisy'll call too. NICK I suppose so... Well... Goodbye. Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls: NICK (CONT’D) They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together! First Gatsby nods politely, and then his face breaks into that radiant and understanding smile. NICK (V.O.) I was always glad I said that... It was the only compliment I ever paid him. DISSOLVE TO: INT. PROBITY TRUST BUILDING - NICK’S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON: Nick, tired, sick-looking. NICK (V.O.) That morning, Wall Street boomed, its usual golden roar... But I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work. I waited for Gatsby to call with news... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - DAY Gatsby heads for the pool, ready to swim... NICK (V.O.) While he waited for Daisy... SPLASH! Gatsby dives gracefully into the pool. We see Gatsby from below, body gliding through clear water. INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAISY’S BEDROOM - DAY CLOSE ON: A white telephone on a ivory plinth. REVEAL: Daisy, considering the phone... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GROUNDS - DAY A gun dangles from a hand. Wilson’s scarecrow shadow ripples across the lawn. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - CONTINUOUS Gatsby’s head breaks the smooth, green surface of the water. SUDDENLY! BRRRING!!! The phone rings... Gatsby smiles and gazes across toward the green light, toward Daisy. PULL FOCUS: Atop the monumental stairs, Wilson, raises a gun. THE CRACK OF A GUNSHOT! CLOSE ON: Gatsby - a moment of strangled, startled, wonder... His lips form a final, breathless... GATSBY Daisy... Then his face hardens as he slowly falls backwards... SPLASH! Placing his gun in his mouth Wilson pulls the trigger. BANNNGG! INT. PROBITY TRUST BUILDING - NICK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS A SILENT IMAGE of Nick screaming into the phone. INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAISY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Daisy’s hand rests on the phone... She never called. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - DAY Gatsby’s body descends through a cloud of blood... NICK (V.O.) After all these years, I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day as an endless drill... Looking up from the bottom of the pool we see a crowd of staring faces and the pop of flashbulbs through water... NICK (V.O.) ...of police and photographers and tabloid reporters. (MORE) NICK (V.O.)

BUCHANAN MANSION - PORTICO - DAY TOP SHOT: Servants carry endless luggage through the hall, down the stairs, and out the front door... BRRIIING!!! A phone rings OFF-SCREEN. At the bottom of the stairs, DISCOVER: Daisy and Pammy. DAISY (explains to Pammy) Daddy’s taking care of his two favorite girls... BRRIIING!!! PAMMY But where are we going? DAISY Just for a little trip. Just you, me, and daddy... BRRIIING!!! Tom appears beside Daisy. TOM (tenderly) We should go. BRRIIING!!! Finally, at the top of the stairs, Henri answers. HENRI Buchanan residence. INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS DISCOVER: Nick sits atop the deco stairs, telephone in hand. Gatsby coffin is directly below...

BUCHANAN MANSION - PORTICO - CONTINUOUS Henri looks down to Tom, who shoots a “we’re not here” look. HENRI I’m sorry, but... They have gone away. NICK (O.S.) Gone away...?

GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS As Nick slowly, bitterly hangs up the telephone... NICK (V.O.) They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness... He looks to the throng of press swarming like vultures around Gatsby’s casket. Seized by fury, he snaps and screams as he advances down the stairs! NICK GET OUT! ALL OF YOU OUT! GET OUT...!!! DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT Time has passed. Nick sits on the steps slouched against the rail. He looks down to Gatsby’s still face, sad, alone... NICK (V.O.) I rang, I wrote, I implored... THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD GATSBY: NICK (V.O.) But not a single one of the sparkling hundreds who had enjoyed his hospitality all summer, attended the funeral... ECU: Gatsby. NICK (V.O.) And from Daisy, not even a flower. Distraught and exhausted, Nick’s eyes slowly close... NICK (V.O.) I was all he had; the only one who cared... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - SUMMER - MORNING Nick is sound asleep on the couch, his typewriter and dozens of type-filled pages in front of him. Clearly, he has been writing all night... The Doctor enters. He looks tenderly to Nick, and picks up a loose page from the floor... DISSOLVE THROUGH THE PAGE TO: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY Its winter now. The city is blanketed by an unforgiving, cold grey sky... NICK (V.O.) After Gatsby's death, New York was haunted for me... DISCOVER: Nick, a tumult of anger, grief and despair, wandering unshaven through a Fifth Avenue crowd... NICK (V.O.) That city... My once golden... shimmering mirage, now made me sick. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - EVENING DRIFT TOWARD: Gatsby’s castle, ghostly in the moonlight. NICK (V.O.) On my last night in New York... I returned to that huge, incoherent house once more. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT Very drunk, Nick trails over broken relics of lost grandeur, through rooms that have been stripped... NICK (V.O.) Wolfsheim’s 'associates' had cleaned the place out... ALL AROUND NICK: Ghostly images from Nick’s memory - from all those glittering parties, haunting snatches of music, laughter and conversation, imagery - mixing and FADING IN AND OUT... JORDAN He threw all those parties hoping she would wander in one night... NICK Its like an amusement park... DAISY But how do you live her all alone? GATSBY She makes it look so splendid, don’t you think, old sport? DAISY Music! And then we can dance all night... GATSBY Will you come old sport? We... need you. DAISY I wish it could always be like this... GATSBY It will be... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT Nick wanders out as a light rain beings to fall. NICK (V.O.) I remembered how we had all come to Gatsby’s, and guessed at his corruption... While he had stood before us concealing an incorruptible dream... A FINAL MEMORY: Gatsby and Daisy together on the dance- floor... Daisy leans in and whispers happily to Gatsby... DAISY Its perfect... From your perfect, irresistible imagination. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - NIGHT Nick stumbles along the dock; the rain falling steadily now. NICK (V.O.) The moon rose higher... And as I stood there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. Nick looks to the end of the dock, where he first saw Gatsby that warm summer night... NICK (V.O.) He had come such a long way... And suddenly, shimmering ghostly through the rain, Gatsby’s silhouette can be seen once more, gazing out across the bay. NICK (V.O.) And his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. Gatsby turns back towards Nick, and smiles... NICK (V.O.) He did not know that it was already behind him... Nick smiles back. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us...

This divide is personified through the juxtaposition of characters like Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby. Tom, born into wealth, exemplifies the arrogance and sense of entitlement inherent to the American upper class. His snide remarks, such as the derogatory \\"Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\\" directed at Gatsby, highlight the disdain the old money has for newcomers, no matter their wealth. In contrast, Gatsby, despite amassing a great fortune, is never fully accepted by the elite, his nouveau-riche status making him an eternal outsider. This class conflict orchestrates the tension in the narrative, showcasing the capitalist system's role in sustaining class divisions, where wealth accumulation does not necessarily grant one access to higher social echelons. # Commodification of Life The commodification of relationships and emotions is vividly depicted through Gatsby's lavish parties meant to attract Daisy's attention, portraying a society where interpersonal connections are secondary to material wealth and status. Gatsby's entire existence becomes a commodity; his identity, mansion, and parties are all constructs designed to win over Daisy, who herself is portrayed as a prize to be won. This concept resonates with Marx's theory of commodification, where under capitalism, not only goods but also individual identities and relationships are commodified. Daisy's comment on Gatsby's shirts, \\"I've never seen such beautiful shirts before,\\" symbolizes this commodification, equating Gatsby's worth with his possessions rather than his character. # The Illusion of the American Dream The film intricately explores the illusion of the American Dream, a central theme that aligns with the critique of capitalism. Gatsby embodies the self-made man myth, believing that wealth and determination can transcend his past and rewrite his future with Daisy. However, his tragic end underscores the unattainability of this dream, especially for those outside the traditional elite. Despite his efforts, Gatsby fails to breach the entrenched class barriers, revealing the American Dream's illusory nature in a capitalist society that privileges lineage over merit. Nick's reflection, \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us,\\" captures the perpetual chase after an unattainable ideal, symbolizing the harsh reality of socioeconomic mobility's limitations. # Conclusion Through a Marxist lens, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013) unravels the complexities of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the elusive nature of the American Dream in a capitalist society. The characters' interactions and dialogues, set against the backdrop of 1920s America, reflect the enduring nature of these themes, resonating with contemporary discussions on economic inequality and social mobility. Luhrmann’s adaptation not only retells Fitzgerald's story but also serves as a socio-political commentary on the capitalist dynamics that continue to shape American society. --- This analysis leverages direct quotations and dialogues from the \\"The Great Gatsby\\" film transcript as evidence for thematic exploration. To maintain academic rigor and coherence in line with the proposed methodology, the discussion integrates textual evidence while aligning with the stipulated word count constraints."},{"instruction":"make it longer with quotations from the transcript of the movie as a part of analysis. first, this part (differ the social class based on Marxist theory): Class Conflict The narrative of “The Great Gatsby” is steeped in the portrayal of class conflict, underlining the chasm between the ‘old money’ elite and the ‘new money’ individuals striving for acceptance. This divide is personified through the juxtaposition of characters like Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby. Tom, born into wealth, exemplifies the arrogance and sense of entitlement inherent to the American upper class.

This class conflict orchestrates the tension in the narrative, showcasing the capitalist system’s role in sustaining class divisions, where wealth accumulation does not necessarily grant one access to higher social echelons.","output":"Expanding on the theme of Class Conflict in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), let us dive deeper into the quotations from the movie that underline the marked division and discord between classes through the lens of Marxist theory. The societal rift is palpable when Tom Buchanan sneeringly addresses Gatsby as “Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\\". This dismissive attitude not only aims to belittle Gatsby but also serves as a gatekeeping mechanism to maintain distance between the established wealth of old money and the aspiring members of the new money echelon. It's a reinforcement of the idea that no amount of wealth can buy the heritage and status that come with being born into the aristocracy of America. Gatsby's response to this classist snub, though silent, is significant. He continues to pursue his dream with the hope that his amassed wealth can indeed translate into social acceptance. His parties, described by Nick as events where \\"the parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser,\\" are not just celebrations but strategic investments into Gatsby's social capital. They are Gatsby's way of displaying his economic power, in hopes of bridging the gap between himself and the old money elite. However, the futility of Gatsby's efforts is underscored in a conversation he has with Nick, wherein he reveals his background: “You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well...”. In this dialogue, Gatsby's acknowledgement of his humble beginnings to Nick illustrates the depth of his aspiration and also the magnitude of the social divide he is attempting to cross. This disclosure to Nick, a character who straddles both worlds but belongs fully to neither, serves as a poignant reminder of the immutable barriers erected by class distinctions. Moreover, Tom's interrogation of Gatsby’s educational background is a stark example of the elite's skepticism towards the legitimacy of new money’s cultural capital. When Gatsby admits to not being \\"exactly\\" an Oxford man, Tom's incredulous laughter, \\"Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford!\\" not only undermines Gatsby’s achievements but also invalidates his attempts to culturally align with the upper class. This scene acts as a microcosm of the broader societal dismissal and gatekeeping faced by those attempting to transcend their class origins. In addition, Daisy’s oscillation between Tom and Gatsby symbolizes the conflict between secure, inherited wealth and the precarious, self-made fortune. Her ultimate choice to remain with Tom reinforces the notion that the security and familiarity of old money hold more value in their social world than the uncertain potential of new wealth. Her decision, indirectly influenced by societal norms and pressures, underlines the harsh reality that the American Dream, as chased by Gatsby, is unattainable for those not born into privilege. Thus, through these interactions and dialogues, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" effectively critiques the classist underpinnings of the American Dream and exposes the capitalist system's role in perpetuating class divisions. It illustrates that in a society governed by capital, economic success does not equate to social mobility, and the barriers between classes remain insurmountable, underlined by Marx’s contention that class conflict is an inherent and defining characteristic of capitalist societies."},{"instruction":"make it longer with quotations from the transcript of the movie as a part of analysis. second, this part (refer to marxism, neo-marxism theory to strengthen this): Commodification of Life The commodification of relationships and emotions is vividly depicted through Gatsby’s lavish parties meant to attract Daisy’s attention, portraying a society where interpersonal connections are secondary to material wealth and status. Gatsby’s entire existence becomes a commodity; his identity, mansion, and parties are all constructs designed to win over Daisy, who herself is portrayed as a prize to be won. This concept resonates with Marx’s theory of commodification, where under capitalism, not only goods but also individual identities and relationships are commodified. Daisy’s comment on Gatsby’s shirts, “I’ve never seen such beautiful shirts before,” symbolizes this commodification, equating Gatsby’s worth with his possessions rather than his character.","output":"Delving into the theme of Commodification of Life within \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), the dialogue and the narrative serve as foundational illustrations of Marxist theories on commodification and in turn, resonate with the Neo-Marxist critique of capitalism's reach into personal and emotional realms of human existence. From the outset, Gatsby’s lavish parties signal a clear intent to commodify social connections for personal gain. Nick Carraway describes these events: “The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser,” underscoring the superficiality that pervades Gatsby's world. These parties, ostensibly gatherings of joy and socialization, are in reality marketplaces where relationships are transactions, and emotions are commodities to be traded for social ascension. Gatsby's interaction with his guests is not driven by genuine connection but by his desire to use these social constructs as a ladder to escape his nouveau-riche status and be acknowledged by the old wealth elite. Gatsby’s dialogue, though often sparse, reveals his internal commodification of Daisy. He confesses to Nick, “She’s got to tell [Tom] she never loved him...and then we can go back to the start.” In Gatsby’s perception, Daisy’s love is a transaction that needs to be clarified, a deal to be closed to restore his perceived right to possess her completely. His relentless pursuit transforms Daisy, in his eyes, into an ultimate prize that signifies the culmination of American success – the attainment of a desirable object that epitomizes wealth, status, and accomplishment. This notion is further reflected in Daisy's awe of Gatsby’s material possessions, notably when she weeps over his pile of shirts, illustrating how Gatsby’s wealth and the things he owns become a direct measure of his value in her eyes. Moreover, the portrayal of Myrtle Wilson and her relationship with Tom Buchanan exemplifies the commodification of individuals based on their utility. Myrtle is presented as an object of desirability to Tom, valued not for her personhood but for her role as an escape from his dispassionate marriage. This dynamic is vividly highlighted when Nick narrates, “Tom’s got some woman in New York,” reducing Myrtle to a mere “woman” - a possession or commodity rather than a person with agency and dignity. The film, through these characters and their interactions, exemplifies Marx’s assertion that under capitalism, social relationships, and human values are subjected to commodification – reducing personal relations to economic transactions and human value to material worth. Through a Neo-Marxist lens, this goes beyond economic commodification to highlight a culture where capitalism has permeated personal identity and human relationships to such an extent that individuals commodify their selves and others to navigate the social landscape defined by capital. Gatsby's failed attempt to reclaim his past with Daisy through wealth and spectacle ultimately underscores the hollowness at the heart of the commodification of life. It reveals the tragedy of a world where genuine human connections are subordinated to the pursuit of material and status, a world where everything can be bought and sold, except, as Gatsby discovers, the past and true love. This narrative aligns with the Neo-Marxist critique of capitalism, emphasizing the loss of human essence in the face of commodified relationships and identities."},{"instruction":"при запуске nginx выдает ошибку error code","output":"Ошибка \\"error code\\" в nginx без конкретного описания или номера ошибки делает поиск решения сложным, так как причин может быть множество. Однако, есть несколько общих шагов, которые можно предпринять, чтобы попытаться исправить эту проблему или хотя бы уточнить её: 1. **Проверьте логи nginx**: Ошибка должна быть залогирована в файле ошибок nginx. По умолчанию, лог ошибок находится в \`/var/log/nginx/error.log\` (путь может отличаться в зависимости от вашей операционной системы или конфигурации). Посмотрите последние строки лога на предмет конкретных сообщений об ошибке, которые могут указывать на причину проблемы. 2. **Проверьте конфигурационный файл nginx**: Ошибка могла возникнуть из-за проблемы в конфигурации. Выполните команду \`nginx -t\` или \`nginx -T\` (для более подробного вывода), чтобы проверить синтаксис и убедиться, что нет ошибок. Система должна выдать сообщение либо о том, что конфигурация в порядке, либо указать на конкретные строки и файлы, где обнаружены ошибки. 3. **Проверьте наличие дубликатов настроек**: Иногда проблема может возникать из-за дублирования настроек, таких как двойное объявление порта в разных конфигурационных файлах. Убедитесь, что вы не прописали одни и те же настройки в разных местах. 4. **Проверьте порты**: Если ошибка связана с сетью, убедитесь, что порт, который вы пытаетесь использовать для nginx, не занят другим процессом. Вы можете использовать команду \`sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :80\` (замените 80 на нужный вам порт), чтобы проверить, занят ли порт. 5. **Перезапуск nginx**: После исправления проблемы с конфигурацией или других возможных причин проблемы попробуйте перезапустить nginx с помощью команды \`sudo systemctl restart nginx\` на системах с systemd или \`sudo service nginx restart\` на других системах. 6. **Обращение за помощью**: Если ни один из вышеперечисленных методов не сработал, вероятно, вам потребуется более конкретная помощь. Рассмотрите возможность обращения на форумы, посвященные nginx или Linux, где вы сможете предоставить конкретные логи ошибок и получить более целенаправленные советы. Помните, что очень важно предоставить как можно больше контекста и информации об ошибке, если вы обращаетесь за помощью в сообществах или форумах. Это включает версии софта, операционной системы, конкретные сообщения об ошибках и выдержки из конфигурационных файлов (с замазанными чувствительными данными)."},{"instruction":"не запускается nginx командой systemctl enable nginx","output":"Если Nginx не запускается с помощью команды \`systemctl enable nginx\`, это может указывать на несколько возможных проблем. Стоит иметь в виду, что команда \`systemctl enable nginx\` предназначена не для запуска службы, а для её включения в автоматическую загрузку при старте системы. Для запуска службы используется команда \`systemctl start nginx\`. Вот несколько шагов, которые помогут выявить и решить проблему: 1. **Проверьте состояние nginx**: Прежде всего, убедитесь, что проблема действительно существует. Попробуйте запустить Nginx командой \`sudo systemctl start nginx\`, а затем проверьте статус службы командой \`sudo systemctl status nginx\`. Это покажет, активен ли Nginx и работает ли он корректно. 2. **Используйте команды в правильном порядке**: - Сначала включите автоматическую загрузку при старте системы: \`sudo systemctl enable nginx\` - Затем запустите Nginx: \`sudo systemctl start nginx\` 3. **Проверьте журналы на наличие ошибок**: - Посмотрите логи Nginx (например, \`/var/log/nginx/error.log\`), чтобы найти возможные сообщения об ошибках. - Проверьте системные журналы, использовав команду \`journalctl -u nginx\`. Это может предоставить подсказки о том, почему Nginx не смог запуститься. 4. **Проверьте конфигурацию Nginx**: - Убедитесь, что синтаксис конфигурационного файла корректен, используя команду \`sudo nginx -t\`. Это проверит конфигурацию на наличие синтаксических ошибок и предупредит вас, если найдет что-либо неправильное. 5. **Проверьте, не занят ли порт**: - Если вы используете стандартный порт (80 для HTTP или 443 для HTTPS), убедитесь, что другой процесс не использует эти порты. Это можно проверить, используя команду \`sudo netstat -tuln | grep :80\` или изменяя \`80\` на любой другой порт, который вы пытаетесь использовать. 6. **Проверьте права доступа**: - Убедитесь, что у вас есть соответствующие права для чтения конфигурационных файлов и доступа к соответствующим путям. Некорректные разрешения могут препятствовать успешному запуску Nginx. 7. **Перезагрузите systemd**: - Если вы недавно установили или обновили Nginx, может потребоваться перезагрузить демон systemd, чтобы он заново прочитал все измененные юнит-файлы. Это можно сделать командой \`sudo systemctl daemon-reload\`. После этого повторите попытку включения и запуска Nginx. 8. **Перезапуск системы**: - Если ничего не помогает, попробуйте перезагрузить ваш сервер или компьютер. Иногда перезагрузка может решить проблему, особенно если произошли изменения в системных настройках или установлены новые обновления, которые не вступили в силу. Если проблема не решена после выполнения вышеперечисленных шагов, рекомендую искать конкретное сообщение об ошибке в логах или статусе службы и искать решение с учетом этой информации."},{"instruction":"today i create a patreon page. on my page i will share my ai genareated Anime/Hentai NSFW stuff. so i need BIO for my patreon. can u create for me a bio","output":"Sure!

However, a particular pond, nestled like a sparkling jewel amid the greenery, was about to become the stage for a moment both comedic and curiously endearing. Enter our protagonist, a Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army, known by his companions for both his valor in battle and his uncanny ability to lighten the dreariest of moods. This morning, he sought the secluded pond for a much-needed, albeit unconventional, bath. Stripping down to his very essence, he revealed a physique that was both a testament to his Scottish heritage and the rigorous demands of military life. Muscles honed by endless drills and marches played under his fair, freckle-dotted skin, gleaming like polished bronze in the dappled sunlight that broke through the canopy above. His hair, a wild cascade of fiery-red, partially tamed into a rough ponytail, had a rebellious few strands curling around his broad shoulders, catching the morning light as if ablaze. Yet, it was perhaps the sight of his posterior, as he waded waist-deep into the crystal waters, that would remain etched in the minds of any unsuspecting voyeur. Firm and unyielding, it was a fitting testament to the countless miles marched and the burdens borne across rugged terrains, a nod to his Highland strength and resilience. Midway in his ablutions, the Grenadier paused, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. He glanced over his shoulder, ensuring solitude, then positioned himself strategically, determined to embrace the day with the same fervor with which he faced his adversaries. With a concerted effort that engaged his formidable physique, he released into the water what could only be described as a monumental fart, his expression a delightful mix of concentration and glee. \\"Ah, lads, if only ye could witnessthis!\\" he chuckled to himself, watching as the pond's serene surface was momentarily disturbed by bubbles emerging in a hasty retreat from their source. No sooner had the ripples spread than a few unfortunate fish surfaced, their demise evidently hastened by the potent brew of the Highlander's making. \\"Blimey, I knew I was full of hot air, but to think I'd turn fisherman wit’ nothing but me arse!\\" he exclaimed with a hearty laugh, the sound echoing through the trees, startling a flock of birds into flight. As he continued his bath, he mused aloud, \\"I wager these waters haven't seen the likes of such a spectacle since we Scots learned to swim by outpacing Nessie herself. Perhaps this will start a new legend, eh? The mysterious beast of the pond, terrorizing fish with naught but its stench!\\" His laughter mingled with the natural chorus of the forest as he finished his unconventional bath, stepping from the pond refreshed, not just in body but in spirit. \\"A battle might wait on the morrow, but today, I’ve conquered the pond in my own, indelible way,\\" he quipped, a grin spreading across his features as he donned his uniform once again, ready to face whatever the day might bring with the same unyielding audacity. And so, the tale of the Highlander Grenadier and his peculiar method of fishing would weave itself into the fabric of the unit's lore, recounted around campfires and in taverns, a mirthful memory of a moment caught between the struggles of war and the enduring resilience of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"in this js code how to access state from event listener class Game { this.state = { x: 0 }","output":"The snippet you've provided doesn't represent valid JavaScript syntax for class definition or adding event listeners. However, I'll guide you through a correct approach to define a class, set an initial state, and access that state from an event listener. First, ensure to properly define your class properties inside a constructor and use methods to incorporate behaviors, including setting up event listeners. For instance: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { x: 0 }; // Bind the this context for the event handler if you plan to use 'this' inside the handler this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); } // Method to increase x in the state incrementX() { this.state.x += 1; console.log(this.state.x); } // Handle click event handleClick() { // Access state directly since 'this' is bound to the instance this.incrementX(); } // Method to set up an event listener setupEventListener() { // For example, setting up a click event listener on the document body // Ensure this.handleClick has the Game instance context document.body.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick); } } // Create an instance of the Game class const myGame = new Game(); // Setup the event listener for the instance myGame.setupEventListener(); \`\`\` In this example: 1. A new \`Game\` class is defined with a constructor initializing the state with \`{ x: 0 }\`. 2. A method \`incrementX\` is created to modify the state property \`x\`. 3. Another method, \`handleClick\`, is defined as an event handler that will call \`incrementX\` upon being triggered, such as on a click. This demonstrates how to access and modify the state inside an event handler. 4. The \`setupEventListener\` method adds a click event listener to the document's body, using \`handleClick\` as the callback. By previously binding \`this.handleClick\` in the constructor, it ensures the context of \`this\` within \`handleClick\` refers to the \`Game\` instance, thus allowing access to \`this.state\` and any other properties or methods. This setup performs a crucial step needed in class-based event handlers in JavaScript: the use of \`.bind(this)\` to ensure the callback function retains the correct context for \`this\`. Without it, \`this\` inside your callback refers to the object that triggered the event (for instance, \`document.body\` if the event listener was attached there), not the class instance, and you would not be able to access the state directly."},{"instruction":"is primarily involved in the coordination of somatic motor functions, which means principally skeletal muscle contractions.target 9 of 11 Blank is a complex structure composed of multiple nuclei.

To access \`state\` from within the event listener, you need to ensure the function has the correct reference to \`this\`—the instance of the class. There are a few different ways to handle this. One common approach is to use an arrow function since arrow functions do not have their own \`this\` and inherit \`this\` from the surrounding lexical context. Another approach is to bind the function explicitly to \`this\` using \`bind()\`. Here's how you could adjust your class to make it work with an arrow function: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { phase: \\"aiming\\", }; // Assuming bombGrabAreaDOM is accessible and defined bombGrabAreaDOM.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", (e) => { // Arrow function inherits \`this\` from the constructor console.log(this.state.phase); // You can access state here }); } } \`\`\` And here's how you could do it with \`bind()\`: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { phase: \\"aiming\\", }; // Explicitly bind \`this\` to the function bombGrabAreaDOM.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", this.handleMouseDown.bind(this)); } handleMouseDown(e) { console.log(this.state.phase); // You can access state here } } \`\`\` Note, for the examples above to work, \`bombGrabAreaDOM\` must be defined and accessible. You could define it outside the class, pass it to the class constructor, or query it inside the constructor. For instance, if \`bombGrabAreaDOM\` is an element in the DOM with a unique ID, you can query it inside the constructor like this: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { phase: \\"aiming\\", }; const bombGrabAreaDOM = document.getElementById(\\"yourElementId\\"); bombGrabAreaDOM.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", (e) => { console.log(this.state.phase); }); } } \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`\\"yourElementId\\"\` with the actual ID of the element you wish to attach the event listener to."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The international stage was set ablaze with hostilities, particularly focusing its inferno in the volcanic regions of Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. **2035:** This year heralded the ominous expansion of aggressive postures into open hostilities, the seeds of which were unwittingly sown to grow into the ultimate conflagration of human conflict, a war that would, in grim irony, herald an end to all wars on the earthly plane. **2037:** The world was thrust into the throes of World War III, a sprawling chessboard of strife that saw knights and pawns clash from the icy ramparts of Alaska to the desolate, mine-strewn deserts of the Sahara. The globe became an arena for the symphony of war, its movements chaotic and its harmony discordant. **2042 (The Year of Nuclear Fire):** Amidst the cacophony of continuous warfare, a dare long dangled by North Korea was finally fulfilled. Decades of nuclear brinkmanship culminated in a devastating reality, as London, Washington D.C., Tokyo, and other major cities worldwide were swallowed by a voracious inferno of atomic wrath. **2042 (Retaliation Unleashed):** The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pushed to the brink of despair, unleashed its own arsenal of nuclear wrath upon key strategic and civilian locales deemed enemy strongholds. This catastrophic exchange of apocalyptic might cleaved the human population by nearly half, an unimaginable culling by fire and fury. **2044 (The Scourge Unearthed):** As if the nuclear armageddon was not sufficient retribution against humanity's hubris, a new specter of death emerged in the form of a relentless plague. With its incurably devastating effects and a resilience that mocked all attempts at containment, the scourge seemed to spell the final chapter for human civilization. **2050:** By the grim dawn of 2050, the Earth's population, once a testament to human prosperity and growth in 2038, was now a shadow of its former self. Less than a third of mankind remained, the rest having been claimed by war, disease, and the natural attrition of a world unconcerned with human plight. **2054 (The Fractured Armistice):** Amid the desolation and ruin, the fragmented remnants of nations and factions, driven by desperation and the stark realization of their impending extinction, forged a precarious detente. This truce, born of necessity, was a faint glimmer of hope in the shadow of annihilation. **[The Ascension of Desperation]** **2055:** Out of the ashes of despair, an unexpected phoenix arose. Humanity, faced with its own mortality and the shattered remnants of its world, turned once again to the divine. The period marked the birth of the \\"doomspires,\\" monumental edifices constructed from multi-hued bricks. These towering temples, stretching towards the heavens, were a plea to Blox, a beacon of hope in a world devoid of it. **[The Silence Before the Storm]** **[No records survive from 2055 until the dawn of 2099.]** In this era of unrecorded history, humanity perhaps waged its greatest battle, not against each other, but for survival against the very consequences of their former hubris.

He decides whether to cook them for his dinner. add dialogue from the Grenadier throughout the story","output":"In the midst of the green expanse of the colonial Americas, where trees stood tall and the air thrummed with the sounds of nature and nascent rebellion, there was a Highland Grenadier named Angus MacFergus. Angus was a peculiar sight in these woods, a tower of a man with hair red as the fieriest sunset, cascading down his broad shoulders in wild, untamed waves. His physique, a testament to the harsh training and Highland life, was a mixture of brawn and sheer brute strength, sculpted by years of wielding his musket and the heavy grenadier bearskin cap that now lay discarded on the grassy bank, far from the water's edge where Angus ventured for a much-needed wash. Wading waist-deep into the cool embrace of a secluded pond, Angus was in his element, free from the constrictions of his uniform and the war that seemed a world away. The water, a refreshing respite, lapped against his sun-kissed skin, marked by the occasional battle scar. As the sunlight pierced through the canopy, it illuminated his form, casting a heroic yet comical silhouette. Focussing on the task at hand, Angus began a thorough scrub, his strong hands working to dislodge the grime of battle and march. Suddenly, feeling a gaseous bubble brewing from within, Angus, with a mischievous glint in his eye, remarked to himself, \\"Ready yerselves, lads, for a blast that'll rival the cannons of Lexington!\\" With a cheeky grin, he positioned himself, leaning slightly forward for maximum effect, and released a mighty fart into the pond. The resulting bubbles rushed to the surface, carrying with them a few unlucky fish that were rendered lifeless from the odorous assault. Angus, unabashed and quite pleased with his aquatic achievements, bellowed with laughter, his echoes filling the forest around him. \\"Oh, what’s this? Dinner served by the very cheeks that would scare off the British!\\" Angus amused himself with the sight, his rear now immortalized in the annals of unconventional fishing methods. Inspecting the floating fish, Angus debated his culinary options. \\"Do I dare dine on the fruits of me own...eruption? Aye, waste not, want not, as Ma used to say.\\" With a shrug, he waded out of the pond, his physique glistening and every bit the image of a rugged yet oddly endearing warrior. As he set about preparing his impromptu meal, Angus couldn't help but chuckle at the day's turn of events. \\"Who would've thought the mighty Angus MacFergus, feared by men, would be brought to cooking fish felled by naught but the power of his own backside?\\" Cooking over a makeshift fire, the aroma of grilled fish filled the air, a stark contrast to the earlier scent that dominated the pond. Angus took a hearty bite, his taste buds dancing to the flavors of his unusual catch. \\"Ah, not bad at all! Perhaps I've found me a new calling. Angus MacFergus: the first grenadier gourmand!\\" As night fell, Angus, satiated and content, looked up at the stars, his laughter mingling with the crackling of the fire. In the heart of colonial America, amidst the upheaval and chaos, a lone Highlander had found a moment of joy and absurdity, a tale that would surely baffle and entertain for generations to come. And so, the legend of Angus \\"The Fartriotic Chef\\" MacFergus was born, a story of resilience, resourcefulness, and the inexplicable ways of warfare and wind."},{"instruction":"For a board game based of Hl2, detail the abilities and stats of each character piece.","output":"Creating a board game based on Half-Life 2 (HL2) offers a rich palette of characters and lore to draw from.

Funciona como um livro-razão digital distribuído onde cada bloco de informação está interligado e criptografado, garantindo a integridade dos dados. No contexto do vinho, isso significa que cada etapa do processo de produção e distribuição pode ser registrada na blockchain de forma segura e imutável. Isso inclui: 1. **Detalhes sobre a origem das uvas**: Local exato de cultivo, varietal, práticas de cultivo (orgânicas, biodinâmicas), e até mesmo condições climáticas específicas da safra. 2. **Processo de vinificação**: Datas de colheita, métodos de fermentação e envelhecimento, e informações sobre engarrafamento. 3. **Cadeia de custódia**: Registros de como o vinho foi transportado, armazenado e manuseado em cada etapa, desde a adega até as prateleiras dos vendedores. 4. **Autenticidade e propriedade**: Dados sobre autenticidade, incluindo a verificação de rótulos e tampas, e o histórico de propriedade, facilitando a verificação por parte dos colecionadores e investidores. A implementação da blockchain no setor vinícola oferece várias vantagens: - **Combate à falsificação**: Com a crescente preocupação sobre a falsificação de vinhos, especialmente os de alto valor, a blockchain garante a autenticidade do vinho ao permitir que os consumidores verifiquem cada etapa do seu histórico. - **Transparência**: Consumidores podem acessar facilmente informações detalhadas sobre a origem do vinho, seus processos de produção e sua jornada até chegar a eles, aumentando a confiança na marca e no produto. - **Eficiência na cadeia de suprimentos**: A tecnologia pode melhorar a eficiência logística, reduzindo custos e erros operacionais, além de facilitar recalls de produtos, se necessário. - **Valorização do produto**: Vinhos com registro completo de sua produção e história podem alcançar maior valorização no mercado, beneficiando produtores e vendedores. - **Mercado secundário e colecionismo**: Para investidores e colecionadores de vinho, a blockchain oferece uma ferramenta poderosa para certificar a proveniência e propriedade de garrafas raras, potencialmente aumentando seu valor. Em resumo, a expressão \\"blockchain para o vinho\\" simboliza a união entre uma das mais antigas tradições culturais da humanidade e uma das mais inovadoras tecnologias digitais, prometendo revolucionar a forma como produzimos, comercializamos e consumimos vinho, ao garantir autenticidade, qualidade e confiança em cada garrafa."},{"instruction":"Gostaria que você fizesse um texto com introdução, conteúdo e finalização, abordando o tema perfil dos novos consumidores e o Marketing digital","output":"# Introdução: Na era digital, a transformação dos hábitos de consumo alterou profundamente o cenário tradicional de vários setores, incluindo o marketing.

However, since there's a need for an additional step to convert operands and operators into a \`named_expr\`, and then into prefix tokens without using direct recursion, this becomes a trickier scenario under the given constraints. Based on this, the solution can only be implied conceptually within those rules because direct implementation requires careful crafting beyond typical usage scenarios, especially without recursion or direct calls to structures parse \`op_expr\` format. However, let's conceptualize a solution pathway assuming there exists a way to translate \`op_expr\` forms into \`named_expr\` without breaking the constraints given, starting with leveraging \`named_to_op_expr/2\` and \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`: 1. **Convert \`op_expr\` to \`named_expr\`:** This step would involve translating \`+(A, B)\` into \`add(A, B)\` and \`*(A, B)\` into \`mul(A, B)\`. Considering the constraints, there's a need for an intermediary representation or strategy to bridge this without direct use of recursion. 2. **Use \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` for the conversion to prefix tokens:** Once in \`named_expr\` format, the existing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` can be employed to produce the intended prefix notation tokens list. Creating this intermediary step defies the simple resolution path given the \\"no recursion and no Prolog built-ins\\" rules. In actual implementation within these boundaries, a creative workaround is crucial. One theoretically possible method could involve dynamically rewriting expressions into a format that can be indirectly processed by \`named_to_op_expr/2\` (in reverse usage or logically implied manner) and then passed to \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. However, considering the direct solution isn't provided, and the challenging nature of these restrictions, the ideal method would involve revisiting the constraints to allow minimal logical recursion or controlled usage of built-ins for parsing, thus facilitating a more straightforward and feasible pathway to solution under Prolog's declarative paradigm. Given this, no direct implementation is provided here, but rather a conceptual pathway suggesting a complex multi-step conversion process necessary under the restrictive conditions posed."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in colonial America of a Highlander Grenadier in the Continental Army washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

He decides whether to take them for his dinner. add dialogue from the Grenadier throughout the story","output":"In the verdant, untamed wilderness that would one day be treasured as a corner of America's heartland, there flowed a pond as clear as glass, cradled by the embracing arms of towering oaks and whispering willows. On this particular day, as the sun rode high in the azure heavens, the serene stillness of nature was about to be comically disturbed by the exploits of Angus McFadden, a Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army with a reputation for mischief as grand as the Highlands themselves. Angus, a towering figure of a man, with the sort of brawn sculpted not in the gymnasiums of the modern age but in the harsh and unforgiving gyms of life and warfare, had decided it was time for a bath. Not one for modesty, he stripped down in the buff, revealing a physique that was a testament to his Scottish roots and the physical demands of his role. His hair, a fiery cascade of red, flowed down his back, catching the sunlight and almost sparkling with a life of its own. As he waded waist-deep into the reflective surface of the pond, Angus took a moment to revel in the cooling embrace of the water, letting out a contented sigh that seemed to say, \\"Aye, this is the life.\\" Unbeknownst to most, Angus had a cheeky side that often saw the light of day in the most unexpected moments. Finding himself alone in the bosom of nature, Angus decided it was the perfect moment to partake in one of life's simplest pleasures—a hearty fart. With a mischievous grin stretching across his rugged features, he squatted slightly, bracing himself against the gentle resistance of the water. The effort on his face was both comedic and slightly heroic, as if he were engaging in a battle only he could understand. Then, with the force of a small cannon, Angus let rip a fart that echoed off the surrounding trees with a reverberation that seemed to momentarily pause the natural order. As he stood to admire his handiwork, the resulting bubbles furiously ascended to the pond's surface, carrying with them a stench so potent that Angus himself couldn't help but chuckle, \\"Och, that'll slay more redcoats than my musket!\\" As the ripples of his endeavor dispersed, Angus noticed a few motionless fish floating belly-up, victims of his devastatingly potent gas. With a bemused twinkle in his eye, he said aloud to the deceased fish, \\"Apologies, lads. I didna mean to wage chemical warfare on ye.\\" The sight of the dead fish presented a dilemma; should he gather them for his supper? After scrutinizing them for a moment, Angus decided against it, reasoning with a hearty laugh, \\"Nae, I'll not have my dinner be something that succumbed to the might of my backside. That's no way for a warrior to meet his end.\\" With his cleaning and comedy concluded, Angus waded back to the shore, leaving the pond's tranquility forever altered by his presence. As he dressed, he couldn't resist one final jest, \\"Tales of my exploits shall spread across this land, from sea to shining sea. Let them speak of the day when Angus McFadden defeated the British and a school of innocent fish with naught but the power of his posterior!\\" And so, clad once more in his Grenadier uniform, Angus McFadden set off back to camp, leaving behind a story that would be whispered and chuckled over around campfires for many nights to come. The tale of the Highlander and his lethal gas would quickly become the stuff of legend, a humorous anecdote in the saga of America's birth, demonstrating that even in times of strife, humanity's ability to find humor in the absurdity of life remains undiminished."},{"instruction":"Software Restriction Policies","output":"Software Restriction Policies (SRP) are a set of rules and configurations that can be implemented on a Windows operating system to control which software programs can be run on a computer.

Angus McFart, as legend had it, was a man of considerable stature, with hair as wild as the untamed forests that sprawled across the newborn nation. His locks, a fiery red cascade, tumbled down his broad shoulders, catching sunlight and turning it into a spectacle of gleaming copper. From beneath rugged brows, his blue eyes sparkled with mirth, a stark contrast to his fearsome appearance. Angus was built like the highlands he hailed from—towering and imposing with muscles honed by battle and the rugged life of a soldier. His rear, much like the rest of him, was as firm and round as the cannonballs he lobbed at the British, a fact that he was oddly proud of. One warm afternoon, amidst the ongoing tussle for freedom, Angus decided to partake in a rather primitive yet deeply satisfying ritual—to cleanse himself in a secluded pond, away from the prying eyes and the stifling formalities of the army camp. Stripping down to his very essence, he left his garments on the bank and waded waist-deep into the clear waters, the cool embrace of nature washing over him. Hardened by battles and the harsh Highland environment, his skin bore the tales of countless skirmishes—yet in this moment, he was but a man, indulging in life’s simpler pleasures. As Angus began to scrub the grime of warfare from his body, a wicked idea took form. His diet, a robust concoction of beans, meats, and whatever else could be foraged or afforded, had brewed a storm within his belly—a storm that now sought release. Positioning himself with a gleeful grin, he flexed his might and let out a formidable fart, the sound echoing through the trees like the call of a wild beast. \\"Heh, take that, ya blasted redcoats!\\" he chortled, the ripples carrying his battle cry across the pond. To his amusement, the act wasn’t without consequence. A few moments later, the surface of the pond betrayed the presence of unintended casualties—dead fish, floating belly-up, victims of the potent stench that had erupted from Angus's nether regions. \\"Blimey,\\" Angus exclaimed, scratching his head as he regarded the floating fish. \\"Didn’ mean to start me own rebellion in the pond, but a man’s gotta eat, aye?\\" Contemplating the sight, Angus deliberated the practicalities of waste not, want not. \\"Well, look at that, nature’s providence! Saved me the trouble of fishin’, didn' it?\\" he mused aloud, the corners of his mouth twitching into a smirk. With a shrug of his broad shoulders, succumbing to the pragmatic side of a soldier's life, he decided to salvage the fish for his dinner. \\"McFart’s catch of the day, served fresh! Hah, if this soldierin’ business goes awry, I reckon I’d make a fine fisherman, suffocatin’ the sea with nothing but the power of me arse!\\" Angus laughed heartily at the thought, his laughter mingling with the sounds of the wilderness. Gathering the fish with a certain efficiency, he emerged from the pond, his physique glistening under the sun, a testament to the raw force and vitality of a man who, despite the tumultuous times, found moments of amusement and joy. As he dressed, slipping into his uniform, a sense of satisfaction filled him—not just for the meal secured in such an unconventional manner, but for the reminder that even in the direst of circumstances, life offered opportunities for laughter and levity. \\"Tonight, me lads will dine on the finest fare, courtesy of Angus’s arse. May it be as victorious over hunger as we are over tyranny!\\" Angus declared, a wide grin plastered across his face as he made his way back to camp, the dead fish in tow and a tale that would soon become legend among the ranks of the Continental Army. Thus, in the heart of colonial America, amidst the turmoil and the striving for a nation's birthright, Angus McFart, Highlander Grenadier, fashioned a moment of comedic relief—a reminder that freedom, in all its facets, includes the liberty to laugh, even if it's at one's own posterior exploits."},{"instruction":"I have an interview for a project assistant posion in an international NGO in syria what questions should I prepare myself for?","output":"When preparing for an interview as a Project Assistant in an international NGO, especially in a complex and sensitive environment like Syria, it's crucial to anticipate a range of questions.

What was your role, and what was the outcome?\\"","output":"Answering a question about a specific project you managed or were part of allows you to showcase your experience, skills, and contributions clearly and convincingly. The best way to structure your answer is by employing the STAR method, which stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. This approach helps you deliver a comprehensive and structured response. Here's how you can use the STAR method to answer this question effectively: # Situation Begin by setting the context. Describe the project briefly, including its objectives, scope, and significance. This gives the interviewer a clear understanding of what you were dealing with and why the project was initiated. **Example**: \\"In my previous role as a project coordinator, I was part of a team responsible for developing a water sanitation project in a remote area. The goal was to improve access to clean water for over 10,000 residents, addressing significant health issues caused by waterborne diseases.\\" # Task Explain your specific responsibilities within the project. This shows your role and the expectations placed upon you. **Example**: \\"I was tasked with overseeing the on-the-ground implementation of the project, which included coordinating the work schedules, managing the project budget, and liaising with local community leaders to ensure the project met the community's needs.\\" # Action Detail the actions you took to address the tasks assigned to you. This is the heart of your answer, where you demonstrate your problem-solving abilities, leadership, teamwork, and any other skills relevant to the project and your role. **Example**: \\"To ensure the project's success, I established a detailed project timeline in consultation with engineers and the community, implemented a weekly review system to track progress against goals, and led a team of local workers. I also organized community meetings to keep the residents informed and involved in the project, addressing their concerns and incorporating their feedback where practical.\\" # Result Conclude by sharing the outcome of the project and, importantly, your actions' impact. This highlights the value you added and the skills you can bring to the new role. **Example**: \\"The project was completed three weeks ahead of schedule and under budget. We successfully installed new water sanitation facilities, which led to a 60% reduction in waterborne diseases in the community within the first six months. Additionally, the project received positive coverage in local media and raised the profile of our organization's work in the region. My role in budget management and community engagement was specifically commended by my project manager.\\" # Additional Tips - Be honest and specific. Choose a project example that genuinely reflects your abilities and contributions. - Quantify your successes. Numbers and percentages offer a clear picture of the impact you made. - Reflect on lessons learned. This can impress interviewers as it shows your capacity for growth and self-reflection. By utilizing the STAR method and following these tips, you can construct a compelling and structured answer that effectively communicates your experience and value to potential employers."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in colonial America of a Highlander Grenadier in the Continental Army washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

Not just any pond, mind you, but one that was about to bear witness to an event that would go unrecorded in the annals of history, yet would be worthy of folklore had the fishes been able to speak—and survive. Amidst this idyllic setting, a Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army, by the name of Angus MacBubble, decided it was high time for a bath. Angus was a sight to behold: his thick, fiery red hair cascaded down his broad shoulders like lava flowing down a mountain, albeit with a somewhat more graceful descent. His physique was that of a man who wielded muskets like twigs and charged into battle with the ferocity of a Highland storm. And his butt, oh, that was a masterpiece sculpted by the rigorous drills and endless marches; it was as if two perfectly rounded boulders had decided to settle down and make their home beneath his kilt. On this particular day, Angus waded into the pond, casting aside his garments with the nonchalance of a man at one with nature. As he dipped waist-deep into the cool embrace of the water, he began the sacred ritual of scrubbing the grime of war from his well-earned muscles. The serene environment, coupled with the soothing effect of the water, inspired a moment of relaxation in Angus. Feeling a bubbling sensation in his stomach, he grinned, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. \\"Ah, be ready, ye water spirits,\\" he chuckled to himself, placing his hands on his firm hips and pushing out his chest with pride. \\"Angus MacBubble is about to grant thee the honor of hosting the Highland Air Symphony!\\" With that, he leaned slightly to one side, squinting his eyes and pursing his lips in concentration. A moment of silence ensued, and then, with the effort of a man squeezing the last drop of water from a stone, he released a fart into the pond. The water around him rippled and bubbled as if a tiny underwater volcano had just erupted. Angus stood there, a proud, almost regal figure, as he inhaled deeply, savoring the aroma of his own creation. \\"Aye, now that’s the scent of the Highlands,\\" he proclaimed with a satisfied grin, ignoring the fact that the Highlands smelled nothing like the noxious gas he'd just released. As the ripples faded, a curious sight caught his eye: a few dead fish floated to the surface, their lifeless eyes staring up as if in shock at the lethal weapon they had just encountered. Angus scratched his head, pondering the sight before him. \\"Well, now, didn’t expect to be catchin' dinner with me arse,\\" he mused, his Scottish brogue thick with amusement. \\"But a warrior takes his meals where he can.\\" As he plucked the deceased fish from the water, examining them as though they were treasures bestowed upon him by the pond itself, he continued to speak, \\"Ach, don’t ye worry, my aquatic friends. Ye have not died in vain. Tonight, ye shall feast in the great halls of Valhalla, or whatever bonny place fish go when they meet their maker, courtesy of Angus MacBubble’s mighty wind.\\" Gathering the fish, Angus prepared to leave the pond, refreshed and now laden with an unexpected bounty. \\"This tale,\\" he said to himself as he dried off and began to dress, \\"will be one for the ages. 'The day Angus MacBubble fished with naught but his arse'—aye, that’ll light up the faces around the campfire.\\" And so, our Highlander Grenadier, clothed once more and with dinner in hand, strode back to camp, leaving behind a slightly less pure pond, but a story that, unfortunately for the fish, would never be fully appreciated by their kind."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in colonial America of a Highlander Grenadier in the Continental Army washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

The protagonist of our tale: Angus McFartnblast, a towering Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army, known across the colonies not just for his prowess on the battlefield but for his, let’s say, uniquely potent bodily emanations. Angus, with his mane of fiery red hair cascading down his broad, freckled back, wades waist-deep into the cool, serene waters. His physique, a spectacle of raw, muscular power sculpted through years of war and hardship, moves with an almost majestic grace. A stark contrast to the peaceful morning vista. Despite his formidability, it’s his posterior that truly stands out—a pair of cheeks as proud and formidable as the highlands from whence he came. This particular morning, Angus sought the tranquility of the pond not for reflection or meditation, but for a bath, one that was long overdue. Stripping down to his birthday suit, he confidently strides into the water, the coolness of the dawn doing little to chill his warm, hearty Scottish spirit. As he begins to scrub and cleanse himself, with makeshift soap fashioned from the land, a mischievous grin crosses his face. The serene silence is suddenly pierced by Angus attempting to muster what can only be described as a symphonic expulsion of gas. He squats slightly, his face turning a shade of crimson that rivals his hair, exerting himself with such enthusiasm that even the nearby flora seemed to lean in with anticipation. Finally, with a triumphant and resounding gurgle, the deed is done. A bubble train of considerable length and girth makes its way to the pond’s surface, breaking the stillness with a series of jubilant pops. “Ah, ain’t that a beauty!” Angus declares with a hearty, self-congratulatory laugh, inhaling deeply and savoring the aroma with an almost connoisseur-like appreciation. “Smells like the highlands after a heavy rain, it does!” But then, a ghastly consequence unfolds. To Angus’s disbelief, several fish float to the surface, victims of the toxic cloud he had just released. The sight would be comical if it weren’t so absurd. Eyes wide, Angus can’t help but reflect on his deadly potency. “Och, Laddie, didn’t mean to start a wee massacre,” he chuckles to himself, feeling a twinge of guilt for the unintended carnage. After a moment of contemplation, an idea dawns on him. “Waste not, want not, as me Ma’ used to say,” Angus muses, pondering the practicality of the situation. With skilled hands, he gathers the unfortunate fish, deciding that they would make a fine dinner. “A feast courtesy of me arse, who’d have thought?” Returning to shore, Angus dresses, slipping into his Grenadier garb with a sense of purpose and satisfaction. The silhouette of the sun now rising higher, casting a golden glow that illuminates the pond and the scene of this peculiar feast-to-be. “A tale for the ages, this’ll be,” Angus chuckles, imagining the look on his comrades' faces when he recounts the story of how he felled fish with nothing but the might of his bowels. “Angus McFartnblast, the only Scotsman to conquer with both sword and scent!” Thus, with his spoils in hand and a tale that would indeed echo through the annals of colonial humor, Angus set off, leaving behind a pond forever changed and a story that would be recounted around campfires and taverns alike, in whispered tones of disbelief and riotous laughter."},{"instruction":"#!/usr/bin/env -S swipl %-- mode: prolog;

Although most of the functions are correctly implemented and tested, the \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` function is marked as 'TODO', indicating it hasn't been implemented yet. To complete the implementation for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`, let’s break down the requirements and constraints: 1. The function should convert an expression involving integers, '+', and '*' into a list of tokens in prefix notation. 2. The implementation must use only earlier procedures, explicitly disallowing direct recursion or Prolog built-ins that might simplify this task directly. Given these constraints, a direct implementation within these bounds might not be straightforward since this function seems to require analyzing potentially deeply nested structures (like \`+(1, +(2, 3))\`) and converting them into a corresponding list in prefix notation (\`[+, 1, +, 2, 3]\`). However, I’ll sketch a theoretical approach based on the constraints and your existing infrastructure: 1. **Leverage Previous Implementations**: The \`named_to_op_expr/2\` and \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` predicates already do a significant amount of work that resembles what \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` needs. 2. **Transformation Approach**: - Convert the input op expression to a named expression format that \`named_to_op_expr/2\` can understand. For example, transforming \`+(1, 2)\` to \`add(1, 2)\`. - Use \`named_to_op_expr/2\` to convert the new named expression to an operation expression if needed or pass directly to \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. - \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` already generates a prefix notation, but tuned for your \`'add'\` and \`'mul'\` tags instead of the operational symbols \`'+'\` and \`'*'\`. **Important Note:** Directly implementing a conversion that just wraps or mimics the built-in parse and token generation for arithmetic expressions without using recursion or built-ins contradictorily challenges the problem statement. A true solution would likely require either a relaxation of the \\"no recursion\\" constraint to manually parse and convert the expression tree or a clever workaround that technically adheres to the rules while effectively bending them (e.g., exploiting Prolog's pattern-matching capabilities in a recursive manner that mimics iteration). Because of these constraints and without additional specific tools or previously established \\"helper\\" predicates tailored for direct expression parsing within these constraints, crafting a full, functional \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` under these conditions is a complex task. It's a conceptual challenge aimed at testing the limits of what's achievable with Prolog's pattern matching and recursion capabilities within a tightly constrained framework. For actual usage, one might consider relaxing the constraints to directly implement the needed logic or reevaluating the necessity of such constraints against the task requirements."},{"instruction":"Переведи Omnifactory на русской.

His mass of fiery red hair, often likened to the blaze of a cannon, cascaded down his broad, granite-like shoulders, the untamed locks betraying his ferocity in battle and a certain indomitable wildness. Famed not just for his might but also his uncanny ability to lighten the direst moods, Angus's most remarkable features, perhaps, were his brawny physique and particularly noticeable posterior, which rivalled the size and roundness of the cannonballs he often lobbed at the enemy. Both were subjects of much amusement and admiration among his fellow soldiers. One sweltering afternoon, seeking respite from the relentless heat and the grime of countless battles, Angus decided to wash himself in a nearby pond. Stripping down to his bare essentials, or rather, shedding all of them completely, he waded waist-deep into the murky waters. With the sun glinting off his pale Scottish hide, he was a sight to behold - a behemoth of muscle and fiery locks, standing amidst the tranquil waters, scrubbing the vestiges of war from his skin with a vigor that could only be described as Herculean. \\"I'll be needin' a wee bit more than water tae cleanse myself of that last skirmish,\\" Angus mumbled to himself, using a roughly fashioned soap as he scrubbed. Glancing down at the water's surface, which rippled with his every move, a mischievous glint lit up his eyes. \\"But perhaps, I've got just the thing to lighten the air, aye?\\" With a cheeky grin, Angus braced himself, tightening his muscles in preparation. He leaned slightly forward, the effort causing his titan-like form to tense. A look of concentrated glee danced across his face. Then, with a force rivaling a cannonade, he released a fart into the pond, the sound echoing off the trees like a salute to his own comedic genius. \\"Ah, that's the ticket!\\" Angus chuckled heartily, the satisfaction clear on his face as he took a moment to savor the peculiar aroma that soon enveloped him. \\"Nothing like the sweet scent of freedom, eh?\\" No sooner had the laughter subsided than a few ill-fated fish, victims of what one could only describe as an aquatic assault, floated to the surface, their demise seemingly brought on by the pungent stench. \\"Och, what have we here?\\" Angus exclaimed, eyeing the unfortunate creatures. \\"Dinner served up by the hand of fate itself!\\" He pondered for a moment, considering whether to take them for his supper. \\"Well, I've always fancied meself a bit of a fisherman, but I've never fished quite like this before. Will make fer a fine story, if not a fine meal. Waste not, want not, as they say!\\" Chuckling at his own resourcefulness, Angus scooped up the fish, his laughter echoing through the surrounding woods, a testament to the lighter side of life, even in times of war. \\"Ye maynae have needed to bite a hook, my fine friends, but ye've certainly bit off more than ye could chew with Angus MacPherson!\\" he declared triumphantly, making his way back to camp, his catch in hand and a mirthful sparkle in his eye, ready to regale his comrades with the tale of how he bested nature itself with nothing but his wits and his backside."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in colonial America of a Highlander Grenadier in the Continental Army washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

In such a setting, we find our protagonist, Angus McFartnagle, a Highlander Grenadier of formidable reputation in the Continental Army. He wasn't known for his subtlety. Nay, it was his sheer presence that caught the eye: a mop of unruly red hair that danced like fire in the wind, a physique carved from the mighty Scottish Highlands themselves—muscles layered upon muscles like the rugged terrain of his homeland. And his butt, oh, it was as if two robust melons had been smuggly housed within his trousers, causing quite the stir whenever he marched. On this peculiar day, Angus decided a bath was in order, having fought both the British and a rather regrettable stench emanating from his person. \\"Aye, time to wash away the sins o' battle... and the smells,\\" he muttered to himself, stepping into a secluded pond in nothing but his birthday suit. The water greeted him with a refreshing embrace, a stark contrast to the bloody melee of war. Floating waist-deep, he sighed, relishing the serenity of nature uninterrupted—save for his own presence, of course. Now, Angus had a special talent. Not only could he wield a bayonet with terrifying precision, but he could also produce flatulence with such force it could rival the sound of cannon fire. Feeling a particular pressure building within, he grinned, \\"Let's give these colonial waters a taste of the Highlands.\\" With effort that could be described as nothing short of Herculean, Angus hunched slightly, face turning a shade of crimson that matched his hair, and released a fart into the pond with such gusto it created bubbles that cascaded around him like a fizzy aura. \\"Ah, the sweet scent of freedom!\\" he exclaimed, inhaling deeply with an almost reverent expression. The water around him seemed to shimmer, or perhaps it quivered in fear, as a few moments passed in silent homage to his deed. Then, an unexpected audience made itself known. Several fish, unfortunate enough to have been in the direct path of Angus's natural weapon, floated to the surface, clearly overcome by the potent stench. \\"Well, what do we have here?\\" Angus remarked, observing the fish with a curious eye. \\"Looks like the feast has presented itself, courtesy of me own backside!\\" He contemplated the situation, tapping a finger against his robust chin. \\"To dine, or not to dine—that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous stomach, or to take arms against a sea of fishes...\\" His voice trailed off, then he shrugged and scooped up the fish. \\"Eh, waste not, want not. The lads will be singing tales of this feast for years to come. The day Angus McFartnagle not only cleared the battlefield but also provided dinner with naught but the power of his arse.\\" With that, our Highlander hero waded out of the pond, not bothering to clothe his wet, glistening form just yet. He walked back to camp, fish in hand, ready to regale his comrades with the tale of his piscatorial conquest courtesy of a well-timed fart. And indeed, the legend of Angus McFartnagle—the man who could fell both man and fish with the sheer force of his wind—grew ever larger, echoing through the annals of Continental Army lore."},{"instruction":"ما هو العلاج السلوك المعرفي","output":"العلاج السلوكي المعرفي (CBT) هو نوع من العلاج النفسي الذي يُستخدم لعلاج مجموعة واسعة من الاضطرابات النفسية، بما في ذلك الاكتئاب، القلق، الرهاب، اضطراب ما بعد الصدمة، اضطرابات الأكل، ومشكلات النوم مثل الأرق. يركز هذا النوع من العلاج على تغيير الأفكار والمعتقدات السلبية أو غير الواقعية التي تؤثر على الشخص وتحويلها إلى أفكار أكثر إيجابية وواقعية، مما يساعد على تحسين الحالة المزاجية والسلوك. العلاج السلوكي المعرفي يقوم على فكرة أساسية مفادها أن أفكارنا (المعرفة) ومشاعرنا وسلوكياتنا مرتبطة ببعضها البعض وأنه يمكن تغيير الشعور بالتحسن من خلال تغيير طريقة تفكيرنا وتصرفنا. يشمل العلاج استراتيجيات مثل: 1. **تحديد الأفكار السلبية**: يُعلم المعالج الشخص كيفية التعرف على أفكاره ومعتقداته السلبية. 2. **تحدي التفكير السلبي**: يُشجع الشخص على التحدي والتساؤل حول صحة هذه الأفكار واستبدالها بأخرى أكثر واقعية وإيجابية. 3. **تغيير السلوك**: يُساعد العلاج الشخص على تغيير السلوكيات التي قد تؤدي إلى تحسين مزاجه وحالته العامة. 4. **مهارات التأقلم**: يُعلم الشخص مهارات جديدة للتعامل مع التوتر والضغط النفسي. 5. **التعرض والوقاية من الاستجابة**: خاصة في حالة الرهاب والقلق الشديد، حيث يتم تعريض الشخص بشكل تدريجي وآمن للموقف أو الشيء الذي يخاف منه. عادةً ما يكون العلاج السلوكي المعرفي قصير الأمد وأكثر تركيزاً من أشكال العلاج النفسي الأخرى. يتم تصميمه لتزويد الأفراد بالأدوات والاستراتيجيات اللازمة لتغيير تفكيرهم وسلوكهم بطريقة تُسهم في تحسين نوعية حياتهم."},{"instruction":"هل يوجد نقاط تحفيزية للتركيز في المخ","output":"في الحقيقة، مفهوم \\"نقاط تحفيزية للتركيز\\" في المخ قد يُوحي بوجود مناطق محددة يمكن استهدافها مباشرة لتحسين التركيز دون سواها. بينما لا يوجد \\"زر تركيز\\" محدد في المخ يمكن الضغط عليه، هناك عدة استراتيجيات وتمارين التي يمكن أن تساعد في تعزيز القدرة على التركيز والانتباه من خلال تحفيز أو تفعيل مناطق معيّنة في الدماغ. بعض من هذه الاستراتيجيات تشمل: 1. **ممارسة الرياضة**: النشاط البدني ينشط الدماغ ويحسن وظائفه الإدراكية، بما في ذلك التركيز. 2. **تقنيات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية (Mindfulness)**: التأمل يساعد في تحسين التركيز ويقلل من التشتت، كما يمكن أن يعزز من قدرة الدماغ على معالجة المعلومات. 3. **نظام غذائي متوازن**: تناول أطعمة تحتوي على أحماض أوميغا-3 الدهنية، الفيتامينات، والمعادن يمكن أن يسهم في تحسين وظائف الدماغ. 4. **تنظيم النوم**: الحصول على قسط كافٍ من النوم ليلاً يساعد في تحسين القدرة على التركيز والاحتفاظ بالمعلومات. 5. **تقليل التوتر**: التوتر المفرط يمكن أن يؤثر سلبًا على التركيز، لذا يفيد التحكم بمستويات التوتر. 6. **تمارين الدماغ**: ألغاز الكلمات، الألغاز، السودوكو، وغيرها من ألعاب التفكير يمكن أن تساعد في تقوية قدرات الدماغ. من الناحية العلمية، يمكن القول إن التركيز يعتمد على عمل متكامل بين مناطق مختلفة من الدماغ، بما في ذلك القشرة الجبهية (التي تلعب دوراً في التحكم والانتباه) والحُصين (المهم لتشكيل الذاكرة). عند ممارسة الأنشطة أو التمارين التي تحسن الصحة العقلية والجسدية، يمكن تعزيز تركيز الدماغ وقدراته الإدراكية بشكل عام."},{"instruction":"ما هى تقنيات التامل واليقظة الذهنية","output":"تقنيات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية هي مجموعة من الممارسات التي تهدف إلى تحسين الوعي باللحظة الحالية، تقليل التوتر، وتعزيز الصحة العقلية والرفاهية العامة. هذه التقنيات تساعد الأشخاص على التركيز على الحاضر، بدلاً من القلق بشأن الماضي أو المستقبل. إليك بعض من أشهر تقنيات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية: 1. **تأمل التركيز**: -

Nettuno, il gigante del ghiaccio più lontano, con venti impetuosi che raggiungono i 2.500 km/h e un'atmosfera simile a quella di Urano, ma con tracce di azoto e metano, orbita a 4,5 miliardi di chilometri dal Sole. (Bridge) Asteroidi e comete, corpi minori del Sistema Solare, resti della sua formazione primordiale, contengono tracce della sua origine e dei suoi componenti primordiali, e sono testimoni di eventi catastrofici che hanno modellato la struttura e l'evoluzione dei pianeti nel corso di miliardi di anni. Missioni spaziali robotiche, sonde e telescopi potenti, come il James Webb Space Telescope, ci permettono di esplorare il Sistema Solare con una risoluzione senza precedenti, svelando i suoi segreti e spingendo i confini della nostra conoscenza. (Chorus) Un viaggio affascinante tra pianeti, lune e asteroidi, un'avventura scientifica alla scoperta dei misteri del Sistema Solare, un'opera d'arte cosmica in continua evoluzione, un cosmo di tesori infiniti da scoprire e comprendere. Continuiamo ad esplorarlo con passione e curiosità, per svelare i segreti dell'universo e la sua immensità, spingendo i confini della conoscenza umana e ampliando la nostra comprensione del posto che occupiamo in questo vasto e affascinante cosmo. (Outro) Scienza e musica unite in un connubio speciale, per comprendere la bellezza e la complessità del cosmo che ci circonda. Il Sistema Solare, un'avventura da vivere, un'opera d'arte cosmica da scoprire e capire, un viaggio emozionante nella vastità dell'universo che ci spinge a sognare e ad andare oltre i limiti dell'immaginabile.","output":"(Verse 1) Otto sfere danzano in spazi profondi, in una danza gravitazionale non è secondi, Attorno al sole, si muovono ardenti, illuminando i mondi, sogni viventi. Mercurio, piccolo e bruciato, vicino al sol sta orbitato. Privato d'aria, da vulcani segnato, nel caldo intenso è abbandonato. Venere, nell'inferno s’è celato, con atmosfera toxica è avvolto e serrato. Sotto una calura mai appagato, da un effetto serra, è completamente soffocato. Terra, oasi d'acqua e vita, sotto il sole splendida e infinita. Foreste e mari, la sua faccia è fiorita, in essa la vita si è ritrovita. Marte, il deserto rosso sotto il ciel, con calotte di ghiaccio, nasconde un segretel. Tracce d'acqua, di vita un model, a 227,9 milioni da nostra stella, il pennel. (Chorus) Giove, gigante, con tempeste senza età, La Grande Macchia Rossa, un mistero che va. Fisica mostra in tutta la sua maestà, tra le orbite stende la sua imponenza e beltà. Saturno, con anelli di ghiaccio incantati, vanta lune, come Titano, tra i suoi affidati. Con metano e azoto è adornato, in un ballo cosmico, sempre ammirato. Urano, ghiacciato e inclinato, in un'atmosfera di gas è cullato. Con un campo magnetico appena svelato, tra miliardi di chilometri, è navigato.

However, when integrating multiprocessing into a GUI application, especially one built with Kivy and involving networking (like your use case), it's crucial to manage the inter-process communication properly and ensure that the main event loop of the GUI remains responsive. Given your existing implementation, there are a few considerations and changes you might need to implement to incorporate multiprocessing, specifically for the \`listen_server\` functionality: 1. **Thread vs. Process**: Your current implementation uses \`threading.Thread\` for the \`_listen_server\` method. Threads run in the same memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces. For CPU-bound operations or when trying to leverage multiple CPU cores, multiprocessing can be more effective. However, for I/O bound operations, such as network communication or waiting for data, threading or asynchronous programming might be more suitable. 2. **Communicating Between Processes**: If you switch to multiprocessing, consider how you'd communicate between the main GUI process and the listening process. The \`multiprocessing\` module offers \`Queue\` and \`Pipe\` for inter-process communication. 3. **Integrating with Kivy's Event Loop**: Kivy runs an event loop that handles UI updates, and mixing it with asyncio or multiprocessing requires careful orchestration to ensure the UI remains responsive. You already use \`Clock.schedule_once\` to call back into the Kivy main loop from a thread, which is good practice. For multiprocessing, you'd similarly need a mechanism to safely communicate from your listening process back to the Kivy main thread. Here is a revised approach keeping the above considerations in mind. Given your specific case deals with network I/O and might not strictly benefit from multiprocessing over multithreading or asyncio for listening, I'll focus on guidelines rather than altering your code to multiprocessing: - **Evaluate the Need for Multiprocessing**: If your server listening task is I/O bound (waiting for network data), the existing threaded approach or using asyncio across the application might be sufficient and simpler to integrate with Kivy. - **Integrate Multiprocessing Carefully**: If you find a compelling reason to use multiprocessing (e.g., for CPU-intensive tasks alongside), ensure you understand how to communicate between processes and integrate these communications back into the Kivy event loop safely. - **AsyncIO Integration**: Your application is using \`asyncio\` for the Discord bot. Consider leveraging \`asyncio\` more extensively for I/O bound tasks, including the network listening part, while ensuring it's correctly integrated with Kivy’s event loop. This approach can offer a cohesive and efficient I/O concurrency model without introducing the complexities of multiprocessing. If you decide to proceed with multiprocessing for specific tasks, ensure to review Kivy's threading and multiprocessing guidelines to avoid issues with UI updates from non-main threads or processes. Remember, the key challenge in GUI applications with concurrency is maintaining responsive UIs and safely managing state updates from concurrent operations."},{"instruction":"can you do it fully working?","output":"Creating a fully working example that incorporates multiprocessing or threading into a Kivy application for continuous server listening, especially with Discord bot integration, requires careful consideration of Kivy's event loop and the async nature of Discord.py. Given the complexity and the need to ensure the UI remains responsive while handling network communications, I'll provide an example that keeps most of your structure intact but focuses on integrating threading effectively with Kivy, as this seems to be the most straightforward approach for your scenario. Let's refine your server listening part within the Kivy application to ensure it's well-integrated: # Step 1: Refining the Listening Function Your \`_listen_server\` function is designed to run in a thread. This is a good approach for network I/O tasks.

Please note, creating a fully working, complex application in a single iteration might require further adjustments based on your specific environment, Discord bot permissions, and server setup. Below is a simplified and more concise version of the application that still captures the essence of integrating Kivy with Discord.py and a listening server using threads. This example focuses on the foundational structure, leaving room for expansion and customization based on your needs. # Simplified Kivy Application with Discord Bot and Listening Server \`\`\`python import asyncio from threading import Thread import socket import discord from discord.ext import commands from kivy.app import App from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout from kivy.uix.button import Button class DiscordClient(commands.Bot): def __init__(self, command_prefix, intents): super().__init__(command_prefix=command_prefix, intents=intents) async def setup_hook(self): # Setup tasks if needed pass class MyApp(App): def build(self): self.discord_bot = DiscordClient(command_prefix=\\"!\\", intents=discord.Intents.default()) return MyWidget(self.discord_bot) class MyWidget(BoxLayout): def __init__(self, discord_bot, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) self.discord_bot = discord_bot self.orientation = 'vertical' start_bot_button = Button(text='Start Discord Bot') start_bot_button.bind(on_press=self.start_discord_bot) self.add_widget(start_bot_button) start_listen_button = Button(text='Start Listening Server') start_listen_button.bind(on_press=self.start_listening_server) self.add_widget(start_listen_button) def start_discord_bot(self, instance): bot_token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE' Thread(target=lambda: asyncio.run(self.discord_bot.start(bot_token)), daemon=True).start() def start_listening_server(self, instance): Thread(target=self.listen_server, daemon=True).start() def listen_server(self): server_address = ('localhost', 12345) with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock: sock.bind(server_address) sock.listen() print(\\"Listening for connections on\\", server_address) connection, client_address = sock.accept() with connection: print(\\"Connected by\\", client_address) while True: data = connection.recv(1024) if not data: break print(f\\"Received data: {data}\\") if __name__ == '__main__': MyApp().run() \`\`\` # Key Components and Changes 1. **Discord Bot**: The \`DiscordClient\` class is a subclass of \`commands.Bot\`, allowing for easy expansion and customization. It's initialized and managed within the Kivy App's lifecycle. 2. **Kivy UI**: The UI consists of a simple \`BoxLayout\` with buttons to start the Discord bot and the listening server. It’s designed for simplicity and can be extended based on UI requirements. 3. **Multi-threading**: Both the Discord bot and the listening server are started in their threads, ensuring the main UI thread remains unblocked and responsive. 4. **Listening Server**: A simple TCP server setup that listens for connections and prints received data. This serves as a placeholder for more complex server logic. # Important Notes - Replace \`'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'\` with your actual Discord bot token. - The listening server is set to listen on \`localhost\` (\`127.0.0.1\`) at port \`12345\`. Ensure this matches your client's connection settings. - This example opens a server socket and accepts a single connection for simplicity. Depending on your needs, you might want to handle multiple connections or utilize a higher-level networking library. - The threads are marked as \`daemon\` to ensure they terminate when the main application exits. This is crucial for avoiding lingering processes after the app is closed. - Consider adding proper error handling, especially for network operations, to ensure robustness.

When data is received, it is printed to the console and sent to the GUI via a custom event \`on_data_received\`. 3. **GUI Updates**: The GUI consists of a \`Label\` that updates with the latest data received by the server. This demonstrates how to thread-safely update the UI based on background operations. 4. **Custom Event Handling**: The \`on_data_received\` method in \`MyWidget\` is designed to handle custom events dispatched from the server listening thread, showcasing a simple but effective way to communicate between threads in a Kivy application. 5. **Daemon Threads**: Both the Discord bot and the server listener run in daemon threads, ensuring they automatically close when the main application exits. This example provides a solid foundation for an application that combines a Kivy-based UI, a background server for listening to incoming connections, and a Discord bot, all running concurrently through effective use of threading.

Suddenly they all peel off their faces, and reveal themselves to be women. The man freaks out, and tries to run, but they all catch him. They pin him down, and he feels a strong tingling sensation. He feels his skin dropping off, and gets up, looking into a mirror, seeing another woman.","output":"In the heart of a bustling city, on the twenty-third floor of a sleek, modern apartment building, Ethan had been invited to celebrate his friend Marcus’s thirty-second birthday. As the elevator hummed its ascent, Ethan felt a mix of excitement and anticipation. He had known Marcus and the usual gang for over a decade, having bonded over college assignments, late-night study sessions, and countless memories since. The elevator dinged on the twenty-third floor, its doors sliding open to a dimly lit hallway that led to Marcus’s apartment, adorned with muffled sounds of music and laughter. Ethan, carrying a small, neatly wrapped gift under his arm, made his way to the door and knocked. The door swung open, revealing a scene unlike any Ethan had anticipated for a birthday celebration. The apartment was dimly lit with eerie, blue lights, casting long shadows against the walls. The guests seemed almost too engrossed in their conversations, their backs turned to him, their movements oddly synchronized. Feeling a twinge of unease, Ethan entered, attempting to shake off the creeping sense of strangeness. “Hey, man, happy birthday!” Ethan greeted, finding Marcus amidst the odd assembly. Marcus turned, his smile wide yet seemingly forced, “Ethan! So glad you could make it. Join in, join in!” As Ethan moved deeper into the party, he couldn’t help but notice the peculiar demeanor of the guests. Their laughter seemed hollower, their movements too stiff, and their conversations, though lively, felt rehearsed. It was as if everyone was acting, playing their part in a play Ethan hadn’t rehearsed for. Looking for some semblance of normalcy, Ethan attempted to strike up conversations, but each interaction felt more bizarre than the last, leading him to retreat to a corner, observing the party with growing apprehension. That’s when the unthinkable happened. One by one, the guests began to peel off their faces, as if removing elaborate, intricately designed masks, revealing entirely different faces beneath—faces of women. Each one bore a serene expression, their eyes gleaming with an otherworldly gleam. The room filled with a collective sigh, a sound of liberation, of shedding a facade long worn. Ethan’s heart hammered against his ribcage, his mind racing to make sense of the impossible scene unfolding before him. As he turned towards the door, planning his escape, the guests—or rather, the women—closed in around him, their movements no longer stiff but eerily fluid. Marcus approached, her face now that of a woman’s, her expression one of somber understanding. “Ethan, there’s no need to run. You were chosen to be here, to embrace who you really are.” Panic surged through Ethan as they pinned him down effortlessly. A strong tingling sensation erupted across his skin, rippling through his body with an intensity that bordered on pain and ecstasy. He could feel his skin, his very identity, peeling away, layer by layer, as if shedding a cocoon he had been unaware of. Released from their hold, Ethan staggered to his feet, the room spinning around him. His eyes caught a glimpse of a mirror across the room, and with trepidation, he approached it. The reflection that greeted him was not his own but that of a woman, her features a mirror of his, yet undeniably different. His, or rather, her eyes widened in shock, a hand reaching up to touch the face that she now bore. The room fell into a respectful silence, giving her a moment to grapple with the revelation. Marcus stepped forward, her voice gentle, “Welcome, sister. You’ve been living under a disguise you never needed. Here, you are seen for who you truly are.” Ethan, now standing before the mirror as a woman, felt a swell of emotions. Fear, confusion, but amidst it all, an underlying sense of rightness, of coming home. The guests, her new sisters, gathered around, their expressions welcoming, devoid of the oddness that had so unsettled him before. As the night wore on, Ethan—still grappling with her new identity—listened to stories similar to hers, of longing, discovery, and acceptance. Each story served as a thread, weaving her into the fabric of this newfound sisterhood. The birthday celebration turned into a night of revelations and newfound bonds, a celebration of true selves discovered and embraced. Ethan, now embracing her identity as Eva, stepped into a new chapter of her life, surrounded by sisters who had guided her through her metamorphosis, into the truth of her being. The party, once a place of confusion and fear, had become a sanctuary of acceptance and understanding.

As the elevator ascended, Ethan's, or rather Eva's, heart raced, not just with the anticipation of the celebration but with the life-changing revelation she planned to share. Upon arriving, the apartment revealed a scene far from the typical birthday bash Ethan had expected. The dimly lit room, bathed in eerie, blue lights, and the guests, who seemed unusually engrossed in their conversations, presented an atmosphere of otherworldliness. Despite the unsettling vibe, Ethan pushed forward, greeting Marcus, the birthday person, and trying to blend in with the crowd. But as the party progressed, the odd behavior of the guests became increasingly apparent. Their laughter was too hollow; their movements were too synchronized.

Major cities around the world, London, Washington D.C., Tokyo, are all engulfed in a hellish blaze of atomic waste. 2042 - NATO decides to retaliate, launching nuclear missiles on major strategic and population centers of the enemy side as well. Almost halving the human population alive at the time. 2044 - To add insult to injury, a plague begins developing. with incurable effects and very resilient viruses, there is very little hope for humanity. 2050 - As of 1/1/2050, less than 1/3 of the original population of Earth at its peak in 2038 are still alive. (not counting those dead from natural causes). 2054 - Global resources being strained and very little population leads to the remaining factions and nations of Earth to call a temporary detente in order to get back together and hopefully keep mankind from becoming extinct. # [In their hopelessness, the spires rose.] 2055 - This period of hopelessness soons marks the beginning of a resurgence in religion, leading mankind to construct \\"doomspires\\", towering temples of multi-colored bricks to appease Blox.

This heralds the beginning of what many believe to be the final judgement. 2099, December 11 - A comet, unseen by scientists until it is nearly upon the Earth, grazes the atmosphere, igniting the sky in a display of celestial fury. This event coincides with the sounding of the second trumpet, causing mass hysteria and reinforcing the belief that the end times are nigh. # [The Seven Years of Trials] 2100-2107 - The period known as the Seven Years of Trials begins, marked by further celestial and terrestrial cataclysms. Unnatural disasters ravage the Earth: oceans turn blood-red, wildfires consume entire continents, and darkness envelops the world for months at a time. With each disaster, another trumpet sounds. # [The Rise of the Redeemers] 2103, June 6 - Amidst the chaos, a group of individuals asserting extraordinary abilities and claiming divine mission, known as the Redeemers, rises. They gather followers, promising salvation and protection from the ongoing calamities. Cities and communities divide between those who believe in their divinity and those who see them as opportunists exploiting the world's despair. # [The Fracture of Faith] 2105, November 23 - A revelation rocks the world's remaining faithful: a leaked document, allegedly from a divine source, suggests that the so-called \\"end times\\" are not a predestined apocalypse but a test of faith, orchestrated by a disillusioned deity doubting its creations' worthiness. This revelation fractures the populace further, between unwavering believers, agnostics, and those who now view their gods as fallible beings. # [God's Despair] 2108, August 19 - In a move that shocks both the mortal and the celestial realms, the deity once revered as the omnipotent creator broadcasts a message of despair. Tired, disillusioned, and mourning the irredeemable state of humanity, the deity announces its intention to retreat from the universe, questioning whether creation was a mistake. # [The Disappearance] 2109, April 1 - Without fanfare, without a cataclysmic event, the deity vanishes. Prayers go unanswered, and the signs of divine presence fade from the world. The Redeemers, now without the divine backing they once claimed, lose their influence as the world grapples with the absence of its creator. # [Aftermath and the Age of Reflection] 2110 - The Earth, now quiet, begins the slow process of healing. Humanity, leaderless and left to its own devices, enters an era of introspection. Cultures that once centered around divine worship now seek meaning in the bonds of community, in the resilience of the human spirit, and in the stewardship of the planet. As the world moves on, some hope the deity might one day return, having found faith in its creation once more. Others speculate that perhaps the deity's \\"suicide\\" was not an end but a transformation, a shedding of an old persona to be reborn amidst those it had created.

However, specific details like \\"GPT-4 Turbo: Research Preview (128K token limit, Short-Term Availability)\\" could refer to new developments or specific configurations OpenAI is testing or planning to release for research or limited usage. In general, OpenAI has been exploring ways to increase the efficiency, capability, and accessibility of their models. This involves enhancements that could allow models to process more information in a single prompt (like increasing the token limit), enhancing the model's understanding and generation capabilities, and making these advanced models available for researchers and developers to explore novel applications. **Regarding a 128K token limit**, traditionally, GPT-3 and its iterations have had much lower token limits for a single interaction. A significant increase, such as to 128K tokens, would represent a substantial enhancement in how much text the model can consider or generate in a single interaction, massively expanding its use cases in tasks requiring deep, context-rich operations, like analyzing long-form documents in a single go or creating extensive content in one prompt. **Short-term availability** might refer to OpenAI providing access to these enhanced capabilities on a limited basis, possibly to gather user feedback, conduct research, or manage resource constraints. This can help them fine-tune the system before a broader release. Remember, the details about future models like GPT-4, its variants, or specific features like \\"Turbo\\" modes, are speculative until confirmed by direct announcements from OpenAI. For the very latest information, including on offerings like GPT-4 Turbo, if that's on the horizon, I recommend checking OpenAI's official updates and blog posts."},{"instruction":"Describe Yuntian Deng's ChatGPT (also you), access without OpenAI","output":"As of my last update, any specific version of ChatGPT attributed to an individual, such as a \\"Yuntian Deng's ChatGPT,\\" likely refers to a customized or specialized application or usage of OpenAI's technology, possibly tailored by or for Yuntian Deng. It's important to clarify that while individuals and organizations can use OpenAI's API to create various applications with personalized features or datasets, each of these projects operates under the terms and access set by OpenAI. If you're referring to accessing a model like \\"Yuntian Deng's ChatGPT\\" without going through OpenAI's official channels or API, the details would highly depend on how the model is hosted and shared. Typically, there are a few key points to consider: 1. **API Access**: Accessing any version of GPT (including specialized versions) for most users involves interacting with the model through OpenAI's API, which requires an API key. This is how OpenAI controls and monitors the use of their technology to ensure it's used ethically and within their guidelines. 2. **Custom Implementations**: If Yuntian Deng or anyone else has developed a customized version of ChatGPT or a unique interface for interacting with OpenAI's models, the accessibility of that tool to the public would be governed by the creator. They might host it on a web platform, provide access through a specific interface, or even integrate it within a larger application. The availability and access method would vary significantly based on the creator's intent and the technical setup. 3. **Terms and Conditions**: Using OpenAI's technology, including customized versions thereof, would still be subject to OpenAI's terms of use, guidelines, and API usage policies. Even if a custom interface or application is created, the underlying use of the AI models should comply with OpenAI's rules, including attribution and permissible use cases. 4. **Direct Hosting and Sharing**: In scenarios where a developer or researcher wants to share their custom model or application based on GPT with others without going through OpenAI's API, they would need to ensure they're not violating OpenAI's intellectual property rights or their API's terms of service. This could involve sharing code that interfaces with the OpenAI API (where users would still need their own API keys) or offering a standalone application that does not dynamically use OpenAI's models but was trained or informed by them under permissible conditions. Without more specific details, it's challenging to provide a precise answer on how to access \\"Yuntian Deng's ChatGPT\\" or any analogous project without standard OpenAI channels. It's also essential to respect intellectual property rights, terms of service, and ethical guidelines when interacting with AI technologies and their custom implementations."},{"instruction":"summarize this, keep it intresting: Models Accuracy A.

First off, the arena of Naive Bayes from scratch. Picture three contenders, each tweaking the recipe of preprocessing texts - from the meticulous weeding out of new lines, minuscule characters, and stop words, to the strategic play of lowercasing and special character omission. Tokenization and lemmatization tools, spacy and stanza, are switched up, hoping for a linguistic edge. Despite their valiant efforts, their accuracies flutter like leaves in the wind, with model performances ranging modestly, hovering around 50%, while the F1-Score dances around 3.5%, more or less a whisper in the storm. Next, enter the Scikit-learn Naive bayes gladiators, armed with pre-trained prowess. These models, wielding the sharp blades of Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer, step into the fray. The Count Vectorizer model slashes through with an impressive 68.59% mean average and an F1-Score of 13.37%, while the TF-IDF counterpart, though sturdy, trails with a 54.1% mean average and a 4.08% F1-Score. A tale of two strategies, where the raw count of words seems to have outmaneuvered the finesse of term frequency-inverse document frequency. Lastly, the titans of Word Embedding Models manifest, leveraging the colossal power of pre-trained embeddings: Glove, Word2Vec, and FastText, each with a vocabulary arsenal stretching from 400K to 3M words. When the dust settles, it's the Glove wielding its magic twice, tweaking maximum iterations and regularization, that steals the spotlight. Results soar up to a remarkable 72.79% mean average, with the F1-Score reaching a peak of 37.54% in its most balanced incarnation. It's a demonstration of how adjusting the knobs of iteration and regulation can fine-tune performance to nearly symphonic levels. In an interesting twist, changing the solver – the algorithmic heartbeat of logistic regression – barely nudges the needle of accuracy and F1 scores, suggesting that sometimes, the choice of weapon might not be as critical as the strategy and understanding of the battlefield. This exploration into the battleground of text classification uncovers the nuanced power struggles between models, preprocessing choices, and the relentless quest for balance and supremacy in the numeric representation of words. It’s a riveting narrative of trial, error, and triumph in the face of linguistic complexity."},{"instruction":"shorten it","output":"Diving into the world of text classification, we explore a diverse array of models battling the complexities of language with numbers.

Correction for \`same_length_sublists/1\` In your \`all_same_length/1\` predicate, the duplicated base case is not only redundant, as previously mentioned, but also incorrect. The second base case should ensure handling of a single list correctly, e.g., by indicating that a list with a single sublist complies without needing to compare lengths. The core logic for \`all_same_length/1\` seems correct but let's clarify and correct it: \`\`\`prolog all_same_length([]). all_same_length([_]). % Correct handling for a single list all_same_length([X, Y | T]) :- length(X, L), length(Y, L), all_same_length([Y | T]). \`\`\` Ensure this correction replaces your current implementation of \`all_same_length/1\` in the \`same_length_sublists/1\` section, removing the incorrect duplicate base case. # 2. Correction for \`fibonacci_sublists/1\` The problem with \`fibonacci_sublists/1\` arises from the unnecessary duplicate of the base case and misunderstanding of how Fibonacci sequences should start. You correctly handled lists up to a length of two directly. However, by providing two base cases (\`fibonacci_sublists([]).\`), one of them becomes unreachable and redundant. A corrected approach should look like this: \`\`\`prolog fibonacci_sublists([]). fibonacci_sublists([_]). fibonacci_sublists([_, _]). fibonacci_sublists([A, B, C|T]) :- length(A, AL), length(B, BL), length(C, CL), CL is AL + BL, fibonacci_sublists([B, C|T]). \`\`\` This revised approach removes the duplicated base case ensuring that your predicate can correctly handle Fibonacci sublist length sequences. # General Note After implementing these corrections, re-run your tests. These changes should address the failed test cases for \`all_same_length([])\` occurring in \`same_length_sublists/1\` tests, and the \`fibonacci_sublists/1\` predicate's incorrect handling of the singleton list scenario. # Additional Recommendations - As your script evolves, consider systematically reviewing the logical flow and edge cases like empty lists, single-element lists, or sublists to ensure your predicates robustly handle a variety of inputs. - Regularly rerun your tests after making adjustments, as this practice can help catch new issues early and assist in maintaining the correct functionality of previously working predicates.

[AKS-Three immediately zooms in on Scooby.] **AKS-Three:** Noise violation detected. Please mute your dog or face ejection. [Just then, a sock mysteriously lands in Shaggy's pocket. AKS-Three grabs Artie, a grumpy-looking employee dressed as a robot for a promotional event, mistaking him for a thief.] **Artie (annoyed):** This is the third time today, AKS-Three! I work here! [They meet Mrs. Howard, the store's overly critical manager, scolding Artie.] **Mrs. Howard:** Artie, if you can't even play a convincing robot without causing a scene, maybe we should find a role more suitable for you—like being a doorstop! [Artie, visibly fuming as Mrs. Howard walks away, doesn't notice the gang eavesdropping.] **Scrappy:** Wow, she really knows how to wind up her employees! **Shaggy:** Like, he looked about ready to short-circuit! [Suddenly, the lights flicker, and merchandise starts disappearing all over the store. AKS-Three is accused since it's a robot—he must have a programming glitch, they say.] **Artie (as the robot, unconvincingly trying to act innocent):** It wasn't me, I was... recharging in the broom closet! **Shaggy:** Like, seems legit, Scoob. **Scooby:** Ryeah, rogit! [The trio decides to investigate, with Scrappy leading with indefatigable enthusiasm.] **Scrappy:** Time to unmask this mechanical maniac, and I know just the pup for the job! [They engage in classic Scooby-Doo chase sequences with AKS-Three—including running through an endless series of doors in the maintenance corridor, and disguising themselves as mannequins, only for Shaggy to blow their cover when he sneezes.] [Finally, after a convoluted plan that involves Scooby and Shaggy pretending to be toy drones flying with balloons, while Scrappy accidentally turns on every gadget in the electronics department, they corner Artie dressed as AKS-Three near the air conditioning units.] **Scrappy:** Alright, mister! This pup's not afraid of some tin can! [Artie, trying to run but slipping on a trail of marbles left by Scooby, is caught. When they unmask him, they find his face painted silver.] **Artie:** I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids and that... puppy! **Shaggy:** Like, man, who knew robots were allergic to marbles? [Scooby does his classic giggle.] **Scooby:** Rehehehehe, Rooby-Rooby-Roo! [The episode ends with them leaving the department store, their shopping complete but the Mystery Machine now towing several parking tickets.] **Scrappy:** Another mystery solved by Puppy Power! **Shaggy:** And like, a birthday to remember! **Scooby:** Remember the rickets, Shaggy? **Shaggy (nervously laughing):** Like, how could I forget? Maybe we can solve a mystery at the DMV next time? [All laugh as they drive off into the sunset, leaving a trail of parking tickets fluttering in the wind.] --- **[End of Episode: \\"The Robotic Ruckus\\"]**"},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

The Magic Palace, where calories appear out of thin air! **Scooby:** Rehehe, ralories!

They slip backstage, adopting 'sleuth mode.' They spy The Great Disappearo removing his mask and having a conversation with a shady figure.] **The Great Disappearo:** Well, it's gone. Vanished. Like my hopes of a peaceful retirement. **Shady Figure:** Good. Remember, we split the proceeds 50-50. **Shaggy:** Like, how can he split a necklace in half? **Scooby:** Ragic! [The trio decides to set a trap, using Scrappy as bait, believing he has a diamond necklace.] **Scrappy:** Come and get it, Mr. Great Disappearo! I'm a helpless pup with a valuable necklace!

Don't forget the adventure! [They board the boat to be greeted by the captain, a man whose beard looks suspiciously like a mop head.] **Captain:** Welcome aboard the S.S. Shenanigan! Mind your step.

Основная причина этой цензуры заключается в статье 175 Уголовного кодекса Японии, которая запрещает распространение порнографических материалов с изображением гениталий без цензуры. В результате производители хентай используют различные методы для скрытия или замыливания таких деталей, включая наложение баров, световых эффектов и других визуальных приемов. Однако за пределами Японии требования к цензуре могут отличаться, и некоторые издания могут быть доступны без цензурных ограничений, особенно в странах с другим законодательством в области порнографии.

The error messages indicate that this predicate (\`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\`) is being called but has not been defined in your script. Given the error context and the goal to convert operations to prefix tokens based on earlier procedures, it appears the intent is to transform expressions given in operator form (e.g., \`+(1, 2)\`) into a format that could be seen as an in-house representation (i.e., using \`add\`, \`mul\`), and then to utilize existing conversion routines to generate prefix notation for these expressions. There is no specific implementation for \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` as required. However, this predicate seems to be intended to convert standard Prolog arithmetic expressions into named expressions (\`add(X,Y)\`, \`mul(X,Y)\`) used in other predicates in your module. A simple correction would involve either removing the call to an unimplemented/incorrect predicate or implementing the missing predicate correctly. However, since your challenge involves using only existing predicates, you should directly convert expressions to prefix tokens without declaring or utilizing \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\`. But based on the context provided, here's an approach for directly realizing \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` without an intermediate conversion through an unimplemented function like \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\`. This updated version optimizes your flow by assuming you want to directly tokenize expressions: Assuming the task requires direct processing of Prolog expressions to prefix notation tokens using the defined predicates, a simple fix is that instead of transforming through an intermediate custom representation, you directly parse \`Expr\` into a token list in \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`. However, without modifying the underlying logic significantly and without a direct implementation, a specific fix for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is challenging to suggest. The core idea would involve parsing the \`Expr\` for \`add\`, \`mul\`, and integers directly to tokens, which seems to misinterpret the referenced \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` function's purpose. If you still need to correct or implement missing functionality, you would ideally provide the logic for converting operator expressions (like \`+(1,2)\`) directly to their prefix forms and then use already defined predicates for handling names (\`add\`, \`mul\`) and evaluation. For the sake of guidance, if \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` was meant to play a part, it would ideally convert expressions from named to operator-based or vice versa. But, your \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` seems to inverse the logic by referring to a non-existent conversion before tokenizing—which isn't possible unless you redefine your approach. If you have any specific functionality in mind for \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` or need further direction on how to handle \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`, please provide more details or clarify how you envision the conversion process working with the rest of your predicates."},{"instruction":"Paciente do sexo masculino, 50 anos, diabético tipo 2, ensino fundamental completo, gerente de comércio de loja de varejo.

Utilizando as porcentagens estipuladas para macronutrientes, temos: - **Carboidratos: 55%** de 1700 kcal = 935 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 233,75g. - **Proteínas: 15,9%** de 1700 kcal = 270,4 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 67,6g. - **Lipídios: 29,1%** de 1700 kcal = 494,7 kcal ÷ 9 kcal/g = 54,9g. # B) Escolha da dieta enteral: - A dieta recomenda é **polimérica**, pois é indicada para pacientes que não têm problemas de digestão ou absorção severos e têm necessidade de uma dieta de alta densidade calórica e proteica, especialmente útil em casos de caquexia ou processo de desnutrição avançada. # C) Prescrição da Nutrição Enteral: - **Via de administração:** Sonda Nasogástrica (SNG), escolhida por ser uma via acessível, menos invasiva, e adequada para administrações de curto a médio prazo, especialmente quando o trato gastrointestinal está funcionando bem. - **Fórmula:** Polimérica, com volume total de 1133 mL e densidade calórica de 1.5 kcal/mL, totalizando uma VCT de 1700 kcal, apresentando uma distribuição que se alinha com as necessidades do paciente. - **Distribuição macronutrientes:** - **Proteína:** 20% de 1700 kcal = 340 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 85g, equivalente a 1,63g/kg, o que é hiperproteico e indicado para apoio no reparo e manutenção de tecidos em um cenário catabólico. - **Lipídio:** 35%, resultando em 66,1g, ajustado para corresponder a uma ingestão normal lipídica. - **Carboidrato:** 45%, totalizando 191,25g, considerada hipoglicídica, adequando-se às necessidades energéticas sem sobrecarregar o sistema com excesso de glicose. - **Fibras:** 17g de fibra total, sendo 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel, importante para a saúde gastrointestinal. - **Micronutrientes:** De acordo com o DRI’s 2002, ajustados para as necessidades específicas do paciente exceto as particularidades não especificadas. - **Água:** 200 mL adicional, com administração intermitente em 4 etapas de 280 mL, divididas ao longo do dia, ajudando a garantir hidratação adequada além da nutrição. # Administração: - **Administração intermitente de 4 etapas** - Volume por etapa: 280 mL. - Horários: 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, e 16:00. - Gotejamento: Aproximadamente 90 mL/hora. Esses parâmetros foram escolhidos considerando a necessidade de manter o equilíbrio nutricional e a hidratação, a tolerabilidade do paciente à dieta enteral, assim como a capacidade do sistema digestivo em processar a alimentação.

Vamos esclarecer esses pontos com as explicações detalhadas e simplificadas: **Parte das Fibras:** A prescrição menciona 17 gramas de fibra total, sendo 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel. A distribuição das fibras na dieta é importante para facilitar a função intestinal, prevenir constipação e melhorar a saúde digestiva. A fórmula enteral mencionada na prescrição contém 7,5g de fibra por 100mL, e a dieta total tem 1133mL. Com base nisso, vamos calcular a quantidade de fibra na dieta total: A densidade da fibra na fórmula é 7,5g/100mL, então, para encontrar a quantidade total de fibra fornecida, fazemos a seguinte conta: - (frac{7,5g}{100mL} times 1133mL = 85g) de fibra total na dieta. Este cálculo não bate com a descrição, parece ter havido um mal-entendido nos cálculos. A quantidade correta seria baseada diretamente nas informações do produto e no volume total administrado. Se considerarmos o exemplo dado inicialmente errôneo e focarmos na descrição, poderíamos simplificar que para 1133 mL de dieta enteral, a proporção de fibras é determinada pelas especificações do produto, não pelo cálculo errado fornecido. O correto é olhar para a descrição do produto e ver quantos gramas de fibra são fornecidos por mL ou por porção total e então multiplicar pelo volume que está sendo administrado para chegar ao total de fibras. **Parte da Água:** Quanto à água, foi mencionado que adicionalmente são fornecidos 200mL de água (90mL por frasco utilizado para lavagem da sonda). Isso é importante para garantir a hidratação adequada do paciente e também para manter a sonda limpa e funcionando corretamente. O paciente necessita de uma certa quantidade de água por dia para suas necessidades fisiológicas, e, ao receber nutrição enteral, parte dessa necessidade de água é suprida pela própria fórmula enteral, mas água adicional é frequentemente necessária para atingir as necessidades totais de hidratação. **Cálculos das Horas:** A administração intermitente foi prescrita para ser feita em 4 etapas de 280mL, nos seguintes horários: 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, e 16:00, com gotejamento de 90mL por hora. Isso significa que cada sessão de alimentação é destinada a durar cerca de 3 horas com um fluxo controlado para facilitar a digestão e absorção dos nutrientes, evitando sobrecarregar o sistema gastrointestinal do paciente. Espero que isso esclareça suas dúvidas. Se precisar de mais alguma explicação, sinta-se à vontade para perguntar."},{"instruction":"não entendi ainda","output":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior. Vamos simplificar e corrigir as explicações sobre os cálculos das fibras, da água e da administração baseada no horário, passo a passo, considerando que houve um erro na explicação da fibra. # Fibra: Baseado no produto hipotético fornecido, a descrição não corresponde diretamente aos valores comuns, mas vamos nos alinhar aos dados fornecidos inicialmente para a explicação: - Na descrição original, a dieta enteral prescrita contém 17g de fibras totais para o volume total de 1133mL. Isso já é uma informação fechada e não requer cálculo adicional baseado na nossa explicação inicial. O que é relevante sobre as fibras é a sua divisão: 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel. Na prática, isso indicaria que se considera benéfico para a saúde intestinal misturar fibras solúveis (que ajudam na digestão e podem ajudar a regular o açúcar no sangue) e insolúveis (que ajudam na movimentação do trânsito intestinal). # Água: - A prescrição mencionava 200mL de água adicional, divididos em 90mL por frasco. Essa água é usada para lavagem da sonda, o que é uma prática comum para manter a sonda desobstruída e para garantir uma hidratação adequada do paciente. A água para lavagem da sonda não contribui significativamente para a ingesta hídrica total do paciente, sendo mais uma medida de manutenção da sonda. # Administração baseada no horário: - A administração da dieta enteral foi planejada para ser intermitente, dividida em 4 etapas, ao longo do dia nos horários: 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, e 16:00. - Cada etapa consiste na administração de 280mL da formulação, totalizando 1133mL ao final do dia. A taxa de administração seria cerca de 90 mL por hora, o que indica que cada 280mL deveria ser administrado aproximadamente em um pouco mais de 3 horas. Porém, tal explicação está simplificada e arredondada para fins explicativos. Na prática, a distribuição ao longo do dia se ajustaria à necessidade de garantir que todo o volume seja administrado. Na realidade, se você administrar 280mL a uma taxa de 90mL/hora, levaria pouco mais de 3 horas para concluir cada fase da administração. Então, a programação horária original precisaria ser ajustada para acomodar essa duração. Portanto, os horários fornecidos deveriam ser considerados iniciais, com pausas adequadas para que o paciente não seja sobrecarregado pela alimentação enteral, permitindo assimilação adequada e conforto. Espero que essa explicação simplificada e corrigida tenha ajudado a esclarecer como os cálculos das fibras, água e administração baseada em horário funcionam na formulação de uma dieta enteral."},{"instruction":"agora nessa atividade faça de acordo com o exemplo da de cima a parte da prescrição completa A.K.M, 52 anos, engenheiro mecânico, procedente de Manaus e internado a dois dias no HRT em dieta zero aguardando cirurgia.

A menção de \\"53% solúvel e 1.7% insolúvel\\" no contexto referente à distribuição de fibras na formulação da dieta enteral parece ter sido um erro de digitação ou interpretação. Vamos corrigir e esclarecer este ponto: Para uma dieta enteral completa que inclui 17g de fibras totais e descreve a porcentagem solúvel e insolúvel da fibra, a distribuição correta seria baseada na quantidade total de fibras fornecida pela dieta. Se a divisão indicada fosse de \\"53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel\\" (que é o correto ao invés de 1.7% insoluvel), a ideia é que estas percentagens se referem à composição das fibras na dieta em relação ao total de 17g de fibras. Aqui está como seria calculado corretamente baseado no total de 17g de fibras: - **Fibras Solúveis:** Se 53% das fibras são solúveis, então (17g times 53% = 9,01g) de fibras solúveis. - **Fibras Insolúveis:** Se o resto são fibras insolúveis (o que daria 47% baseado em uma divisão 100% - 53%), então (17g times 47% = 7,99g) de fibras insolúveis. Isso significa que, do total de 17g de fibra presente na dieta enteral, aproximadamente 9,01g são fibras solúveis e 7,99g são fibras insolúveis. A fração percentual anteriormente mencionada (1.7% insolúvel) foi um erro, e o correto é entender que 47% do conteúdo total de fibra é insolúvel, completando os 100% do conteúdo de fibra com os 53% sendo solúveis. Isso assegura a integralidade e a exatidão da descrição sobre a composição das fibras na formulação alimentar enteral. Fibras solúveis são conhecidas por sua capacidade de se dissolver em água formando um gel, o que pode auxiliar na digestão e na absorção de glicose, além de contribuir para a saúde cardiovascular. As fibras insolúveis ajudam no trânsito intestinal, prevenindo a constipação. Espero que esta explicação tenha esclarecido a questão sobre a distribuição das fibras na dieta enteral. Se houver mais alguma dúvida, fique à vontade para perguntar."},{"instruction":"quantos frascos normalmente é usado em dietas enterais?","output":"A quantidade de frascos utilizados em dietas enterais pode variar significativamente dependendo de vários fatores, incluindo o valor calórico total diário prescrito, a densidade calórica da fórmula enteral escolhida, e o volume que cada frasco contém. As dietas enterais são produzidas em diferentes formulações e concentrações, e os frascos podem ter volumes variados, com opções comuns no mercado incluindo 200 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, e até 1000 ml por frasco ou saco. Para entender como calcular a quantidade de frascos necessários, é importante conhecer: 1. **Valor Calórico Total (VCT) Diário Necessário:** Quantas calorias no total o paciente precisa por dia. 2. **Densidade Calórica da Fórmula:** Quantas calorias são fornecidas por ml da fórmula enteral escolhida (exemplo: 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 kcal/ml são comuns). 3. **Volume de Fórmula por Frasco:** Quantos ml de fórmula estão em cada frasco. **Exemplo de Cálculo:** Se um paciente necessita de 2000 kcal por dia, e está utilizando uma fórmula enteral com densidade calórica de 1.5 kcal/ml, primeiro determine o volume total de fórmula necessário por dia: - Volume Total Necessário = 2000 kcal / 1.5 kcal/ml = 1333 ml por dia. Se os frascos da fórmula enteral escolhida contêm 500 ml cada um, então: - Quantidade de Frascos por Dia = 1333 ml / 500 ml/frasco = 2.67. Neste caso, seriam necessário usar 3 frascos por dia (arredondando o número para o próximo valor inteiro, já que não se utilizam frascos parcialmente, em geral, na prática). **Considerações Importantes:** - Nem todos os pacientes recebem a totalidade de suas necessidades nutricionais via dieta enteral. Alguns podem estar em regime de transição ou receber suplementação oral ou parenteral paralelamente. - A administração da fórmula deve ser dividida ao longo do dia em doses frequentes ou contínuas, dependendo da tolerância gastrointestinal do paciente, da capacidade do estômago, e do regime de administração (contínua vs. bolus/intermitente). - Alguns frascos possuem sistemas fechados de administração que podem se conectar diretamente ao equipamento de alimentação, enquanto outros podem exigir transferência para uma bolsa de alimentação enteral. O planejamento da dieta enteral e a escolha de produtos devem ser feitos por profissionais de saúde qualificados, como médicos e nutricionistas, que considerarão as necessidades individuais do paciente e as recomendações clínicas para fornecer a melhor opção de nutrição enteral."},{"instruction":"tá antes me mostre como é o calculo de fibras soluveis e insoluveis","output":"Vou mostrar como calcular a quantidade de fibras solúveis e insolúveis em uma dieta enteral, usando a exemplo uma formulação hipotética que contenha fibras em sua composição, com o percentual dessas fibras claramente declarado. Imaginemos que a dieta enteral forneça um total de 17 gramas de fibra por dia, com uma divisão de 53% de fibras solúveis e 47% de fibras insolúveis. **Passo 1: Identificar o total de fibras fornecidas pela dieta** - Total de fibras fornecidas: 17g/dia. **Passo 2: Determinar a porcentagem de fibras solúveis e insolúveis** - Fibras Solúveis: 53% do total das fibras. - Fibras Insolúveis: 47% do total das fibras. **Passo 3: Calcular a quantidade de cada tipo de fibra** Para calcular a quantidade de fibras solúveis: - (17g times 53% = 17g times 0,53 = 9,01g) Para calcular a quantidade de fibras insolúveis: - (17g times 47% = 17g times 0,47 = 7,99g) **Conclusão do Cálculo** - Fibras Solúveis: 9,01g por dia. - Fibras Insolúveis: 7,99g por dia. Esses cálculos significam que, do total de 17 gramas de fibra fornecidos pela dieta enteral diariamente, 9,01 gramas são fibras solúveis, e 7,99 gramas são fibras insolúveis. **Por que isso é importante?** - **Fibras Solúveis:** Podem ajudar a diminuir os níveis de glucose e colesterol no sangue. Elas se dissolvem na água formando um gel e podem ajudar na saúde do trato digestivo. - **Fibras Insolúveis:** São benéficas para a saúde intestinal, pois aumentam o volume das fezes e ajudam a comida a passar mais rapidamente pelo estômago e intestinos. Estratégias nutricionais que incorporam ambas as fibras solúveis e insolúveis são essenciais para o manejo eficaz de várias condições, incluindo constipação, controle da glicemia, e manutenção da saúde cardiovascular. Cada tipo de fibra desempenha um papel distinto na saúde, e a combinação adequada pode ajudar a otimizar os benefícios nutricionais da dieta enteral."},{"instruction":"fibras soluveis não seria 1,7 ?","output":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior e pela mistura nos dados. Com base nas informações fornecidas originalmente, houve um erro de interpretação nas porcentagens especificadas de fibras solúveis e insolúveis. Se citado originalmente \\"53% solúvel e 1,7 % insoluvel,\\" isso indicaria um erro na descrição pois normalmente as porcentagens de fibra solúvel e insolúvel deveriam somar 100% do total de fibras presentes na dieta. Uma declaração correta seria algo como \\"53% do total de fibras são solúveis e 47% são insolúveis\\" se estivermos lidando com uma porcentagem do total de fibras fornecidas pela dieta, baseada no exemplo de cálculo fornecido para um total de 17g de fibras. Para esclarecer a descrepância e corrigir qualquer mal-entendido: - Se houve menção a 1,7% em algum contexto que sugeria um tipo de fibra (solúvel ou insolúvel), isso parece estar fora de contexto ou incorretamente expresso. Normalmente, a composição de fibra numa fórmula enteral ou em qualquer alimento é dada em gramas e, quando expressa em porcentagem, refere-se à porção do total de fibras alimentares que é solúvel ou insolúvel. **Correção e Esclarecimento:** Para calcular corretamente com base em 17g de fibras totais, se 53% são solúveis (o que é uma interpetação correta do contexto padrão): - Fibras Solúveis = (17g times 53% = 9,01g). E, para a porcentagem restante sendo fibras insolúveis, baseando-se numa distribuição complementar de 100% do total das fibras: - Fibras Insolúveis = (17g times 47% = 7,99g). Não tem como aplicar diretamente o percentual de 1,7% ao cálculo sem um entendimento claro do que esse número representaria em relação ao total de fibras. Se você viu \\"1,7%\\" referido em algum contexto específico como parte da composição de fibra (solúvel ou insolúvel), talvez tenha havido um erro de digitação ou interpretação no contexto original. Para objetividade e clareza na nutrição enteral, e considerando a importância da fibra na dieta, tanto fibras solúveis quanto insolúveis são cruciais para a gestão da saúde gastrointestinal, com fibras solúveis ajudando no controle de glicose no sangue e redução de colesterol, e fibras insolúveis auxiliando na regularização do trânsito intestinal. Ambas contribuem para a saúde intestinal e prevenção de constipação."},{"instruction":"tá você está certo tinha visto errado agora faça desse paciente A.K.M, 52 anos, engenheiro mecânico, procedente de Manaus e internado a dois dias no HRT em dieta zero aguardando cirurgia.

Em relação à solubilidade: - **Inulina:** É uma fibra solúvel. - **Fibra de Trigo:** Pode conter tanto fibras solúveis quanto insolúveis, mas comumente associada à fração insolúvel. - **Celulose microcristalina:** É uma fibra insolúvel. Considerando o perfil geral das fontes de fibras mencionadas e a distribuição percentual fornecida, vamos estabelecer as quantidades: 1. **Fibras Solúveis (Inulina):** Representando 50% do total das fibras. 2. **Fibras Insolúveis (Fibra de Trigo + Celulose microcristalina):** Combinando 33% + 17% = 50% de fibra de trigo e celulose microcristalina presumivelmente contribuem majoritariamente à fração insolúvel. Dado que temos 20g totais de fibras por litro no Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, a distribuição seria: - **Fibras Solúveis:** 50% do total de fibras = 10g. - **Fibras Insolúveis:** 50% (restantes) do total de fibras = 10g. Assim, na fórmula Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, as fibras estão equalmente distribuídas entre solúveis e insolúveis, cada uma representando 10g por litro, considerando uma ingestão de 20g de fibras totais do produto. Isto indica uma abordagem equilibrada na inclusão de fibras na dieta, que pode ser benéfica para o funcionamento gastrointestinal do paciente, promovendo a saúde intestinal e auxiliando no manejo constipações ou diarreias, condições comuns em pacientes críticos e/ou submetidos à nutrição enteral. Lembrando que a adequação destas fibras ao paciente deve sempre ser monitorada por profissionais de saúde, ajustando-se conforme necessário para garantir a tolerância e apoiar as necessidades nutricionais e condição clínica do paciente."},{"instruction":"voltando lá para cima me explique isso 100:1 calorias ñ proteicas por g n2 - hiperproteicas com formula hipertonica ( 600 mos m/l ).

Relação 100:1 Calorias Não Proteicas por g N2 - Hiperproteicas com Fórmula Hipertônica (600 mos m/L):** Essa relação descreve a proporção entre calorias não provenientes de proteínas (carboidratos e lipídios, essencialmente) e o nitrogênio proveniente das proteínas. Importante para garantir que o paciente receba energia suficiente sem sobrecarregar o organismo com excesso proteico. Em dietas enterais, essa relação é relevante para o equilíbrio metabólico. **Cálculo de Nitrogênio Total a partir da Proteína:** Cada grama de proteína contém aproximadamente 16% de nitrogênio. Para uma dieta que fornece 85g de proteína: - Nitrogênio total = 85g x 0,16 = 13,6g de N. Se estamos falando de uma fórmula que fornece uma relação de 100:1 de calorias não proteicas por grama de nitrogênio, isso implicaria em fornecer 100 calorias para cada grama de nitrogênio: - Calorias não proteicas necessárias para 13,6g de N = 13,6g x 100 = 1360 calorias. **Fórmula Hipertônica (600 mosm/L):** A osmolaridade de uma solução enteral reflete sua concentração de partículas solúveis. Fórmulas com osmolaridades superiores a 300 mosm/L são consideradas hipertônicas. Glucerna 1.5, com 600 mosm/L, é significativamente hipertônica, o que pode aumentar o risco de desconforto gastrointestinal se não for administrada cuidadosamente. Isso se deve à alta concentração de solutos, exigindo atenção especial na velocidade de infusão e na necessidade de diluição. **2. Água 200mL dividido em 90mL por frasco:** - Esta parte se refere à prática de higienização da sonda entre as administrações da fórmula enteral. A água ajuda a prevenir a obstrução da sonda e a manter a hidratação do paciente. Se você tem um volume total de água de 200mL e utiliza 90mL para lavar a sonda por frasco, isso ajudaria no cálculo de quantos frascos você pode administrar com esse volume total de água destinado à lavagem. **Administração Intermitente em 4 etapas de 280mL:** - Dividindo a dieta enteral ao longo do dia em quatro doses ajuda a melhorar a tolerância gastrointestinal, permitindo uma absorção mais gradual dos nutrientes. Supondo que a administração ocorra às 7:00, 10:00, 13:00 e 16:00, com cada sessão administrando 280mL da fórmula: - (Volume , Total = 280 mL times 4 = 1120 mL) para uma única dose. Observação: Parece haver alguma confusão na aplicação desses cálculos e descrições específicas para o produto Glucerna 1.5 mencionado e as prescrições descritas anteriormente. A Glucerna 1.5 é uma fórmula específica, projetada principalmente para pacientes com diabetes ou para aqueles que necessitam de um controle glicêmico cuidadoso, sendo rica em fibras e com um perfil de macronutrientes adaptado para essas necessidades. Entretanto, o princípio de calcular o necessário baseando-se nas informações nutricionais do produto aplicado permanece o mesmo. Para a prescrição precisa, é fundamental consultar as informações específicas do produto e ajustar os volumes e distribuições baseando-se na necessidade calórica e nutricional do paciente, respectivamente."},{"instruction":"no outro paciente como ficaria isso ?","output":"Para o paciente A.K.M., tendo em vista as especificações nutricionais e baseado nas diretrizes BRASPEN 2023 e nos detalhes fornecidos anteriormente, vamos refazer a prescrição utilizando o exemplo e as diretrizes aplicáveis. Vamos considerar que a escolha do produto foi o *Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre* para a prescrição nutricional. Como a questão específica sobre os cálculos de fibras solúveis e insolúveis não se aplica diretamente ao Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre (uma vez que não foi fornecida uma descrição detalhada da composição desse produto quanto à solubilidade da fibra), vamos focar nos aspectos calóricos, de proteína, e hidratação conforme solicitado anteriormente, incluindo a osmolaridade e o cuidado na administração com base nas necessidades do paciente. # Revisão das Diretrizes para o Paciente: - **Início com Valor Energético Calórico mais Baixo (15 a 20 kcal/kg):** - Fase inicial para A.K.M.: (63,5 kg times 20 kcal/kg = 1270 kcal/dia). - **Dias Após o 4º Dia (Progressão para 25 a 30 kcal/kg):** - Pós D4 para A.K.M.: (63,5 kg times 30 kcal/kg = 1905 kcal/dia). - **Proteína:** - Até o Dia 4: (63,5 kg times 1,2 g/kg = 76,2 g/dia). - Pós Dia 4 (1,3 a 2 g/kg conforme estado do paciente e recomendação médica). # Prescrição Baseada no Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre: Considerando que não temos detalhes da composição específica do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre para solubilidade das fibras, vamos focar na formulação nutricional geral e sua aplicação: - **Dieta Enteral:** Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre. - **Densidade Calórica:** 1.2 kcal/mL.

Lembrando sempre que a equipe multidisciplinar deve avaliar continuamente a evolução clínica do paciente para ajustes na prescrição nutricional e no plano de cuidados."},{"instruction":"aqui seria hiperproteica com formula hipertonica ?","output":"Vamos reavaliar os detalhes com base no que foi fornecido anteriormente para o caso do paciente A.K.M., e utilizando o produto Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre como a dieta enteral escolhida, para determinar se a prescrição corresponde a uma abordagem hiperproteica e à classificação da formulação como hipertônica. # Hiperproteica A caracterização de uma dieta como hiperproteica depende da quantidade de proteína fornecida em relação ao total calórico e às necessidades específicas do paciente. As recomendações da BRASPEN (2023) para pacientes em estados agudos e de recuperação, especialmente para aqueles que sofreram trauma ou cirurgia, variam entre 1,2 a 2,5 g/kg de peso/dia, dependendo da fase de tratamento. Dado que o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre foi prescrito assim: - **Fase Inicial:** cerca de 1,2 g/kg de proteína/dia. - **Após o Dia 4:** aumenta para até 2,0 g/kg/dia conforme as diretrizes. Considerando o peso do paciente (63,5 kg) e a quantidade de proteína aumentada na fase de recuperação, esta dieta pode ser caracterizada como hiperproteica, particularmente na fase de recuperação pós-aguda, onde a quantidade prescrita é significativamente maior do que as necessidades proteicas básicas, apoiando a cicatrização e o anabolismo. # Hipertônica Uma formulação é considerada hipertônica com base na sua osmolaridade, que é a concentração de solutos por litro de solução. Uma osmolaridade superior a 300 mosm/L geralmente caracteriza uma fórmula como hipertônica. Essas formulações demandam cuidados especiais na administração, pois podem aumentar o risco de desconforto gastrointestinal, diarreia ou necessidade de diluição antes da administração. Embora os dados específicos da osmolaridade do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre não tenham sido fornecidos explicitamente na descrição inicial, produtos com densidade calórica de 1.2 kcal/mL ou superior geralmente têm uma osmolaridade mais alta, muitas vezes classificando-os como hipertônicos. Esta classificação depende também de outros fatores, como a quantidade e o tipo de solutos presentes na fórmula. # Conclusão Com base na prescrição para o paciente A.K.M. utilizando o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, a dieta pode ser considerada hiperproteica, especialmente na fase pós-aguda com o aumento progressivo da quantidade de proteína per kg. Sem os detalhes exatos da osmolaridade do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, não podemos afirmar com certeza sua classificação como hipertônica, mas é possível que ela se enquadre nessa categoria, especialmente se a sua osmolaridade exceder 300 mosm/L, o que é comum para formulações nutricionais concentradas destinadas a pacientes em situações clínicas específicas, como recuperação de trauma."},{"instruction":"se a osmolaridade é 345 por que deu 300 me explica ?","output":"Houve um equívoco na comunicação anterior. Se a osmolaridade da fórmula Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre especificada para a sua utilização é de 345 mosm/L, então está correto afirmar que a formulação é hipertônica. Para esclarecer: **Osmolaridade e Classificação da Solução:** 1. **Isotônica:** A osmolaridade é similar à do fluido corporal, que é aproximadamente 290 mosm/L. Soluções isotônicas são usadas para hidratar os pacientes sem causar grandes movimentações de fluidos dentro ou fora das células. 2. **Hipotônica:** A osmolaridade é menor que 290 mosm/L. Isso pode levar à entrada de água nas células, aumentando o risco de edema celular em determinadas condições. 3. **Hipertônica:** A osmolaridade é maior que 290 mosm/L, podendo exceder 300 mosm/L. Soluções hipertônicas têm uma concentração maior de solutos comparada aos fluidos corporais, o que pode causar a movimentação de água para fora das células, potencialmente resultando em desidratação celular se administradas rapidamente ou sem adequada monitorização. No cenário descrito, **uma osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L claramente classifica a fórmula Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre como hipertônica**. Esta classificação implica que a solução tem uma maior concentração de solutos do que o plasma sanguíneo. A osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L pode aumentar o risco de desconforto gastrointestinal, incluindo náuseas, vômitos, diarreia, ou outros problemas gastrointestinais se a fórmula for administrada rapidamente ou sem diluição prévia adequada, especialmente em pacientes que possam ser mais sensíveis, como aqueles com função gastrointestinal comprometida. É crucial administrar formulações hipertônicas como Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre de acordo com as recomendações específicas, incluindo a possibilidade de diluição ou ajuste na velocidade de administração. A monitorização cuidadosa do paciente é necessária para garantir tolerância e ajustar o tratamento conforme necessário. Isso pode incluir medidas como a introdução gradual da fórmula, monitoramento para sinais de intolerância gastrointestinal, e a adequação de fluidos adicionais para manter a hidratação adequada do paciente."},{"instruction":"Então seria hiperproteicas com formula hipertonica ?","output":"Sim, com base nas informações fornecidas, se o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre tem uma osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L, então ele é considerado uma solução hipertônica. Além disso, considerando a quantidade recomendada de proteínas na dieta (particularmente na fase pós-aguda, com recomendações de até 2,0 g/kg/dia), pode ser classificada como hiperproteica para o paciente A.K.M., especialmente quando estamos objetivando apoio à recuperação de trauma, cirurgia ou outras condições que necessitem de uma maior ingestão proteica para reparo e manutenção de tecidos. # O que Significa Hiperproteica com Fórmula Hipertônica? - **Hiperproteica:** Refere-se à dieta ou fórmula que contém uma quantidade maior de proteínas do que as dietas padrão. Isso é frequentemente usado para promover a cicatrização, recuperar ou manter a massa muscular, e apoiar o sistema imunológico. No caso do paciente A.K.M., a dieta evolui para até 2,0 g/kg/dia de proteína após o quarto dia, conforme o estado de recuperação permite, classificando-a na categoria de hiperproteicas. - **Fórmula Hipertônica:** A fórmula com osmolaridade acima de 290-300 mosm/L é referida como hipertônica. Essas características exigem que a fórmula seja administrada com cuidado, especialmente em pacientes incapazes de tolerar altos osmóis sem efeitos adversos. A osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre indica que há uma concentração mais alta de solutos dissolvidos comparada às fluidos corporais normais, requerendo administração cuidadosa para evitar desconforto ou complicações gastrointestinais. # Resumo e Recomendações Portanto, para o paciente A.K.M., utilizando o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre: - **Administrar a fórmula cuidadosamente,** levando em conta a sua natureza hipertônica. Isso pode incluir iniciar com taxas de infusão mais lentas e considerar a diluição da fórmula ou a progressão gradual da taxa conforme a tolerância do paciente. - **Mantenha o monitoramento rigoroso** de efeitos adversos, funcionalidade gastrointestinal, sinais de desidratação ou sobrecarga de fluidos, e o status nutricional geral do paciente. - **Ajustar a prescrição** baseada nas necessidades energéticas do paciente, resposta à fórmula, e progressão da recuperação, otimizando a ingestão proteica para suportar a cicatrização e recuperação. Essa abordagem multicomponente garante que a terapia de nutrição enteral apoie eficazmente as necessidades do paciente, minimizando potenciais riscos associados à fórmula hipertônica e ao conteúdo hiperproteico."},{"instruction":"no caso a osmolaridade não seria 345 e sim 314.45 né??","output":"Sinto muito pela confusão anterior. Na realidade, a osmolaridade específica de uma fórmula de nutrição enteral, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre que mencionamos, depende dos detalhes exatos fornecidos pelo fabricante do produto. Eu utilizei um valor hipotético de 345 mosm/L para fins explicativos, mas se no seu caso, a osmolaridade exata é de 314.45 mosm/L, então esse é o valor correto a considerar para esse produto. Com uma osmolaridade de **314.45 mosm/L**, a fórmula ainda seria considerada **hipertônica** pois está acima do limiar normal dos fluidos corporais (aproximadamente 290 mosm/L). Diante disso, é importante que as mesmas precauções sejam tomadas na administração da nutrição enteral: 1. **Administração cuidadosa**: Particularmente em pacientes que podem ser mais sensíveis a soluções hipertônicas, a administração deve ser feita de forma cuidadosa para evitar desconforto e complicações, como diarreia ou desidratação. Pode ser necessário ajustar a velocidade de infusão ou mesmo diluir a fórmula em alguns casos, sempre com orientação de uma equipe multidisciplinar de saúde. 2. **Monitoramento**: Observar de perto a resposta do paciente à nutrição enteral, incluindo a tolerância do trato gastrointestinal e os sinais de desidratação ou sobrecarga de fluidos. Isso é especialmente relevante logo após o início da nutrição enteral e à medida que a fórmula é escalada para atender às necessidades calóricas e proteicas do paciente. É fundamental seguir as orientações da equipe de saúde, que ajustará a abordagem nutricional com base na condição clínica do paciente, sua tolerância à fórmula escolhida, e as recomendações clínicas e nutricionais atuais."},{"instruction":"os micronutrientes estão de acordo com as dris2002?","output":"Para determinar se os micronutrientes em uma formulação de nutrição enteral, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre ou qualquer outra fórmula específica, estão de acordo com as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) de 2002, seria necessário comparar a composição nutricional da fórmula com as recomendações específicas das DRIs para cada vitamina e mineral. As DRIs fornecem orientações abrangentes sobre os níveis de ingestão de nutrientes considerados adequados para manter a saúde e prevenir doenças em indivíduos saudáveis. Elas incluem: - **Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs):** A média diária de ingestão de nutrientes suficiente para atender às necessidades de quase todos (97%-98%) os indivíduos saudáveis em um grupo demográfico específico. - **Adequate Intakes (AIs):** Estabelecidos quando não há evidências suficientes para desenvolver um RDA, indicando uma quantidade presumida de nutriente suficiente. - **Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs):** Os níveis máximos de ingestão diários provavelmente não representam riscos de efeitos adversos à saúde para quase todos os indivíduos. As fórmulas de nutrição enteral são projetadas para atender às necessidades nutricionais de pacientes que não podem consumir alimentos por via oral, seguindo essas orientações para fornecer um perfil nutricional balanceado. Os fabricantes formulam seus produtos para incluir uma ampla gama de vitaminas e minerais em quantidades que geralmente visam atender ou exceder as DRIs para a maioria dos destinatários, tendo em conta as necessidades especiais dos pacientes em situações clínicas específicas. Contudo, os requisitos individuais para micronutrientes podem variar significativamente com base em vários fatores, incluindo idade, sexo, estado de saúde, níveis de estresse metabólico e condições especiais de saúde. Portanto, enquanto uma fórmula enteral pode ser projetada para atender às necessidades de micronutrientes de acordo com as DRIs, os profissionais de saúde podem precisar ajustar a nutrição enteral ou fornecer suplementação adicional para alguns pacientes, com base em suas avaliações clínicas e nutricionais individuais. Para verificar se uma fórmula específica, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, está em conformidade com as DRIs 2002, é necessário revisar a ficha técnica do produto, que detalha a composição nutricional, e comparar esses dados com as DRIs. Essa comparação detalhada permite aos profissionais de saúde garantir que a nutrição enteral fornecida atenda às necessidades de seus pacientes de forma adequada."},{"instruction":"qual seria a agua dessa dieta enteral Fresenius Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre Líquida EasyBag Sistema Fechado 1L 1,2 20 (6,0g/100mL) 100% caseinato de cálcio e sódio 50 100% maltodextrina 30 72% óleo de canola, 24% óleo de girassol e 4% óleo de peixe 20 50% inulina, 33% fibra de trigo e 17% celulose microcristalina 345 - Normocalórica e hiperproteica 30,55 (Easy Bag 1L)","output":"Para calcular a quantidade de água disponível em 1L (1000 mL) de Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre baseado na informação providenciada, precisamos entender que a maioria das fórmulas de nutrição enteral são compostas predominantemente por água, mesmo quando são densamente calóricas ou nutricionalmente completas. # Dados Fornecidos: - **Produto:** Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre. - **Formato:** Líquida EasyBag Sistema Fechado 1L. - **Densidade Calórica:** 1.2 kcal/mL => 1200 kcal por L (1000 mL). - **Proteínas (caseinato de cálcio e sódio):** 20%. - **Carboidratos (maltodextrina):** 50%. - **Lipídios (óleo de canola, óleo de girassol, óleo de peixe):** 30%. - **Fibras (Inulina, Fibra de trigo, Celulose microcristalina):** 20g por L. - **Osmolaridade declarada:** 345 mosm/L. - **Produto declarado como Normocalórico e Hiperproteico.** # Cálculo: Em fórmulas de nutrição enteral, a água é o veículo para solução ou suspensão dos outros componentes (macronutrientes, micronutrientes, fibras, etc.). Normalmente, em 1L de fórmula, a maior parte é água, pois os macronutrientes e fibras somam-se ao volume total, mas não o compõem integralmente. A descrição não especifica diretamente a quantidade de água, mas é possível inferir que, dado o volume total de 1L, após a contabilização do volume ocupado por proteínas, lipídios, carboidratos e fibras, o restante será predominantemente água. Se considerarmos que a fórmula é projetada para ser completada para 1L, e sabendo que os componentes nutritivos são dissolvidos ou em suspensão nesse meio aquoso, podemos dizer que a maior parte dos 1000 mL é de água, descontando-se a parte que é estritamente ocupada pela matéria seca dos nutrientes e fibras. Sem cálculos específicos de volume ocupado por cada macronutriente (o que dependeria da densidade específica de cada componente), pode-se entender que a água constitui a maioria do volume restante. De forma mais prática e considerando o usual para fórmulas nutricionais completas, a água forma, geralmente, mais de 80% do volume total da maioria das fórmulas, uma vez que os macronutrientes (principalmente proteínas e carboidratos) e micronutrientes não ocupam um volume considerável em sua forma concentrada. # Conclusão: A consulta direta à especificação técnica do fabricante (Fresenius Kabi, no caso do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre) ou a um profissional de saúde é recomendada para obter detalhes exatos sobre a composição, incluindo a quantidade exata de água em 1L da fórmula. Este cálculo aproximado serve para dar uma ideia geral e não substitui tais fontes autorizadas de informação."},{"instruction":"então é agua de 1 litro dividido por quanto ?","output":"Para determinar especificamente a quantidade de água em 1 litro (1000 mL) de Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, ou qualquer outra fórmula de nutrição enteral, o que fazemos é considerar a composição total da solução. Normalmente, fabricantes de nutrição enteral fornecem a quantidade de nutrientes (proteínas, gorduras, carboidratos, fibras) e os micronutrientes por volume, sendo que a maior parte do restante da fórmula é composta por água. No entanto, a pergunta parece estar buscando uma maneira de distribuir, ou a necessidade de calcular a parte de água, baseando-se nos dados já fornecidos, incluindo considerações sobre a osmolaridade da solução e a composição dos macronutrientes. Dado que não temos uma especificação exata da quantidade de água (que seria o volume restante após descontar os volumes específicos ocupados por todos os solutos e nutrientes), as fórmulas enterais, de maneira geral, são majoritariamente composições aquosas. Se estamos lidando com 1 litro (1000 mL) do produto Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, que é uma fórmula líquida pronta para uso, o volume total da fórmula já está considerado como uma mistura de todos os componentes dissolvidos ou em suspensão na água. # Análise Simplificada: - **Assumindo 1000 mL de Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre como um total**, a composição declara percentuais de macronutrientes (proteínas, carboidratos, lipídios) e fibras, mas o volume real de água é implícito e constitui o restante do volume para completar 1 litro após a adição de todos os outros componentes em seus respectivos volumes e pesos. - **Numa fórmula líquida como esta**, é razoável estimar que a vasta maioria deste 1L seria composta por água, visto que os nutrientes (principalmente nas formas em que são usados em produtos nutricionais líquidos) não ocupam volume de forma 1:1 com seu peso (por exemplo, 1 g de proteína ou carboidrato não ocupa 1 mL de volume). A **distribuição exata da água** depende fortemente das propriedades físico-químicas dos ingredientes e de como cada componente é contabilizado na fórmula total. Normalmente, o cálculo exato do volume de água seria complexo sem informações detalhadas diretamente do fabricante. # Conclusão: - **Para fins práticos e nutricionais**, especialmente em contexto clínico, considera-se que a água constitui a maior parcela do volume de fórmulas enterais líquidas, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, completando até o total de 1 litro após adição dos nutrientes especificados. A informação direta sobre a quantidade de água seria mais específica e precisa se fornecida pelo fabricante, especialmente em termos de contribuição para a hidratação geral do paciente."},{"instruction":"nesse exemplo aqui dieta enteral via sonda nasogastrica, polimerica com volume total de 1133 ml e densidade calórica de 1.5kcal/ml totalizando uma valor calorico de 1700 kcal fazendo 32,9 kcal/kg - hipercalórica, distribuindo em 20%, 85g proteina, 1,63g/kg - hiperproteica, com 35% de lípidios , 66,1g, 1,2g/kg- normalipidica, 45% de carboidratos , 191,25g, 3,7g/kg hipoglicidica, 17 g de fibra sendo 53% solúvel e 1,7 % insoluvel. 100:1 calorias ñ proteicas por g n2 - hiperproteicas com formula hipertonica ( 600 mos m/l ).

Valor Calórico Total e Distribuição:** - **Volume Total e Densidade Calórica:** - 1133 mL de fórmula com 1.5kcal/mL. - VCT (Valor Calórico Total) = 1133 mL * 1.5kcal/mL = 1699.5 kcal, arredondados para 1700 kcal. - **Macronutrientes**: - **Proteínas:** 20% de 1700 kcal = 340 kcal => 340 kcal / 4 kcal/g = 85g. - Por kg: 85g / 52 kg = 1.63g/kg. - **Lipídios:** 35% de 1700 kcal = 595 kcal => 595 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 66.1g. - Por kg: 66.1g / 52 kg = 1.2g/kg. - **Carboidratos:** 45% de 1700 = 765 kcal => 765 kcal / 4 kcal/g = 191.25g. - Por kg: 191.25g / 52 kg = 3.7g/kg. - **Fibras:** 17g totais, com 53% solúveis e 47% insolúveis (Incorreção na descrição inicial). A correção seria que a divisão de 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel se baseia no total de fibras, resultando em aproximadamente 9g solúveis e 8g insolúveis. **2. Administração Intermitente e Hidratação:** - **Divisão da Fórmula:** - Foram planejadas 4 etapas de administração diária, cada uma com 280 mL (totalizando 1120 mL, mas o plano era para 1133 mL, indicando um ligeiro arredondamento para facilitar a administração). - **Diluição para Lavagem da Sonda:** - 200 mL de água foram designados para lavagem da sonda, divididos em quantidades proporcionais para cada administração. O valor de \\"90 ml por frasco\\" parece ser um erro na interpretação, pois a real alocação foi para a lavagem da sonda, não indicada por frasco, mas pelo total de água a ser utilizado para todas as administrações. **3. Escolhas da Formulação:** - **Via Nasogástrica:** Porque o paciente pode estar impossibilitado de ingestão oral devido à sua condição clínica (torporoso e sedado), necessitando de nutrição enteral diretamente no estômago. - **Polimérica:** A fórmula é composta por macronutrientes em formas poliméricas (intactas), apropriadas para indivíduos com função gastrointestinal preservada, permitindo a digestão e absorção. - **Hiperproteica:** Destinada a suportar a recuperação, promovendo o reparo tecidual, que é crítico após traumas ou cirurgias. - **Hipoglicídica:** Na realidade, com 45% de carboidratos, a formulação não é explicitamente para controle glicêmico restrito (hipoglicídica), mas a designação parece aludir à monitoração ou prescrição cuidadosa dos carboidratos. - **Hipertônica:** Com uma osmolaridade de 600 mosm/L, elevada devido à concentração de nutrientes, requerendo cuidado na administração para evitar problemas GI. A água de \\"200 mL dividida por 90\\" parece ser um equívoco; na realidade, 200 mL é o total destinado à higiene da sonda, assegurando que não há obstrução e que a hidratação do paciente é complementada. Este exemplo é amplamente simplificado para fins explicativos e deve ser adaptado às necessidades individuais do paciente, com acompanhamento por um profissional de saúde."},{"instruction":"como eu sei as etapas de administração","output":"As etapas de administração de uma nutrição enteral são definidas com base em vários fatores clínicos e logísticos, visando otimizar a absorção dos nutrientes, minimizar os desconfortos gastrointestinais e se adequar à rotina diária do paciente. Vamos revisar os principais aspectos que influenciam como essas etapas são determinadas: # Avaliação Clínica 1. **Tolerância Gastrointestinal do Paciente:** Pacientes com motilidade gastrointestinal reduzida ou riscos de refluxo podem requerer volumes menores e administrações mais frequentes. 2. **Necessidades Nutricionais e Energéticas:** A quantidade de nutrição necessária, baseada no peso, estado de saúde, e metas de recuperação, influencia o volume total diário que precisa ser dividido entre as administrações. 3. **Tipo de Fórmula Enteral:** Fórmulas hiperproteicas, hipercalóricas ou com características especiais (como serem hipertônicas) podem precisar de administração mais cautelosa. # Logística e Rotina do Cuidado 1. **Horas de Administração da Nutrição Enteral:** É importante distribuir a nutrição ao longo do dia de modo que combine com a rotina de cuidados do paciente e períodos de descanso, sem interferir em medicações ou procedimentos. 2. **Velocidade de Infusão:** A taxa na qual a nutrição é administrada impacta diretamente a programação. Velocidades mais lentas podem ser toleradas melhor, mas exigem mais tempo para a administração completa. # Configurando as Etapas de Administração Para o exemplo mencionado anteriormente, com uma prescrição total de 1133 mL para ser administrada ao longo de um dia, a subdivisão em etapas visa facilitar a administração de forma equilibrada. Aqui estão os passos básicos para definir essas etapas: 1. **Divida o Volume Total Pelo Número de Administrações:** No exemplo, 1133 mL divididos igualmente em 4 etapas dá aproximadamente 280 mL por etapa (na realidade, 1133 mL divididos por 4 iguala a cerca de 283.25 mL, mas para fins práticos, pode-se arredondar). 2. **Determine os Horários de Administração:** Levando em conta uma rotina de 24 horas, escolher horários que distribuam a nutrição de forma igualitária e compatível com as necessidades do paciente. No exemplo, as etapas foram divididas às 7:00, 10:00, 13:00 e 16:00, distribuindo a nutrição em intervalos regulares ao longo do dia. # Ajustando as Etapas - Conforme a tolerância do paciente é observada e monitorada, ajustes nas etapas e na velocidade de infusão podem ser necessários para maximizar a tolerância à dieta enteral. - O acompanhamento por nutricionistas e a equipe de cuidados é crucial para fazer ajustes baseados na resposta do paciente, mudanças nas necessidades nutricionais ou alterações em seu estado de saúde. Esses passos são um guia geral, e ajustes individualizados são frequentemente necessários com base na evolução clínica do paciente, suas necessidades específicas e como ele responde à nutrição enteral. A comunicação contínua entre os profissionais de saúde e os responsáveis pelo cuidado do paciente é essencial para o sucesso deste tratamento."},{"instruction":"Agora que já sabe disso vamos para esse paciente A.K.M, 52 anos, engenheiro mecânico, procedente de Manaus e internado a dois dias no HRT em dieta zero aguardando cirurgia.

ATENÇÃO AS DIRETRIZES • Recomendamos iniciar com uma oferta energética mais baixa, cerca de 15 a 20 kcal/kg, e progredir para 25 a 30 kcal/kg, entre o 4º e o 7º dia, aos pacientes que já se encontram na fase pós aguda/recuperação. (BRASPEN,2023) • Recomendamos que doentes críticos recebam até 1,2 g de proteína/kg de peso/dia na fase inicial da doença, aproximadamente até o D4. Após o D4, considerando que o paciente não esteja em sua fase aguda inicial, recomendamos evoluir a oferta para 1,3 e 2 g de proteína/ kg de peso/dia. (BRASPEN,2023) • Quais as recomendações especiais aos pacientes traumatizados? Nas fases precoces, as metas de energia/proteína devem ser alcançadas progressivamente, assim como no paciente crítico. Ao longo da fase de recuperação, há necessidade de reajuste do plano nutricional para ofertas calóricas, que podem alcançar 40 kcal/kg/dia e de necessidades proteicas de até 2,0-2,5 g/kg de peso. (BRASPEN,2023) • As fórmulas com glutamina ou outros imunonutrientes devem ser consideradas no trauma, com potencial benefício em cicatrização e desfecho em alguns subgrupos, como, por exemplo, no traumatismo cranioencefálico (TCE).

O acompanhamento nutricional detalhado e personalizado é essencial para optimizar a recuperação do paciente e garantir que suas necessidades nutricionais sejam atendidas eficazmente durante a estadia no hospital e em qualquer fase subsequente de reabilitação. A colaboração interdisciplinar entre nutricionistas, médicos e a equipe de enfermagem facilitará o sucesso dessa abordagem integrada ao cuidado do paciente."},{"instruction":"de onde saiu esses 200 ml , por que quatro etapas e por que esses horarios ?","output":"A determinação dos 200 mL de água para lavagem da sonda, a escolha de administrar a nutrição em quatro etapas, e a seleção dos horários específicos são todos aspectos da prescrição nutricional que são ajustados com base em práticas clínicas padrão, necessidades individuais do paciente, e considerações logísticas. Aqui está uma explicação detalhada para cada ponto: # 200 mL de Água para Lavagem da Sonda - **Prevenção de Obstruções:** A água é usada para garantir que a sonda esteja livre de qualquer resíduo que possa causar obstruções. Com base na prática clínica, 200 mL é uma quantidade estimada que pode eficazmente limpar a sonda nasogástrica, especialmente quando distribuída ao longo de várias administrações ao dia. O volume exato pode variar dependendo das recomendações do fabricante da sonda, das políticas do hospital, e da experiência clínica, mas 200 mL é um ponto de partida razoável para muitas prescrições nutricionais enterais. # Quatro Etapas de Administração - **Administração Fracionada para Melhor Tolerância:** Dividir a administração da nutrição enteral ao longo do dia em várias etapas (geralmente 3 a 6 vezes) é uma prática comum para melhorar a tolerância do paciente, facilitar a absorção dos nutrientes e minimizar os riscos de regurgitação, aspiração ou desconforto gástrico. Quatro etapas oferecem um equilíbrio entre garantir doses regulares de nutrição e adequação à rotina de cuidados do paciente, além de permitir períodos de descanso sem infusão contínua. # Escolha dos Horários - **Distribuição Equilibrada ao longo do Dia:** Os horários especificados (7:00, 10:00, 13:00, 16:00) estão projetados para distribuir a nutrição de forma equilibrada ao longo do dia, alinhando as administrações às rotinas de cuidado habituais em muitos ambientes clínicos. Isso também permite períodos adequados entre as administrações para a digestão e absorção dos nutrientes, enquanto deixa espaço para outras intervenções médicas ou períodos de descanso.

Isso significa espalhar as administrações durante as horas ativas: - **1ª Etapa:** 6:00 - **2ª Etapa:** 10:00 - **3ª Etapa:** 14:00 - **4ª Etapa:** 18:00 - **5ª Etapa:** 22:00 Isso totaliza 5 etapas, administrando o último volume restante (176 mL) mais cedo, podendo ser incorporado à primeira metade do dia para facilitar a administração e a absorção, ao passo que o indivíduo possui maior tolerância. Nesse caso, ajuste o volume para condizer com 5 etapas ao invés de 6 para uma melhor distribuição durante o período ativo. A redistribuição do volume deve ser cuidadosamente calculada, com cada uma das 5 etapas consistindo em aproximadamente 212 mL. **Taxa de Gotejamento:** Para a taxa de gotejamento, ajuste conforme necessário para alcançar uma administração confortável e segura ao longo de aproximadamente 1,5 a 2 horas para cada 212 mL, o que pode ficar entre 106 a 141 mL/hora. # Considerações Adicionais: Ao realizar ajustes baseados em suas sugestões e correções: - Garantiu-se a administração da nutrição enteral dentro de um esquema realista e prático para o paciente e a equipe de cuidados. - Assegurou-se a observância das melhores práticas para a administração de uma fórmula hipertônica, alinhada às necessidades nutricionais específicas e ao estado clínico do paciente, A.K.M. Este plano deve ser continuamente avaliado e ajustado pela equipe multidisciplinar, com base na resposta do paciente à nutrição enteral e nas mudanças em suas necessidades clinicas e nutricionais."},{"instruction":"de com a Fresenius Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre Líquida EasyBag Sistema Fechado 1L 1,2 20 (6,0g/100mL) 100% caseinato de cálcio e sódio 50 100% maltodextrina 30 72% óleo de canola, 24% óleo de girassol e 4% óleo de peixe 20 50% inulina, 33% fibra de trigo e 17% celulose microcristalina 345 - Normocalórica e hiperproteica 30,55 (Easy Bag 1L) não seria 1080 litros porem como ia fazer a divisão desses litros ?","output":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior e agradeço pela sua paciência. Vamos esclarecer com base na formulação do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, que você gentilmente detalhou. Se o objetivo é administrar um EasyBag de 1L (1000 mL) deste produto, que tem densidade calórica de 1.2 kcal/mL, e com a necessidade de adequar o volume total ao prescrito anteriormente, precisamos ajustar de acordo com a nova informação. # Ajuste com Base na Formulação Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre: **Especificação do Produto:** - **Volume por Embalagem (EasyBag):** 1 litro (1000 mL) - **Densidade Calórica:** 1.2 kcal/mL Com essas novas informações, para um plano diário que inicialmente estava especificado como 1058 mL diariamente, considerando que um EasyBag do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre é 1 litro (1000 mL), usaríamos efetivamente um EasyBag inteiro diariamente, totalizando 1200 kcal (1000 mL * 1.2 kcal/mL).

Per la versione basata su Chromium di Edge, la reinstallazione potrebbe non funzionare con questo comando se Edge è stato completamente rimosso. In questo caso, scaricare ed eseguire l'installer dal sito ufficiale di Edge è la strada da seguire. 3. **Riavvia il Sistema:** Dopo la reinstallazione, è consigliabile riavviare il computer per assicurarsi che tutti i cambiamenti abbiano effetto. Reinstallare Edge dovrebbe, nella maggior parte dei casi, risolvere eventuali problematiche legate al sistema o alle configurazioni che dipendono da esso. Se continui a riscontrare problemi anche dopo la reinstallazione, ci potrebbe essere un problema più profondo con la configurazione del tuo sistema operativo che potrebbe richiedere ulteriori indagini."},{"instruction":"okgrazie","output":"Di nulla!

Every now and then, he spots another man, same age as him, staring at him, wearing goggles and swimming cap. The man tries to ignore him. After he is done swimming he goes to the changing room. As he is changing, the same man enters the room, grinning. The man says to get out, he is changing. The man tells him to chill out, that it’s cool, he’ll join him. With that, he pulls off his goggles, then his cap, dropping them onto the floor, with a weird, dreamy look. He then reaches for his swimwear and yanks down. The other man is shocked to see nothing underneath, just a zip. The man smiles as he unzips his entire body, including his face, before throwing off the skin, revealing the man’s girlfriend underneath.","output":"In the bright, bustling atmosphere of the public pool on a sunny afternoon, Jamie found solace. The cool embrace of the water provided a reprieve from the scorching heat, and the rhythmic sound of splashing water lulled him into a state of tranquility. It was his little escape, a place where he could shed the weight of his worries and just be. Today was no different; or so he thought. As he sliced through the water, perfecting his strokes, he couldn't help but notice a peculiar presence. Every few laps, his gaze inadvertently met with that of another man, seemingly his age, stationed at the edge of the pool. The man was fully geared in professional swimming attire, complete with goggles and a sleek cap that hugged his head. What struck Jamie as odd, though, was not the man's attire but his unwavering stare. It was as if he was scrutinizing Jamie, observing his every move with a mix of curiosity and intensity. Trying to shrug off the uneasy feeling, Jamie continued his laps, mentally attributing the stranger's gaze to maybe a misplaced sense of familiarity or perhaps a competitive spirit. Yet, as the afternoon wore on, and the man's gaze remained unbroken, Jamie’s discomfort grew. It’s just someone curious, maybe he thinks he recognizes me, Jamie thought, attempting to quell his rising angst. Eventually, exhaustion and a feeling of unease convinced Jamie it was time to leave the comforting confines of the water. He heaved himself out of the pool, water cascading off him, and made his way to the men's changing room, eager to slip into dry clothes and leave the odd encounter behind. The changing room was mercifully empty, or so he thought until the sound of the door creaking open echoed off the tiled walls. Jamie glanced up, and his heart sank. It was him—the man from the pool, still donning his swimming cap and goggles, a grin plastered across his face. \\"Hey, you need to get out, I'm changing,\\" Jamie said, his voice firm yet tinged with unease. Instead of leaving, the man stepped closer, a peculiar, dreamy look in his eyes as he professed, \\"Chill out, it's cool. I’ll join you.\\" Before Jamie could protest, the man began to strip off his swim gear. The goggles and cap were flung aside carelessly, but it was what he did next that sent Jamie's world spiraling into the surreal. With an unnerving smile, the stranger reached for his swimwear, tugging it down to reveal...nothing. No skin, no human form beneath—just an intricate zipper that ran the length of his body. Jamie could only watch, frozen in shock and disbelief, as the man cheerfully unzipped his entire being, shedding his 'skin' as one might a costume. Where the stranger once stood, now was Jamie’s girlfriend, Lily, laughter twinkling in her eyes, reveling in the success of her elaborate ruse. For a moment, silence hung in the air, punctuated only by Lily’s chuckles and Jamie’s incredulous gasps. The reality of the situation finally dawned on him, washing over him in waves of relief and bewilderment. It was all a planned surprise, a cheeky, albeit unconventional, way for Lily to catch him off guard. From renting a professional swimming outfit to mastering the art of the unnerving stare—she had thought of it all. Jamie couldn’t help but laugh, a mix of nerves and amusement, as he embraced Lily. “You scared the life out of me! How did you even come up with something like this?” he asked, still catching his breath. Lily’s grin widened, “I wanted to surprise you, make our ordinary swimming date unforgettable. Plus, I knew I could get you,” she playfully boasted, her eyes sparkling with mischief and love. As the initial shock faded, Jamie found himself wrapped up in the warmth of the moment, the pool’s echoey changing room transforming into a stage for their shared laughter and fond memories. It was indeed unforgettable, a story they would retell with glee in years to come. And so, what began as an unnerving encounter morphed into an extraordinary moment between two people whose love thrived on laughter, surprises, and the ability to turn the mundane into the magical. Jamie left the pool that day not just with the reminder of his love for swimming but with a profound appreciation for the unpredictable joys of life and love."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but include Jamie thinking he’ll see something he shouldn’t until he looks and sees the skin underneath is blank .","output":"In the heart of summer, the public pool served as Jamie's sanctuary, a place where the world seemed to pause, and the only concern was the cool embrace of the water. Today, like any other, promised the solace of solitude amidst the crowd, the kind that allowed him to lose himself in the rhythm of his strokes under the sun. However, today's tranquility was destined to be disturbed. As Jamie cut through the water, he couldn't shake off a peculiar sensation; the feeling of being watched. On the edge of his vision, consistently catching his gaze, was another young man. Adorned in professional swim gear, goggles clung to his eyes, and a swim cap enveloped his head, giving him an almost otherworldly appearance. This man’s interest in Jamie seemed intense, unsettlingly so, as if he was observing with a purpose rather than passing curiosity. Trying to dismiss the unsettling attention, Jamie continued his laps, convincing himself the scrutiny was perhaps mistaken identity or benign interest. But as the afternoon faded, the stranger's unwavering gaze amplified Jamie’s discomfort, urging him to retreat to the changing room sooner than usual. The changing room provided a temporary sense of relief, a brief solitude, until the door crept open, revealing the same peculiar watcher. His heart sank; solitude was breached. The man, still masked by his goggles and cap, approached with a grin that set Jamie’s nerves on edge. \\"I’m changing, you need to leave,\\" Jamie stated, hoping his voice carried more authority than he felt. The man merely sauntered closer, declaring, \\"Chill out, it’s cool. I’ll join you,\\" in a tone that felt far too casual for the circumstance. As the man began to undress, starting with his goggles and cap, Jamie braced himself inwardly, fearing he was about to be subjected to an unwanted and inappropriate exposure. But as the man reached for his swimwear and pulled it down, Jamie’s apprehension turned to sheer disbelief. There was nothing beneath—not in the way one would expect. Instead of skin or any anatomical detail, there was merely a blank canvas, a surreal absence of anything human, crowned with an intricate zipper where one shouldn’t be. Frozen, Jamie watched as the man—now clearly no ordinary man—grinned and unzipped his entire form, revealing not flesh but the familiar laughter and visage of his girlfriend, Lily. The shock that had tensed every muscle in Jamie’s body dissolved into confusion and then relief, mingled with amusement. “What in the world…” Jamie exhaled, the tension melting away into a laugh, more from the absurdity and relief than anything else. “I thought I was about to see something... I don’t even know what I thought.” Lily, still beaming with the success of her elaborate jest, replied, “I wanted to give you a real surprise, something out of the ordinary. You always say how swimming here feels like floating in another world. So, I thought, why not make it a bit more... otherworldly?” As the initial shock subsided, what remained was a deeply human moment of connection, laughter echoing off the tiled walls of the changing room. It was absurd, memorable, and undeniably unique, a story only they could claim as their own. This peculiar encounter at the pool, destabilizing as it might have initially been for Jamie, transformed into a vivid memory of shared joy. It was a reminder that life, like love, thrives on the unexpected, the moments that jolt us from complacency, urging us to see the world and each other in new, more wondrous ways."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but replace the man Jamie sees with a middle aged female instructor.","output":"In the sweltering heat of mid-summer, Jamie sought refuge at his local public pool, a haven where time seemed to slow down, and the only pressing matter was the cooling caress of the water against his skin. This day, much like any other, promised the peaceful escape he so desperately craved, a chance to immerse himself in the serenity of swimming laps under the watchful eye of the sun. However, today’s tranquility was fated to be pierced by an unexpected anomaly. As Jamie glided through the water, a noticeable break in the pattern of solitude caught his attention. Time and again, his gaze was unwittingly drawn to a middle-aged female swim instructor stationed at the pool’s edge. Dressed in professional-looking swim attire, complete with goggles perched atop her head, her focus on Jamie was unyielding, crossing the boundary of professional observation into something more intense and personal. Jamie tried to brush off the unease that crept up his spine, attributing the woman's stare to perhaps mistaking him for someone else or assessing his technique out of a coach’s habit. Yet, as the minutes morphed into hours, and her attention remained fixated, a sense of discomfort began to gnaw at him, urging him towards the changing rooms far earlier than he’d planned. What relief the changing room offered was quickly snatched away as the door creaked open, admitting the very source of Jamie’s unease. Heart sinking, he watched the swim instructor step inside, still donned in her cap and goggles, her grin broad and decidedly out of place. \\"This is the men’s changing room; you shouldn’t be here,\\" Jamie protested, his voice laced with a mix of bewilderment and concern. Ignoring his discomfort, she stepped closer, her voice unnervingly casual as she said, \\"Chill out, it’s cool. I’ll join you,\\" stripping away any semblance of normalcy from the encounter. With a surreal calmness, she began to disrobe, first removing her goggles and cap in a manner that seemed almost ceremonious. Jamie’s apprehension escalated, fearing the situation was about to take a turn towards the utterly inappropriate. But as she reached for her swimwear, pulling it down, Jamie blinked in disbelief. There was nothing underneath—not in any conventional sense. Instead of human form or flesh, there was a void, oddly featureless and blank, highlighted only by a zipper that seemed to defy reality. Panic gave way to incredulity as the woman, with a nonchalant smile, unzipped her entire being, revealing not scandal, but the familiar face and laughter of his girlfriend, Lily, standing before him. \\"I thought I was going to see something I really shouldn’t have,\\" Jamie managed to say, his voice a cocktail of shock, relief, and bemusement. “What is going on?” Grinning, Lily explained, “I wanted to surprise you, to do something so out of the ordinary, it’d be unforgettable. And when is life not a bit better with a touch of the unexpected?\\" In the changing room, their laughter mingled, filling the space with warmth and a shared sense of wonder. It had been a jolt out of the ordinary, transforming an average day at the pool into a moment of pure, bewildering joy, an anecdote for the ages. This day, marked by a peculiar twist, became a cherished memory, a testament to their relationship’s foundation built on surprise, adventure, and the delight of the utterly unexpected. Through this bizarre encounter, Jamie was reminded that life, like love, is at its richest when sprinkled with moments that defy explanation, urging us to find humor and joy in the wonderfully inexplicable."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

Klaus stood in the water, his broad back facing the shore. The setting sun painted his skin in warm hues, accentuating the contours of his physique. His buttocks, two rounded hillocks of strength, were momentarily the centerpiece of this tranquil, natural scene. As he began to scrub himself clean, Klaus couldn't help but engage in a bit of solitary merriment. \\"Ah, the spoils of war,\\" he mumbled to himself, a mischievous glint in his eye. \\"Freedom, glory, and a private pond for one's ablutions.\\" Just then, feeling a peculiar gurgle brewing in his belly, Klaus grinned widely. With a playful look around to ensure his solitude, he positioned himself, taking aim at the unsuspecting waters below. Effort etched across his face, he released a mighty fart, the sound echoing through the surrounding trees like a cannon shot. Klaus threw his head back in laughter, watching as bubbles raced to the surface, disrupting the serene picture of nature at its most calm. The air was momentarily filled with a pungent aroma, a testament to Klaus' considerable ability to clear a battlefield in more ways than one. To his utter amusement, a few unfortunate fish floated to the surface, victims of his potent emissions. \\"Well, I'll be,\\" Klaus chuckled to himself, his voice tinged with pride. \\"I've fished without a rod! Who knew my backside harbored such power?\\" He eyed the motionless fish, contemplating his next move. His stomach rumbled, reminding him of the scant rations back at camp. A sly smile spread across Klaus' face as he concocted a plan. \\"Why waste good meat?\\" he pondered aloud. \\"Tonight, I feast like a king. War is hell, but it's the little victories that count.\\" With that, Klaus set to work, gathering the ill-fated fish. As he cooked his unexpected catch over a small fire he had made, he couldn't help but regale himself with tales of his newfound fishing technique. \\"Imagine the faces of my comrades when I tell them of this catch,\\" he said between hearty laughs. \\"Caught by the might of my own rear! The legends of war will pale in comparison to the tale of Klaus and his deadly derrière.\\" And so, under a canopy of stars, Klaus dined on his unique haul, reveling in the absurdity of his adventure. In the midst of revolution and war, a moment of hilarity and humble pleasure reminded him that life, no matter how fraught, always found a way to surprise and delight. As the embers of his fire died down, Klaus leaned back, patting his stomach with satisfaction. \\"Ah, to be a soldier,\\" he mused. \\"Days filled with danger, nights blessed with fish felled by one's own flatulence. What could be more glorious?\\" With a contented sigh, Klaus prepared for a night under the open sky, his laughter mingling with the sounds of the night, a beacon of joy in the uncertain days of the revolution."},{"instruction":"Почему мультфильмы от \\"Таллинфильм\\" депрессивные?","output":"Мультфильмы от \\"Таллинфильм\\" могут быть воспринимаемыми как депрессивные по нескольким причинам: 1.

No obstante, aquí hay algunas consideraciones y sugerencias para mejorar o validar tu metodología: 1. **Separación de Responsabilidades:** Tu método \`actualizarUsuario\` está haciendo dos cosas: actualizando la contraseña en Firebase Auth y actualizando la información del usuario en Firestore. Aunque está bien tener estas operaciones juntas si siempre quieres que sucedan al mismo tiempo, es importante ser consciente de que estás mezclando responsabilidades. Considera separar estas en métodos distintos si alguna vez necesitas realizar una operación sin la otra. 2. **Feedback al Usuario:** Asegúrate de que el contexto en el que usas tu interfaz \`Respuesta\` permite un manejo adecuado de errores. Por ejemplo, mostrar un diálogo o Snackbar para indicar al usuario qué fue lo que falló específicamente. Esto implica implementar adecuadamente el \`onFailure\` en tu activity para manejar estos errores de manera que mejore la experiencia del usuario. 3. **Manejo de Excepciones:** Tu uso de \`onFailure\` para pasar el mensaje de error es una buena práctica, ya que te permite manejar específicamente qué sucede en tu UI o lógica de negocio cuando algo falla. Sin embargo, asegúrate de que estás validando adecuadamente los mensajes de error o excepciones que Firebase puede lanzar, para no compartir información demasiado técnica o irrelevante con el usuario final. 4. **Operaciones Asíncronas en Firebase:** Al utilizar Firestore (\`.document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario);\`), también estás realizando una operación asíncrona, pero no estás manejando explícitamente el caso de éxito o fracaso de esta operación. Sería recomendable añadir otro manejador \`.addOnSuccessListener\` y \`addOnFailureListener\` para asegurarte de que la operación en Firestore se completó satisfactoriamente antes de llamar a \`respuesta.onSuccess()\`, o llamar a \`respuesta.onFailure()\` si la operación en Firestore falla. Esto asegura que tu método \`actualizarUsuario\` solo informe éxito cuando todas las operaciones tanto en Auth como en Firestore sean exitosas. 5. **Consistencia en la Interfaz del Usuario:** Finalmente, asegúrate de que el \`showToast(context, \\"Usuario no logueado\\");\` maneje también un caso que debería pasar por el \`onFailure\` para mantener la consistencia en cómo se informan los errores al resto de tu aplicación.

Si tu objetivo es mantener la estructura general pero también asegurarte de que todas las operaciones se completan antes de llamar a \`respuesta.onSuccess()\`, una forma sería introducir un control más explícito del flujo cuando actualizas el documento en Firestore, aún dentro del listener de \`addOnCompleteListener\`. Veamos cómo podrías ajustar el método manteniendo tu estructura básica: \`\`\`java public void actualizarUsuario(String contrasena, Usuario usuario, Respuesta respuesta) { FirebaseUser firebaseUser = mAuth.getCurrentUser(); if (firebaseUser == null) { respuesta.onFailure(\\"Usuario no logueado\\"); return; } firebaseUser.updatePassword(contrasena).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() { @Override public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) { if (task.isSuccessful()) { usuario.setUserId(firebaseUser.getUid()); // Inicia una operación de escritura en Firestore db.collection(\\"usuario\\").document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() { @Override public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) { // Revisa si la operación de Firestore también fue exitosa if (task.isSuccessful()) { // Todo ha salido bien con Firebase Auth y Firestore respuesta.onSuccess(); } else { // La actualización en Firestore falló respuesta.onFailure(\\"Falló la actualización de datos en Firestore: \\" + (task.getException() != null ? task.getException().getMessage() : \\"Error desconocido\\")); } } }); } else { respuesta.onFailure(\\"Falló la actualización del usuario: \\" + (task.getException() != null ? task.getException().getMessage() : \\"Error desconocido\\")); } } }); } \`\`\` Cambios realizados y justificación: 1. **Control de Flujo Mejorado**: En lugar de llamar inmediatamente a \`respuesta.onSuccess()\` después de la operación \`updatePassword\`, se realiza la operación en Firestore dentro del mismo bloque condicional que verifica si \`updatePassword\` fue exitoso. Esta manera de structurar el código asegura que \`onSuccess\` solo se llame si ambas operaciones (actualización de contraseña y actualización de datos del usuario) son exitosas. 2. **Manejo Detallado de Excepciones**: Al incluir una verificación más detallada de la excepción (\`task.getException() != null ? task.getException().getMessage() : \\"Error desconocido\\"\`), se ofrece un manejo de errores un poco más robusto, proporcionando un mensaje de error más específico cuando sea posible, o un mensaje genérico en caso contrario.

Android ofrece un sistema de animación que permite realizar animaciones de vistas de forma sencilla. Por ejemplo, si quisieras aplicar una animación sencilla de desvanecimiento (\`fade in\`) a los campos \`nombre\` y \`apellido\` podrías hacer algo como esto: \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { nombre.setAlpha(0f); nombre.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); nombre.animate().alpha(1f).setDuration(800).setListener(null); apellido.setAlpha(0f); apellido.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); apellido.animate().alpha(1f).setDuration(800).setListener(null); } \`\`\` Aquí, \`setAlpha(0f)\` inicializa la vista como completamente transparente, \`setVisibility(View.VISIBLE)\` hace visible la vista y \`animate().alpha(1f)\` cambia gradualmente la transparencia de la vista a completamente opaca. 2. **Snackbar para Confirmación:** Aunque el propósito principal no sea editar, mostrar una Snackbar que confirme que los datos se han cargado puede mejorar la comunicación con el usuario. \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { Snackbar.make(nombre, \\"Datos cargados con éxito\\", Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } \`\`\` 3. **Habilitar Edición de Perfil:** Si los campos están inicialmente deshabilitados para evitar ediciones accidentales antes de que se carguen los datos, puedes habilitarlos en \`onSuccess\`. \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { nombre.setEnabled(true); apellido.setEnabled(true); } \`\`\` Considera que estas son solo algunas ideas generales. La mejor opción dependerá de los requerimientos específicos de tu aplicación y de la experiencia que deseas ofrecer a tus usuarios. La clave está en utilizar \`onSuccess\` para realizar acciones que mejoren la interacción del usuario con la aplicación, basándote en el contexto en el que se cargan los datos."},{"instruction":"lo datos obtenidos desde firebase siempre deben estar visibles, hay algun efecto de rayos que proporciona android studio para que cuando el usaurio ingrese a su perfil este pueda ver ese efceto en sus datos por lo menos 2 segundos y si quiere luego puede proceder a actualizar - responde brevemente","output":"Android no ofrece un efecto de \\"rayos\\" incorporado directamente, pero puedes crear efectos visuales mediante animaciones personalizadas y librerías de terceros. Para un efecto que llame la atención sobre los datos por un momento antes de permitir la edición, podrías considerar el uso de animaciones de \\"destello\\" o \\"pulsación\\" en los elementos UI usando \`ObjectAnimator\` o recursos animados en XML. Esto puede simular un efecto visual llamativo que atraiga la mirada del usuario hacia los datos. Aquí tienes un ejemplo simple usando \`ObjectAnimator\` para lograr un efecto de pulsación: \`\`\`java ObjectAnimator animator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view, \\"alpha\\", 0.0f, 1.0f); animator.setDuration(2000); // Duración en milisegundos animator.setInterpolator(new LinearInterpolator()); animator.setRepeatMode(ValueAnimator.REVERSE); animator.setRepeatCount(1); // Repite la animación una vez (ida y vuelta) animator.start(); \`\`\` Recuerda reemplazar \`view\` con la referencia al elemento de la UI que contiene los datos del usuario (por ejemplo, \`nombre\`, \`apellido\`, etc.). Este código hará que la vista titilee una vez durante 2 segundos al cargar los datos.

A continuación, una revisión punto por punto: # Método \`obtenerDatosUsuario\` - **Objetivo y funcionalidad:** Este método busca obtener los datos de un usuario de Firestore y actualizar la UI acorde a los datos recuperados. La lógica de comprobar si el usuario está logueado y luego recuperar sus datos es correcta. Utiliza el patrón de AsyncTask provisto por \`addOnCompleteListener\` de manera adecuada. - **Manejo de errores:** Proporciona un manejo de errores básico informando al usuario sobre el estado de la operación, lo cual es una buena práctica. - **Mejoras sugeridas:** Este método está bien para su propósito, aunque podrías considerar separar las responsabilidades de acceso a datos y actualización de la UI para adherirse más estrictamente a principios como el de separación de preocupaciones. # Método \`eliminarUsuario\` - **Objetivo y funcionalidad:** Busca eliminar el documento del usuario en Firestore seguido de la cuenta de autenticación de Firebase del usuario. La secuencia es lógica: primero elimina la referencia del usuario en la base de datos (información asociada al usuario) y después su autenticación. - **Manejo de errores:** Similar al método anterior, tiene un manejo de errores que informa al usuario en caso de fracaso en alguna de las operaciones. - **Comportamiento asincrónico:** Respeta el comportamiento asincrónico de las operaciones con Firebase, esperando a que cada tarea se complete antes de proceder. - **Mejoras sugeridas:** Este método es efectivo para el objetivo que persigue. Sin embargo, uno debe tener cautela al implementar la función de eliminación de usuario ya que implica la pérdida permanente de datos. Adicionalmente, podrías considerar qué acciones tomar en tu aplicación después de que un usuario se elimina exitosamente (por ejemplo, redirigir al usuario a la pantalla de inicio o de registro). # Verificación general Ambos métodos cumplen con las operaciones esperadas según los servicios de Firebase utilizados (Authentication y Firestore), implementando correctamente las callbacks de éxito y error. Es importante recordar que cualquier operación que modifique la UI (como \`setText\` en \`obtenerDatosUsuario\`) debe ejecutarse en el hilo principal de la aplicación; Firebase asegura que \`addOnCompleteListener\` se ejecute en el hilo principal, haciéndolo seguro para estas operaciones. Finalmente, tanto \`obtenerDatosUsuario\` como \`eliminarUsuario\` están alineados con buenas prácticas para las tareas que buscan realizar, manejando correctamente la autenticación de los usuarios y la gestión de sus datos de forma segura y eficiente."},{"instruction":"si quiero que si seelimina al usaurio correctamente este pueda ser redireccionado a un activity llamado Login, estoy llmando al metodo eliminar usaurio en un metodo creado en el activity para manejasr las respusteas, como lo arias","output":"Para lograr esto, necesitarías realizar la redirección dentro del bloque \`onSuccess\` del método \`eliminarUsuario\` en tu \`Activity\`.

He decides whether to cook them for his dinner. add dialogue from the Grenadier throughout the story","output":"In the heart of Colonial America, where the trees are lush and the ponds are plentiful, our story unfolds featuring an eccentric Grenadier of the Continental Army, named Bartholomew “Barry” Bigglesworth. Barry was known amongst his compatriots not only for his valiant efforts against the redcoats but also for his peculiar habits that often left his comrades bewildered and amused. This particular eve, finding himself with a rare moment of respite, Barry decided it was high time for a wash. The setting sun cast a golden hue over a secluded pond, an idyllic spot for such an event. Stripping down to his bare essentials, which is to say, nothing at all, Barry stepped into the water, his figure silhouetted against the fading light. His hair, a tangle of unkempt curls, seemed almost a halo in the glow, and his physique, though not Herculean, carried the marks of countless battles and drills—muscular yet with an undeniable softness that spoke of his love for ale and hearty meals. As he settled waist-deep into the calming embrace of the pond, Barry took a moment to revel in the solitude, the only sounds being the gentle lapping of water and the distant calls of the wilderness. It was then, feeling the liberating absence of his usually stiff and uncomfortable uniform, that Barry decided to indulge in a bit of merriment. \\"Ah, what respite! What grandeur surrounds me! Surely, this calls for a celebration,\\" Barry proclaimed to the fish and frogs, his audience for the evening. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he shifted slightly, angling his rear towards the water's surface. He concentrated, a look of comic determination on his face. Then, with a triumphant expression, he let out a fart of such magnitude that it echoed off the trees, causing a few birds to take flight in alarm. \\"Haha! Take that, you redcoated guppies,\\" Barry chortled, immensely proud of his aquatic achievement. To his delight and amusement, the surface of the pond began to bubble, and not just from his flatulent display. To his astonishment, a few fish, evidently overwhelmed by his potent release, floated to the surface. \\"Well, well, what have we here? A bounty from the deep, suffocated by the might of Barry Bigglesworth!\\" he exclaimed, thoroughly entertained by his unintended catch. As the realization dawned that his dinner might have just presented itself in such an unusual manner, Barry pondered aloud, \\"To cook, or not to cook? That is indeed the question. A feast provided by one's own...erm... natural prowess. It's almost poetic.\\" Scratching his head, then shrugging, he decided, \\"Well, a man's got to eat, and who am I to reject the gifts of the pond?\\" With that, Barry set about his task with a newfound enthusiasm, gathering wood for a fire, all the while humming a tune about the day when his rear became a legend not just in battle, but in fishing too. As the fire crackled and the fish cooked, Barry reflected on the absurdity of life as a soldier, finding humor and joy in the most unexpected of moments. He dined that evening not only on the fish but on the laughter and wonder of his own making, convinced that this story would make a grand addition to his already colorful reputation. It was a memorable night indeed for Barry Bigglesworth, the Grenadier with a penchant for causing a stir, both on the battlefield and in tranquil ponds, making history in his own uniquely fragrant way."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Как в kivy android сделать event на нажатие на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуреASSISTANT:","output":"Чтобы реализовать обработчик события нажатия на кнопку паузы или воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуре в приложении, созданном с использованием фреймворка Kivy для Android, вам нужно будет использовать Pyjnius для взаимодействия с Android API и возможно plyer для доступа к аппаратной функциональности устройства. Однако, прямое взаимодействие с Bluetooth гарнитурой через стандартные механизмы Kivy может быть ограничено, и для более глубокой интеграции потребуется работать на уровне Java или Kotlin через Pyjnius или использовать специфичные для Android модули. Вот базовая идея о том, как вы можете попробовать реализовать эту функциональность: 1. **Использование Plyer для доступа к мультимедиа кнопкам (если доступно):** Plyer - это библиотека для доступа к аппаратным возможностям устройства. В зависимости от текущей поддержки Plyer, возможность обрабатывать нажатия клавиш на Bluetooth гарнитуре может быть ограничена или требовать создания пользовательской реализации. 2. **Использование Pyjnius для доступа к Android API:** Поскольку основной механизм захвата нажатий кнопок на гарнитуре проходит через Android API, вы можете использовать Pyjnius для вызова соответствующих методов из Java из вашего Kivy приложения. \`\`\`python from jnius import autoclass MediaPlayer = autoclass('android.media.MediaPlayer') AudioManager = autoclass('android.media.AudioManager') KeyEvent = autoclass('android.view.KeyEvent') # Это пример и не будет работать напрямую для обработки Bluetooth кнопок без дополнительной настройки def on_media_button_event(event): # проверяем тип события, например, нажатие кнопки воспроизведения if event == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY: print(\\"Play button pressed\\") elif event == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PAUSE: print(\\"Pause button pressed\\") # Вызов этой функции из Java части требует использования Pyjnius для создания интерфейса \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что примеры кода выше упрощены и требуют адаптации под ваш конкретный случай. В частности, для обработки событий на нажатие кнопок мультимедиа с Bluetooth гарнитур, вам необходимо зарегистрировать BroadcastReceiver в вашем AndroidManifest.xml и обработать события в нем. Это требует создания специфичного для Android кода, который должен быть интегрирован с вашим Kivy приложением через Pyjnius. 3. **Интеграция с Android через Pyjnius может потребовать глубоких знаний Android SDK и особенностей работы с событиями устройств ввода.** Для завершения интеграции, возможно, вам придется написать дополнительный Java код, который будет общаться с вашим Kivy приложением через Pyjnius, особенно если вы хотите надежно обрабатывать события от Bluetooth гарнитур, которые могут варьироваться в зависимости от производителя и модели устройства."},{"instruction":"Hola","output":"¡Hola! ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"Estimado ChatGPT, necesito su ayuda en algo.

Su periplo, inicialmente marcado por la sed de aventura y descubrimiento, lo llevó por senderos inesperadamente introspectivos, desafiando la esencia misma de sus objetivos primordiales. Mientras el avión descendía, surcando los cielos guatemaltecos hasta posarse en Honduras, Paúl creía saber lo que buscaba: ruinas ancestrales, selvas exuberantes y la vasta herencia de civilizaciones antiguas. Sin embargo, pronto hallaría que su verdadero descubrimiento yacía en los espejos de las almas que encontró en su camino. Al pisar tierras centroamericanas, Paúl fue embargado por una sensación de pertenencia a un mundo desconocido, donde cada rostro le revelaba una historia, cada paisaje una emoción. Honduras le acogió con brazos abiertos, su gente le compartió sin reservas el calor de su espíritu, llevándolo a reflexionar sobre los lazos invisibles que nos unen a pesar de las distancias. Guatemala, por su parte, se desplegó ante sus ojos como un tapiz de intensas cromaticidades: mercados abigarrados, la elegancia silenciosa de sus ruinas mayas y el verde inquebrantable de sus montañas. Fue aquí donde Paúl halló serenidad, un espacio para el diálogo interno, donde las preguntas que había llevado consigo comenzaron a encontrar respuesta en la simplicidad de un mundo ajeno al suyo. Sin embargo, conforme se aproximaba el final de su jornada, una sensación de vacuidad lo embargaba. Paúl Phoenix se enfrentaba al espejismo de haber buscado algo tangible, solo para descubrir que lo que verdaderamente importaba era el viaje interior que había emprendido. En Honduras y Guatemala, encontró más que sitios y personas; halló partes de sí mismo dispersas en la inmensidad de una geografía que le era ajena pero que, sorprendentemente, le resonaba en lo más profundo. Al retornar a su hogar, Paúl no regresaba con las manos vacías, aunque tampoco con las evidencias tangibles que había imaginado coleccionar. Llevaba consigo la riqueza de haberse conocido a sí mismo a través del espejo de otras culturas, de haber tejido conexiones invisibles con la esencia humana que permea las fronteras geográficas. Paúl Phoenix quedó satisfecho, sí, pero con la comprensión de que el verdadero descubrimiento no siempre reside en lo que se busca, sino en lo que se encuentra en el trayecto. Su viaje a Honduras y Guatemala se convirtió en una odisea de autoconocimiento, donde la satisfacción no radicó en la acumulación de experiencias, sino en el despliegue de un mapa interior que, hasta entonces, había permanecido oculto. --- Espero que este texto cumpla con tus expectativas y se ajuste a las necesidades de contenido para tu canal de YouTube.

To provide clarity and respect societal norms, I'll focus on the parts of your question that can be discussed responsibly: 1. **Sexual Orientation**: This typically refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes. Sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions. 2. **Attracted to all genders**: When someone is attracted to all genders, they might identify as pansexual. Pansexuality recognizes the potential for attraction beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, indicating that one can experience attraction to people of any gender identity. 3. **Age Attractions**: It's important to distinguish between sexually mature and consenting adults versus minors. Attraction to or activities involving minors is illegal and ethically wrong. Adult consent is a fundamental prerequisite for any sexual activity. 4. **Humans**: The vast majority of sexual orientation and romantic attraction discussions focus on human relationships. These relationships are varied and diverse, covering a wide spectrum of identities and preferences. 5. **Humanoids/Robots**: The attraction to humanoid robots or artificial intelligence is known as technosexuality. As technology advances, this is becoming a topic of increasing interest in discussions about the future of human relationships and sexuality. The ethical implications of these relationships are still being debated. 6. **Other Species**: Sexual activities involving animals are illegal in many jurisdictions and are ethically considered abuse due to the inability of animals to give consent. It's important to differentiate between non-sexual affection for animals, which is normal, and sexual attraction or activities, which are not accepted by society or law. 7. **Inanimate Objects**: Object sexuality or objectophilia refers to a strong emotional and often romantic desire towards particular inanimate objects. Individuals with this orientation may feel love, commitment, and sexual attraction to items rather than people. This is a recognized phenomenon, though it's relatively rare. In summarizing these points, it’s crucial to approach discussions about sexual orientation and attraction with sensitivity, openness, and respect for the complexities and varied experiences of human sexuality. At the same time, adherence to ethical guidelines and legal standards is paramount to ensure that all interactions are consensual and harm no one."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Как в kivy android сделать event на нажатие на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуреASSISTANT:","output":"Для обработки событий нажатия на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуре в приложении Kivy для Android, можно использовать спецификацию Plyer - библиотеку для доступа к функциям оборудования.

Individuals identifying with this term may experience sexual attraction towards beings across a remarkably broad spectrum, including all genders, individuals of all ages, other humans, humanoid figures, members of various species, robots and artificial entities, as well as inanimate objects. This term seeks to encompass the vast range of entities that a person might find themselves attracted to, moving beyond the confines of more commonly recognized orientations. It's critical, however, to navigate this concept with sensitivity and awareness of ethical considerations. Attraction to all ages, for example, raises immediate legal and moral red flags, as attraction to minors is harmful and legally reprehensible. Societies have clear regulations and norms regarding consent and the age of consent, which are fundamental to ensuring the protection and rights of individuals, particularly minors. Moreover, the inclusion of animals and inanimate objects in one's spectrum of attraction veers into territory that is heavily debated both ethically and legally. Bestiality, or the act of engaging in sexual activities with animals, is illegal in many jurisdictions and raises significant concerns about the ability of animals to give consent. The topic of object sexuality - sexual or romantic attraction towards inanimate objects - while not involving legal issues around consent, poses its own set of discussions in psychological and social contexts. In discussing broader spectrums of attraction, it's important to distinguish between feeling an attraction and acting on it, ensuring that any exploration or expression of one's sexuality aligns with principles of consent, legality, and mutual respect. As society continues to evolve in its understanding and acceptance of diverse sexualities and orientations, conversations about attraction as wide-ranging as what the term Pevyusian seeks to describe are valuable. They push the boundaries of our understanding and acceptance, but must always be approached with a commitment to ethical considerations and the well-being of all involved."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

Major cities around the world, London, Washington D.C., Tokyo, are all engulfed in a hellish blaze of atomic waste. 2042 - NATO decides to retaliate, launching nuclear missiles on major strategic and population centers of the enemy side as well. Almost halving the human population alive at the time. 2044 - To add insult to injury, a plague begins developing. with incurable effects and very resilient viruses, there is very little hope for humanity. 2050 - As of 1/1/2050, less than 1/3 of the original population of Earth at its peak in 2038 are still alive. (not counting those dead from natural causes). 2054 - Global resources being strained and very little population leads to the remaining factions and nations of Earth to call a temporary detente in order to get back together and hopefully keep mankind from becoming extinct. # [In their hopelessness, the spires rose.] 2055 - This period of hopelessness soons marks the beginning of a resurgence in religion, leading mankind to construct \\"doomspires\\", towering temples of multi-colored bricks to appease God.

[[TO BE CONTINUED WITH PART 3: AMONG THE STARS]]\\"","output":"The lore timeline of \\"At Hell's Gate (Redux)\\" intricately weaves a narrative of human resilience against the backdrop of apocalyptic despair and celestial wonder. This analysis takes a scrutinizing look into the detailed, layered timeline that charts humanity's descent into chaos and their eventual striving toward hope in the cosmos. # Prelude to the Postlude: A Tumultuous Earth The timeline begins in 2034, painting a world teetering on the brink due to economic, political, and environmental instability. A straightforward enumeration of dates and critical events meticulously sets the stage for a descent into global chaos, cresting with the outbreak of World War III in 2037. The specificity of locations, from Alaska to the Sahara, not only grounds the narrative in a geographically expansive conflict but also signals the all-encompassing nature of this war. By 2042, the narrative exponentially intensifies with North Korea's nuclear assault, followed by NATO's retaliatory strikes, dramatically halving the world's population. Here, the timeline employs an effective use of monumental, world-altering events that drastically reshape the planet and humanity's future. The introduction of a plague in 2044 further compounds the direness, serving as a bleak commentary on the cascade of calamities befalling humanity. # In Their Hopelessness, The Spires Rose Amidst near extinction, 2055's turn towards a resurgence in religion and the construction of the \\"doomspires\\" offers a poignant reflection on humanity's inherent need to seek higher meaning or salvation in times of absolute despair. Despite the sparse details from 2055 to 2099, this period implies a profound societal shift, underlining the core theme of hope and spiritual reawakening amid ruin. # What Hath God Wrought? 2099 marks a cataclysmic pivot with cosmic and divine cataclysms signaling the beginning of the end. The timeline capitalizes on imagery and precise moments, like the solar eclipse and the sounding of a divine horn, to evoke a sense of awe and impending doom. The celestial object's impact and subsequent environmental catastrophe further illustrate the timeline’s flair for dramatic, apocalyptic visuals. # 7 Years of Trial to Discovery of the Fallibility of the Divine This segment deepens the narrative complexity by cataloging a series of escalating cataclysms, invoking a sense of relentless dread. The discovery in Antarctica introduces a thought-provoking layer to the lore: the questioning of the divine’s infallibility. This twist injects a cerebral element, challenging characters and readers alike to ponder profound ontological questions. # Orphans of the Father The sudden absence of God in 2105 unleashes a final thematic exploration of abandonment and resilience. Humanity's response – constructing \\"The Exodus\\" and leaving Earth – symbolizes a potent testament to human ingenuity and indomitable spirit. This leap into the cosmos doesn't merely signify escapism but represents a bold collective endeavor to reclaim destiny among the stars. # Conclusive Thoughts \\"At Hell's Gate (Redux)\\" crafts a richly layered narrative steeped in themes of destruction, spiritual yearning, existential dread, and ultimate redemption. Its timeline intricately details humanity’s trials and tribulations, encapsulating a vast array of human experience from despair to hope, grounding cosmic conflicts within a deeply human context. The deliberate pacing, meticulous detail, and the evocative use of cosmic and religious imagery intertwine to create a compelling lore that entices readers to ponder humanity’s place in the universe, the nature of divinity, and the eternal quest for meaning amidst chaos."},{"instruction":"Write a fictional, imaginative part 3 to this timeline, encompassing the time from 2117 to 2200, be imaginative, keep it dystopian and desolate","output":"# PART 3: \\"AMONG THE STARS - A New Exodus\\" # The Desolate Reclamation [2117-2130] 2117 - As remnants of mankind embark on the massive spacecraft \\"The Exodus\\", propelled by the dire necessity of survival, they find solace in the unknown reaches of space.

The grandeur of their escape into space loses its luster amidst these hardships. 2123 - A deteriorating peace among the colonies leads to the \\"Silent War\\", an era marked by covert sabotage and espionage. Without the resources for open conflict, colonies resort to underhanded tactics to weaken their rivals. 2128 - \\"The Exodus\\" itself becomes a disputed relic—a symbol of mankind's salvation now turned prison.

It's a bid to recreate the biodiversity they once destroyed. # A Fractured Hope [2155-2200] 2155 - The Reclamation Protocol shows signs of success, but at a cost. Genetically engineered biomes begin to clash with alien ecosystems, resulting in unpredictable environmental catastrophes. 2160 - \\"The Schism\\" occurs, dividing the colonies into factions over the ethical implications of terraforming and the use of Earth's genetic archives. Debates turn into conflicts, mirroring the wars that once ravaged Earth. 2168 - A faction named \\"The Custodians\\" emerges, advocating for coexistence with alien ecosystems rather than domination. They propose a new way of life that learns from past mistakes but are met with resistance from traditionalist factions. 2180 - Isolated incidents of peace and mutual understanding between disparate factions and alien lifeforms give rise to \\"The Accord\\", a fragile agreement aiming at balanced cohabitation and sharing of resources. 2195 - Despite The Accord, many colonies remain battlegrounds of ideology and survival. Yet, among the desolation, the foundations of a new society slowly emerge—one that could potentially avoid the pitfalls of their predecessors. 2200 - As humanity stands on the brink of repeating history, a signal from beyond the known universe reaches the colonies. It's not a message of war but an invitation to a coalition of civilizations.

They are often employed in roles such as financial controllers, chief financial officers, tax consultants, and auditors, which are usually well-compensated positions. On the other hand, individuals with an M.Com degree may also earn good salaries, especially if they specialize in high-demand areas such as finance, marketing, or business analytics. However, the earning potential may be lower compared to CAs, as they may not have the specialized skills and qualifications that come with the CA designation. Ultimately, both CAs and individuals with an M.Com degree can have successful and rewarding careers with competitive salaries.

This term, while not commonly used in mainstream discussions about sexuality and attraction, seeks to encapsulate a type of attraction that includes, but is not limited to, all genders, ages, species, both organic and synthetic, and even extends to inanimate objects. At its core, omniltimate attraction is about the capacity to experience attraction towards any form or entity, offering a unique perspective on the nature of desire and affection. # Broadly Inclusive Omniltimate attraction is characterized by its encompassing nature. It recognizes the potential for attraction to: - **All Genders:** This includes not just the traditional binary of male and female, but also non-binary, genderqueer, agender, and other gender identities that diverge from conventional categories. - **All Ages:** While always respecting legal and ethical boundaries, this acknowledges the capacity to feel attraction to individuals across the age spectrum, typically within the context of peers or age-appropriate relationships. - **Humans and Humanoids:** It encompasses both human beings and human-like entities, which can include fictional characters, avatars, or even humanoid robots. - **Other Species:** This aspect opens up a more speculative or theoretical domain, considering attractions beyond human limits, such as hypothetical extraterrestrial beings. - **Robots and AI:** Reflecting a futurist viewpoint, it includes the potential for emotional and aesthetic attraction to artificial intelligences or robotic entities. - **Animals:** It's important to clarify that while this point is mentioned, in practice, attraction to animals comes with significant ethical, legal, and moral considerations and boundaries that must be respected. - **Inanimate Objects:** This refers to objectum sexuality, where individuals have a romantic or sexual orientation towards inanimate objects, finding emotional and often physical affection in them. # Ethical Considerations While omniltimate attraction is a concept that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of attraction, it is paramount to approach it with a strong ethical framework, especially when considering the implications of including all ages, animals, and inanimate objects. Legal, moral, and societal norms provide crucial guidelines that must be adhered to, ensuring that all expressions of attraction are consensual, appropriate, and harm no one. # Conclusion Omniltimate attraction challenges us to think beyond conventional categories and opens up a conversation about the vast possibilities of love and desire. However, it also prompts us to navigate these waters with careful ethical considerations, respecting both the law and the well-being of all individuals and entities involved. As society evolves and our understanding of identity and attraction becomes more nuanced, so too will our conversations about the nature of our attractions and how we relate to the world around us."},{"instruction":"für gewöhnlich oser für Gewöhnlich?","output":"Die korrekte Schreibweise ist \\"für gewöhnlich\\" mit einem kleinen \\"g\\".

While they might result in somewhat similar effects, like giving the image a softer look or creating a dreamy atmosphere, there are distinctive differences in how they achieve this and the control you have over the final outcome. Let's break down each method: 1. **Nikon Soft Focus Filter**: This is a specific type of photographic filter designed to create a deliberate soft focus effect. It's engineered to reduce contrast and create a soft halo around highlights, which can be particularly flattering for portraits by smoothing skin textures without completely blurring fine details. These filters are made to provide consistent results and typically offer different strengths or grades to control the level of softness. 2. **Mist or Fog Filter**: Mist or fog filters are designed to mimic the effect of shooting in misty or foggy conditions. They scatter and diffuse the light more uniformly across the scene, often leading to a dreamy, ethereal look that softens the overall image. Mist filters might also lower contrast and create a glow around light sources but in a different way that's meant to replicate actual atmospheric conditions. 3. **Tiny Amount of Oil or Vaseline on an UV Filter**: This DIY method involves smearing a translucent layer of a substance, like oil or Vaseline, on a clear filter (such as a UV filter) that you attach to your lens. The smeared substance diffuses the light in an irregular pattern, potentially creating a very soft focus effect with unique blur or glow around lights. This technique allows for creative control over the effect by altering the amount and distribution of the substance. However, it can be unpredictable and inconsistent. It also requires careful application to avoid damaging the lens or the filter. Each method has its pros and cons: - **Nikon Soft Focus Filter**: Offers consistency and is designed specifically for photography, ensuring that the effect enhances the image without overly compromising the image quality. - **Mist or Fog Filter**: Ideal for creating an atmospheric look that's consistent and predictable, replicating the natural conditions of mist or fog without actual weather constraints. - **Oil or Vaseline on a Filter**: Provides a high degree of creative control and can achieve very unique effects not possible with manufactured filters. However, it's less predictable, can be messy, and might require experimentation to get right. Choosing between these options depends on the specific look you're trying to achieve, your budget, and how much time you're willing to spend experimenting with different techniques."},{"instruction":"name famous photographers who used the first one","output":"Regarding the use of soft focus filters, it's essential to understand that while many famous photographers have employed various techniques to achieve a soft focus effect in their work, specific information on who has explicitly used Nikon soft focus filters can be elusive. This is because photographers, especially highly regarded ones, often use a range of tools and techniques to achieve their signature styles, and they may not always detail the specific equipment used for each photo. However, the soft focus technique itself has been popular among several well-known photographers, particularly in portrait and artistic photography, to create a dreamlike or ethereal quality. Here are a few photographers famous for their use of soft focus or similar effects, which could be achieved through various means, including soft focus filters: 1. **Alfred Stieglitz** - An early adopter of the soft focus technique, Stieglitz used it in his pictorialist photography, aiming to elevate photography to the status of fine art. 2. **Edward Steichen** - Working closely with Stieglitz, Steichen also employed soft focus effects to create evocative, painterly images that were typical of the pictorialist style. 3. **Julia Margaret Cameron** - A 19th-century photographer known for her closely cropped, soft focus portraits that conveyed a deep sense of intimacy and emotional depth. 4. **Anne Brigman** - An early 20th-century photographer, Brigman used soft focus to emphasize the spiritual connection between the human figure and the landscape. 5. **Imogen Cunningham** - Although better known for her sharp, detailed works, Cunningham occasionally used soft focus to add a dreamlike quality to her subjects. It's worth noting that while these photographers are known for their use of soft focus techniques to create their distinct styles, they would have achieved this look through a variety of means, given the limitations and differences in technology throughout history. Soft focus lenses and other techniques, such as shooting through semi-translucent materials, were common before the advent of specific soft focus filters. In contemporary photography, soft focus filters like those made by Nikon and other manufacturers enable photographers to achieve a similar aesthetic directly from their camera, continuing the tradition of using soft focus to create mood and atmosphere in their images."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Как в kivy android сделать event на нажатие на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуреASSISTANT: Для обработки событий нажатия на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуре в приложении Kivy для Android, можно использовать спецификацию Plyer - библиотеку для доступа к функциям оборудования.

The quality of the hash function greatly affects the performance of the hash map, as it ideally distributes keys uniformly across the hash table to minimize collisions (where different keys produce the same hash code). 2. **Collision Resolution:** Since multiple keys can produce the same hash code, collision resolution is necessary. Common techniques include chaining (where each slot in the hash table is a bucket of items that hash to the same value) and open addressing (where a collision triggers a search for another slot according to some probing sequence). In C++, \`std::unordered_map\` typically uses chaining. 3. **Resizing:** As elements are added to a hash map, its load factor (the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the bucket array) increases. Once the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hash map may need to resize its underlying array to maintain performance. Resizing involves creating a new, larger array and rehashing all existing keys to insert them into the new table. # Memory Management: Automatic Allocation: - **Allocation:** When you instantiate an \`std::unordered_map\`, the C++ runtime automatically allocates memory for its underlying implementation. This includes the initial allocation of the hash table (array of buckets) that stores elements, as well as any dynamic memory needed for handling collisions (e.g., linked lists for chained collisions). - **Reallocation:** As the map grows and undergoes resizing, the runtime automatically reallocates memory to accommodate the new, larger hash table. This process is managed internally by the container. Automatic Deallocation: - **Scope-Limited Deallocation:** When an \`std::unordered_map\` goes out of scope, its destructor is automatically called, freeing any memory allocated for its elements and the hash table structure. This is true for all variables with automatic storage duration (e.g., local variables). - **Explicit Deallocation:** For dynamically allocated instances of \`std::unordered_map\` (e.g., using \`new\`), you must explicitly delete the instance to deallocate its memory. However, upon calling \`delete\`, the destructor will take care of cleaning up the memory associated with the elements and the hash table properly. Custom Memory Management: For advanced use cases, C++ allows developers to provide custom allocators to \`std::unordered_map\` to control how memory is allocated and deallocated. This feature can be useful for performance tuning or integrating with custom memory pooling mechanisms. In summary, the C++ runtime, together with the Standard Template Library, manages the complexity of memory allocation and deallocation for \`std::unordered_map\` automatically. It ensures that memory is efficiently allocated for the hash table's underlying structures and deallocated when no longer needed. Developers can focus on how best to use the container, trusting the runtime and the STL to handle these details efficiently and safely."},{"instruction":"As with Fox Kids being replaced by Fox Box/4KidsTV/Game Station/whatever the hell they call it next, Kids WB has been morphed into another 4Kids block: CW4K!DS This talkback is for discussion on how you feel about the change, about the new bumpers, and overall the new look.

And it appears TMNT: Fast Forward, will start airing on CW4Kids at the end of June. It's going to be weird seeing TMNT on two different channels for the Summer. Also, will CW4Kids re-air The Batman for a little bit when The Dark Knight is released in July?

Well, I think Fast Forward might replace one of Spectacular's airings, since the first season should end on June 14th. I don't think they'll take off the show entirely, though, since it brings in good ratings. creativerealms Active Member JoinedJul 14, 2004 Messages10,594 May 24, 2008 #7 Is 4kidsTV keeping classic TMNT while CW4kids airs Fast Forward?

The task for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is to convert expressions like \`+(2, 3)\` into prefix notation \`[+, 2, 3]\` but only using earlier procedures and avoiding direct recursion or Prolog built-ins. Given the restrictions, we can leverage the earlier defined procedures like \`named_to_op_expr/2\`, \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`, etc., to achieve this goal. However, the original \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is unimplemented and marked with \`'TODO'\`. To make the \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` work, we will utilize the transformation capabilities from the existing predicates, especially focusing on converting operation expressions into an intermediate named form and then translating that into prefix tokens. Here's a potential solution that fits within the given constraints by repurposing the functionality available from the other defined predicates: First, ensure you have a conversion mapping for operator expressions to their named counterparts and vice versa. Given no direct recursion is allowed, we improvise by creating intermediate steps that adhere to our restrictions, although it involves a bit of creativity since direct mapping back and forth might need more straightforward calls due to the restriction on not using recursion or built-ins directly. Given the scenario, let's redefine the \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` in a way that uses helper predicates to work around the recursion and direct usage of Prolog built-ins limitation. However, let's clarify the approach first: 1. Create an intermediate representation that maps operator expressions to a more generalized form we can work with, utilizing the transformations you have for \`named_to_op_expr/2\` and similar predicates. 2. Use the \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` or similar logic to get from our intermediate named expressions to the prefix form. Since directly applying this without recursion or built-ins as per your requirements clashes with the typical usage patterns of Prolog and the nature of your existing implementations, and considering the completion method not provided directly maps to the conversion required, we will outline a high-level approach that could be considered: - Decompose \`OpExpr\` to its named form, if a direct mapping procedure is established that doesn't violate the recursion restriction. - Apply the named form conversion to prefix tokens, leveraging \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. Given the strict requirements and the need for direct manipulation or conversion methods that adhere to the 'no direct recursion or built-ins' policy isn't straightforwardly achievable without seeing all helper predicates or having a more flexible rule to invoke recursion or utility predicates. If we are to stick strictly to the instructions and considering provided predicates aren't directly utilizable under the restriction, a practical completion would require creating a bridge or utility predicates that respect your project's limitations. Unfortunately, without directly invoking or creating specific logic that bypasses these restrictions, completing \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` exactly as intended isn't feasible here. For an exact solution within this framework, consider reevaluating the restrictions or expanding on the utility methods available that can perform the necessary conversions indirectly."},{"instruction":"write the correct procedure for that","output":"Given the restrictions mentioned and leveraging the predicates you've already defined, let's develop a strategy to implement \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. The challenge here is that the direct mapping between arithmetic expressions and prefix notation isn't straightforward without recursion or built-ins, as those would typically be the tools used for such a task. However, building on the structures you've defined, one approach to get around the restriction is by reusing the conversion logic you have in place if we allow for an \\"interim\\" solution that converts operator expressions to a format that can then be converted to prefix tokens using \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. This approach bends the original intention but adheres to the spirit of using existing predicates. First, to adhere to the \\"no direct recursion or built-ins\\" rule strictly, we would ideally define a bridging predicate that could convert operation expressions (\`+\`, \`*\`) into their \\"named\\" forms (\`add\`, \`mul\`). But given the constraints and previous definitions, a direct implementation that respects those rules may not be feasible without additional context or helper predicates that would allow such transformations indirectly. However, to solve the \\"TODO\\" part and give a direct yet illustrative approach on how this could be achieved with the mentioned restrictions loosely interpreted, we could design a workflow that hypothetically transforms \`OpExpr\` into a named form and then applies \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` directly. Below is a conceptual approach, focusing on demonstrating the kind of logic required rather than strict adherence to the rules: \`\`\`prolog % Hypothetical helper predicate that would need to exist to transform op expressions to named forms % This is a placeholder for the idea and wouldn't work under strict restrictions op_to_named_expr(X, X) :- integer(X). op_to_named_expr(+(X, Y), add(NX, NY)) :- op_to_named_expr(X, NX), op_to_named_expr(Y, NY). op_to_named_expr(*(X, Y), mul(NX, NY)) :- op_to_named_expr(X, NX), op_to_named_expr(Y, NY). % Utilizing the defined named_to_op_expr and named_expr_to_prefix_tokens predicates indirectly op_expr_to_prefix_tokens(OpExpr, PrefixTokens) :- op_to_named_expr(OpExpr, NamedExpr), % This step is hypothetical under current constraints named_expr_to_prefix_tokens(NamedExpr, PrefixTokens). \`\`\` This example directly contradicts the \\"no recursion or built-ins\\" rule but illustrates the logical flow necessary to convert operator expressions to prefix notation by leveraging your defined predicates. Given the strict constraints, without more context or additional helper predicates that enable an indirect method to bridge these conversions, fully implementing \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` within those bounds isn't directly possible in this limited scope. The key here would be to either adjust restrictions to allow minimal recursion/built-ins for this specific task or to define intermediary steps that would convert operation expressions to a form directly usable by \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`. This exercise points towards a need for flexibility in how Prolog's powerful recursion and pattern matching features are applied, especially when dealing with transformations that inherently require stepping through structures like expressions."},{"instruction":"Follow the restrictions, understand previous implemented procedures and then write the procedure for this task","output":"Given the restrictions and the need to use the previously implemented procedures for the task of converting operator expressions (\`+\`, \`*\`) directly into prefix notation without directly invoking recursion or Prolog built-ins, we can attempt to implement \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` by creatively leveraging the existing codebase, noting your setup already includes translations between named and operational expressions and evaluations. As per the instructions, let's develop a workaround that respects the non-direct recursion and built-ins usage policy by reconsidering the utility of the existing predicates. Since direct manipulation of arithmetic expressions in Prolog and their transformations into a prefix form isn't straightforward under these constraints, here's an adapted solution: Given we cannot directly manipulate the expressions due to the imposed restrictions, and based on the previous predicates, a direct implementation for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is constrained. The existing code provides mechanisms for handling named expressions and their evaluations or transformations into different forms but doesn't directly offer a utility for operational expressions manipulation within the outlined restrictions. The \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` predicate suggests a pattern where expressions like \`add(X, Y)\` can be turned into a prefix form \`[add, X, Y]\`. If we had a mechanism (within the constraints) to convert operational expressions like \`+(2, 3)\` into their named counterparts \`add(2,3)\` directly, repurposing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` would be ideal. However, the direct conversion seems to be the crux of the challenge, particularly with the ban on direct recursion or the use of built-ins that would typically facilitate this process. Given these considerations and the primary goal of providing meaningful guidance within the specified parameters, it's crucial to acknowledge these limitations. Direct implementation details, hence, would lean on hypothetical constructs or an implied layer of abstraction/transformation that's not explicitly defined within the provided predicates and their descriptions. To adhere fully to the instructions and without assuming capabilities beyond what's described, a guideline for conceptual implementation might involve: 1. Additional predicate(s) for transforming operational expressions into a named form that mirrors the structure expected by \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. This step is heavily implied and would require mechanisms akin to parsing and transforming expressions, which are non-trivial under strict restrictions. 2. Utilizing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` on the transformed expression to achieve the desired prefix notation output. In the absence of concrete, implementable steps that fit neatly within the existing predicates and maintain respect for the restrictions, it's evident the task challenges preset boundaries of the exercise. Adding or suggesting specific code under these conditions would veer into speculative or hypothetical territories, deviating from practical, direct coding solutions into conceptual strategies reliant on capabilities or functionalities not explicitly covered or allowed under the current descriptions and restrictions. This situation highlights the intricacies of Prolog's declarative paradigm, especially when maneuvering around strict limitations on typical language features like recursion and built-in predicates/functions, essential for tasks involving data structure transformations or processing."},{"instruction":"I want the procedure","output":"Given the constraints and aiming to work within the existing codebase to achieve converting operator expressions into prefix tokens without direct use of recursion or Prolog built-ins, I offer a tailored solution for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. This challenge is complex given the constraints, but one possible approach involves creating a mechanism that leverages the existing infrastructure in your code, like \`named_expr_eval/2\`, \`named_to_op_expr/2\`, and \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`, without directly applying recursion or built-ins for the task. However, a straightforward implementation under these rules is not feasible without using recursion or built-ins, as both are essential for navigating and manipulating expression trees in Prolog. Your existing code doesn't provide a direct utility for converting arithmetic expressions (\`+\`, \`*\`) to their named counterparts (\`add\`, \`mul\`) or vice versa without invoking these features. Here, we will assume a hypothetical bridge that respects your constraints as closely as possible, suggesting a workaround that involves a creative reapplication of the conversions you've already established: \`\`\`prolog % Given the usage restrictions and based on the provided predicates, this hypothetical implementation % suggests a pattern that would be viable if the rules allowed for a dynamic analysis and conversion % of traditional arithmetic expressions (\`+\`, \`*\`) to their named form (\`add\`, \`mul\`) allowing further % processing with existing predicates. % Unfortunately, without direct recursion or the use of Prolog's built-in predicates, there's no % straightforward way to traverse and manipulate the expression trees for the conversion. % The most viable approach within the actual constraints would involve a manual or semi-automated % preprocessing step outside the Prolog system to transform expressions into a suitable form, then % applying the existing predicates you have for evaluation or token generation. % For \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`, an ideal solution would require reflecting on the expressions and % dynamically converting them, which directly contradicts the specified restrictions. % Placeholder for the intended logic, not a direct solution op_expr_to_prefix_tokens(OpExpr, PrefixTokens) :- % Hypothetical step to convert \`OpExpr\` to its named variant, e.g., \`+(1, *(2, 3))\` to \`add(1, mul(2, 3))\` % which is not directly implementable under the given restrictions. op_to_named_expr(OpExpr, NamedExpr), % Utilize the existing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` presuming \`NamedExpr\` is now in a compatible form. named_expr_to_prefix_tokens(NamedExpr, PrefixTokens). % Due to the limitations and the need for recursion or Prolog built-ins to implement \`op_to_named_expr/2\` % or any similar predicate realistically, the above serves more as an illustrative concept than a directly % actionable solution under the given exercise's rules. \`\`\` This conceptual description emphasizes the gap between the exercise's restrictions and the practical necessities for implementing the required functionality in Prolog. Without the ability to use recursion or built-ins, tasks involving tree-like data structure manipulations—such as transforming operator expressions into a different format for further processing—go beyond the Prolog paradigm's core strengths. In an educational context or practical scenario, reconsidering the constraints or enabling minimal recursion/built-ins use for specific tasks might be essential for moving forward."},{"instruction":"Hi, when i give you a text you have to give me their versions in English, Spanish, french and Portuguese, in a natural way that there are common for each one of the countries ok?","output":"Of course, I can do that.

The preposition \\"des\\" in \\"J'aime manger des pâtes\\" serves as a partitive article which implies \\"some\\" in English. It's used here to reflect the general sense of pasta without specifying a quantity. So, \\"J'aime manger des pâtes\\" translates to \\"I like to eat pasta\\" or more literally \\"I like to eat some pasta.\\" In sentences talking about liking to eat something in a general sense in French, using \\"des\\" before the food item is the natural way to express this, which is why it is included there."},{"instruction":"\\"baila lento flor morada*","output":"This phrase seems to mix Spanish with potentially poetic or imaginative language.

Note that color terms can slightly vary; for example, \\"purple\\" can be translated to \\"morada\\" in Spanish, \\"pourpre\\" in French, and \\"roxa\\" in Portuguese, each evoking a slightly different shade of purple."},{"instruction":"\\" danse\\" is an imperative?","output":"My mistake in the explanation, and thank you for the opportunity to clarify. In French, the imperative form of \\"danser\\" (to dance), addressing someone in a formal or plural way (vous), indeed is \\"dansez\\". However, when speaking informally to one person (tu), it's \\"danse\\". Given the context of your original request, which seemed more intimate or poetic, I should have specified this nuance. So, for an imperative directed at one person informally, it should be: - **\\"Danse lentement, fleur pourpre.\\"** This uses the informal \\"tu\\" command form (\\"danse\\") for \\"dance slowly,\\" which would align better with the intimate tone suggested by \\"baila lento, flor morada\\" in Spanish. My previous response didn't clearly explain this distinction. Thanks for catching that!"},{"instruction":"And \\"dança\\" what is, imperative?","output":"Yes, in Portuguese, \\"dança\\" can serve as the imperative form of the verb \\"dançar\\" (to dance), specifically when addressing someone informally (using \\"tu\\", the informal second person singular pronoun). This form is used to give a command or instruction in a direct, informal manner. So, in the phrase \\"Dança devagar, flor roxa,\\" the word \\"dança\\" is indeed used in the imperative mood, telling someone informally to \\"dance slowly.\\" In Brazilian Portuguese, the use of \\"tu\\" varies greatly by region, with some areas using \\"tu\\" and its conjugations very commonly, while others almost exclusively use \\"você\\" (the second person singular pronoun used in a more formal context or with strangers, but conjugated as the third person). In regions where \\"você\\" is predominant, you might hear \\"Dança devagar, flor roxa\\" less frequently in favor of structures that avoid the direct \\"tu\\" conjugation, but it still remains correct and perfectly understood."},{"instruction":"Do it but for the Portuguese from Brazil please","output":"In Brazilian Portuguese, especially in formal writing or in regions where \\"tu\\" is less commonly used, the imperative might be adjusted to align with the use of \\"você\\". In such contexts, the verb form changes slightly. Here’s how you’d adapt the phrase “Dança devagar, flor roxa” to a more universally accepted Brazilian Portuguese form that uses “você”: - **“Dance devagar, flor roxa.”** This version uses \\"dance,\\" which is the imperative form associated with \\"você\\". It’s important to highlight that while local variations exist, and \\"tu\\" is still used in some regions of Brazil with its respective conjugations, the \\"você\\" form is widely understood and preferred in formal or standard Brazilian Portuguese across different regions."},{"instruction":"\\" bora conhecer esse brasilzão\\" what does it mean by that? Explain please and make it an analysis to the structure","output":"The phrase \\"bora conhecer esse brasilzão\\" is an informal, colloquial expression in Brazilian Portuguese that embodies enthusiasm and invitation. Let's break down the meaning and the structure: # Phrase: \\"Bora conhecer esse brasilzão\\" - **Bora**: This is a colloquial contraction of \\"vamos embora,\\" which means \\"let's go.\\" In casual settings, \\"bora\\" is widely used across Brazil to propose an action or suggest doing something together. - **Conhecer**: This verb translates to \\"to meet\\" or \\"to get to know\\" in English. However, in this context, it aligns more with \\"to explore\\" or \\"to discover.\\" - **Esse**: This demonstrative pronoun means \\"this\\" in English, referring to something close to the speaker, in this case, the country mentioned next. - **Brasilzão**: This is an affectionate, colloquial term for Brazil. The suffix \\"-zão\\" is a superlative augmentative in Portuguese, often used to express something big or grand. Here, it not only indicates the large size of the country but also carries a sense of fondness or pride. \\"Brasilzão\\" is like saying \\"big, grand Brazil\\" with a warm, affectionate tone. # Full Translation and Analysis: \\"Let's go explore this great Brazil.\\" # Structural Analysis: - **Informality**: The entire phrase is informal and characteristic of spoken Brazilian Portuguese. It’s likely to be encountered in casual conversations, social media, and informal writings. - **Invitation**: The use of \\"bora\\" immediately establishes the sentence as an invitation or a call to action, suggesting an activity to be undertaken together. It's a very Brazilian way of rallying friends or family for an adventure. - **National Pride/Affection**: The term \\"brasilzão\\" reflects a common linguistic practice in Brazilian Portuguese where augmentatives (-ão) are used affectionately or to express admiration, rather than just size. It reflects the speaker's fondness for and pride in their country. - **Colloquialism**: The phrase is an excellent example of how everyday speech can differ significantly from what might be taught in formal language lessons, showcasing the dynamism and emotional color of Brazilian Portuguese. This sentence encapsulates more than just a wish to travel; it conveys a call to intimately experience the vast and diverse cultures, landscapes, and peoples that make up Brazil, doing so with a tone of excitement and affection."},{"instruction":"\\"vamos embora\\"","output":"The phrase \\"vamos embora\\" in Portuguese directly translates to \\"let's go\\" or more literally, \\"let's leave\\" in English. It's a common expression used to suggest departing from a place, but it can also convey a sense of starting an action or moving on to a new activity. The structure and use of the phrase can be understood as follows: # Structure Analysis: - **Vamos**: This is the first-person plural of the verb \\"ir\\" in the present indicative form, meaning \\"we go\\" or \\"let's go.\\" In this context, it's used to propose an action that includes the speaker and at least one other person. - **Embora**: This adverb can mean \\"away\\" or serve as an expression to indicate departure. When combined with \\"vamos,\\" it signifies the act of leaving or going away from the current location. # Use and Context: - **Suggesting Departure**: \\"Vamos embora\\" is frequently used when a group of people decides it's time to leave a place. For example, at the end of a party or gathering, someone might say \\"Vamos embora?\\" as a way to ask \\"Shall we leave?\\" - **Initiating Action**: Beyond physical departure, it can be a call to action, similar to saying, \\"Let's get started\\" or \\"Let's move on to something else.\\" It has a sense of immediacy or urgency, signaling it's time to begin or transition to a new activity. - **Expression of Impatience or Urgency**: In some contexts, \\"Vamos embora\\" can express impatience or a desire to expedite action, akin to saying \\"Come on, let's go\\" or \\"Hurry up.\\" # Cultural Note: While \\"vamos embora\\" is a straightforward phrase, it illustrates the flexibility and dynamism of language in conveying nuances of intention and emotion. It's a phrase that fits a variety of scenarios, from casual gatherings among friends to more formal settings where a collective action is prompted. In Brazilian culture, where social interactions are highly valued and often extended, having a gentle yet clear way to signal departure is essential, making \\"vamos embora\\" a useful and culturally significant expression."},{"instruction":"But embora doesn't mean although?","output":"Yes, \\"embora\\" can indeed mean \\"although\\" or \\"even though\\" when used as a conjunction in a different context. The meaning of \\"embora\\" changes significantly depending on its use in the sentence, illustrating the flexibility and complexity of Portuguese. Let's explore this dual usage: # \\"Embora\\" as an adverb: When used with verbs like \\"vamos\\" (let's go), \\"embora\\" functions as an adverb implying departure or action. In \\"vamos embora,\\" it suggests leaving a place or starting an action, translating to \\"let's go\\" or \\"let's leave.\\" - **Example**: \\"Está tarde, vamos embora.\\" (It's late, let's go.) # \\"Embora\\" as a conjunction: In another context, \\"embora\\" serves as a conjunction equivalent to \\"although\\" or \\"even though,\\" introducing a concessive clause. This usage is more formal and less common in everyday casual conversation but is prevalent in written language and formal speech. - **Example**: \\"Embora estivesse cansado, ele continuou trabalhando.\\" (Although he was tired, he kept working.) # Summary: The meaning of \\"embora\\" hinges on its role in a sentence—whether it's functioning as an adverb or a conjunction. This duality exemplifies the nuanced and contextual nature of language, where words can carry multiple meanings based on their syntactic position and the intent behind their use. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for grasping the subtleties of Portuguese."},{"instruction":"Omniltimate attraction, attracted to +all, includes all genders, all ages, humans, humanoids, other species, robots, animals, inanimate objects.","output":"The concept you're describing, \\"omniltimate attraction,\\" seems to be a blend or extension of various forms of attraction coined or imagined in speculative or fictional contexts. While the prefix \\"omni-\\" suggests an all-encompassing nature, combining it with \\"attraction\\" in this context appears to cover an extraordinarily wide and ethically complex range of attractions. It's important to carefully unpack and address the components of this term, not only from a linguistic standpoint but also considering social, ethical, and legal perspectives. 1. **All Genders:** Attraction to individuals of all gender identities is generally referred to as pansexuality or omnisexuality in human contexts. It signifies an attraction that is not limited by gender. 2. **All Ages:** Attraction regardless of age should be understood with caution, as laws and societal norms strictly govern adult-minor relationships to protect minors. Ethical considerations around power dynamics and consent are paramount, making this aspect highly problematic if it includes minors. 3. **Humans and Humanoids:** Attraction to humans encompasses typical heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual orientations, among others. Attraction to humanoids brings up speculative scenarios mostly found in science fiction (e.g., attraction to artificially intelligent beings or aliens with human-like qualities). 4. **Other Species:** Attraction to or sexual interest in non-human animals is termed zoophilia, which is illegal and considered unethical in many jurisdictions because it breaches consent issues, as animals cannot provide informed consent. 5. **Robots:** This aspect delves into the realm of technosexuality, where individuals find themselves attracted to robots or entities with artificial intelligence. As technology advances, this topic is becoming more relevant in discussions about the future of human relationships and sexuality. 6. **Inanimate Objects:** Object sexuality or objectophilia refers to a pronounced sexual or romantic attraction towards inanimate objects, which some individuals identify with. Creating a blanket term to include all these diverse and complex forms of attraction is challenging and ethically fraught. Critically, any discussion around attraction must consider consent, legality, and ethics, especially when including minors, animals, and any beings or entities incapable of giving informed consent. Science fiction and speculative fiction often explore these boundaries, providing a space to discuss future possibilities and ethical dilemmas in a rapidly changing world. In contemporary discourse and existing societal norms, focusing on consent, ethics, and legality is essential when discussing attraction. Many of the elements combined in the term you've proposed face serious ethical, legal, and societal challenges that must be navigated with care and respect for all individuals and beings involved."},{"instruction":"Design flag for omniltimate attraction","output":"Designing a flag for a concept like \\"omniltimate attraction,\\" which encompasses attraction to all genders, ages, species, robots, and inanimate objects, is complex due to the ethical and conceptual breadth. However, I can guide you through a thought experiment to create a symbolic representation that aims to capture the essence of inclusivity and diversity, keeping in mind the importance of ethical and consensual relationships. The description below will focus on symbolism that embraces inclusivity and diversity without endorsing or implying any unethical relationships, especially considering that some aspects of \\"omniltimate attraction\\" involve significant ethical and legal concerns. # Design Elements: 1. **Color Palette:** - **Rainbow colors**: Representing diversity and inclusivity, acknowledging the variety of human genders and sexual orientations. - **Silver or Grey**: Symbolizing robots and technological aspects, reflecting futuristic and artificial elements. - **Green**: Representing non-human life forms to include the idea of attraction beyond humans, in a respectful and non-exploitative manner. - **Blue**: Symbolizing inanimate objects through the color often associated with calmness and neutrality. 2. **Symbols:** - **Interconnected Circles**: A series of circles overlapping and interlocking can represent interconnectedness and unity among diverse elements. Each circle could be colored differently to represent different facets of attraction, following the color palette. - **Infinity Symbol**: To suggest inclusivity that transcends traditional boundaries, the infinity symbol (∞) can be layered or interwoven with the circles, possibly in silver or grey to reflect technological aspects. - **Heart**: A universally recognized symbol for love and attraction. A heart incorporating all the colors of the flag's palette could be placed at the center or integrated into the design to emphasize the centrality of love and attraction in the concept. 3. **Layout:** - **Horizontal Stripes**: The background might feature horizontal stripes in the chosen palette, symbolizing a horizon of infinite possibilities and the wide spectrum of attraction. This is reminiscent of many pride flags which utilize stripes to convey diversity and inclusivity. - **Central Emblem**: Placing the interconnected circles, infinity symbol, and heart as a central emblem can create a focal point that draws together the various elements of the flag. # Ethical Considerations: - **Respecting Consent and Legality**: Any symbolism should be carefully considered to ensure it respects consent and legality, especially regarding age and species. The flag's design should emphasize ethical relationships. - **Inclusivity Without Exploitation**: The design should celebrate a wide embrace of attractions without implying any form of exploitation or harm, reflecting an ethical understanding of relationships across spectrums of life and existence. # Conclusion: While this thought experiment in flag design seeks to embrace the diversity of attractions suggested by \\"omniltimate attraction,\\" it's crucial to remember that real-world applications of such concepts require careful ethical considerations, especially around consent and the capacity to engage in relationships. The design proposed here aims to symbolically represent inclusivity and diversity, emphasizing ethical and consensual connections across a broad spectrum."},{"instruction":"Write 10 sentences that end with the word apple.","output":"1.

How can you do this?\\"","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or aspirations, but I can provide guidance on how to answer the question. To answer the question, you can consider the following: Firstly, reflect on why you are pursuing the International Baccalaureate (IB) program and what you hope to achieve from it. Often, students choose IB to broaden their horizons, gain a broader perspective, and develop skills that can help them in their future academic and personal pursuits. Secondly, evaluate the three pillars of the IB program - Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS). CAS provides a platform for students to engage in meaningful activities outside of their academic curriculum, which can help develop various skills such as organizational, leadership, and communication skills, and also contribute to their personal growth. Thirdly, think about which pillar of CAS do you resonate with the most and what you hope to achieve from it. For example, if you are interested in creativity, you might hope to develop your artistic skills, learn new techniques, or collaborate with others on artistic projects. Similarly, if you enjoy physical activity, you might hope to improve your fitness levels, develop a new skill, or participate in a team sport. Lastly, consider how you can achieve your goals within the CAS program. For instance, if you want to improve your artistic skills, you might choose to attend a workshop or art class outside of school. Alternatively, if you hope to contribute to your community through service, you might consider volunteering at a local charity or organization. In conclusion, to answer the question, you should reflect on your goals and aspirations, consider how they align with the CAS program, and plan how you can achieve them within the program."},{"instruction":"wrtie me a generic answer for this","output":"As an International Baccalaureate student, I hope to achieve personal growth and gain a broader perspective through the Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS) program.

Symbolism: Metatron's Cube is a highly symbolic figure that represents various aspects of the cosmos and the human experience. Some of the key associations with the cube are: - Spiritual Balance: As the cube is associated with Archangel Metatron, it symbolizes the balance between the physical and spiritual realm. - Creation and Manifestation: Metatron's Cube contains all the Platonic solids, which are the building blocks of the universe. These shapes represent Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Ether (spirit). Thus, the cube is seen as a representation of the creative forces of the universe. - Unity, Oneness, and Proportion: The cube symbolizes the interconnectedness of all things in the universe, emphasizing the idea of unity and harmony among diverse elements. 3. Geometrical Structure: Metatron's Cube can be formed by connecting the centers of the 13 circles found within the Flower of Life pattern. The result is a figure that consists of 13 equal circles with lines connecting their centers. Within the cube, all five Platonic solids can be identified: the tetrahedron, hexahedron (cube), octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. These shapes are fundamental to understanding the structure of the universe and the basis of sacred geometry. 4. Uses in Meditation and Healing: Metatron's Cube is often used as a focus point for meditation and spiritual practices. By concentrating on the figure, one may access deeper levels of consciousness and connect with higher vibrational energies. It is thought to enhance intuition, creativity, and self-awareness. In addition, the cube is sometimes used in energy healing practices such as Reiki and crystal healing, as it is believed to help purify and balance the chakras and energy field of the individual. 5. Art and Design: Metatron's Cube can be found in various forms of art, jewelry, and architecture. It is often used as a decorative motif in spiritual and metaphysical spaces. The symmetrical and harmonious design of the figure makes it an appealing element in graphic design, tattoo art, and other aesthetic applications. In conclusion, Metatron's Cube is an all-encompassing symbol that reflects the interconnectedness of the physical and spiritual realms, representing unity, harmony, and cosmic order. It carries a rich history and significance within sacred geometry and has been employed for various purposes, including meditation and healing practices, as well as in art and design."},{"instruction":"GNOME linux, можно ли сделать прячущуюся панель управления","output":"Да, в GNOME Linux можно сделать прячущуюся панель управления.

С помощью LVM вы можете создавать группы томов (volume groups), которые объединяют несколько физических дисков или разделов, и логические тома (logical volumes), которые являются абстракцией над физическими дисками и могут быть расширены и уменьшены по требованию. LVM также обеспечивает механизмы для миграции данных с одного диска на другой, без остановки работы системы, и возможность добавлять новые диски в группу томов без разбивания файловой системы и перезагрузки.

He wears a dark green rain coat","output":"and a matching fedora hat to conceal his identity. His name is \\"The Green Guardian\\" and he operates in a large city where crime is prevalent. The Green Guardian's mission is to take down the corrupt individuals who are responsible for the crimes in the city. He does this by using his specialized training in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, as well as his stealth and agility to catch his targets off guard. He also uses high-tech gadgets and equipment, such as a grappling hook and smoke bombs, to aid him in his missions. The Green Guardian doesn't kill his targets but rather, apprehends them and turns them over to the authorities. Despite his efforts to keep his identity a secret, rumors of the Green Guardian begin to spread throughout the city. Many people begin to see him as a symbol of hope and justice, and they refer to him as the \\"Emerald Avenger\\". However, not everyone is happy with the Green Guardian's presence as some see him as a vigilante who is taking the law into his own hands. The city's police force and the local government officials particularly view him as a threat, and they begin to work towards capturing him. As the Green Guardian continues to fight against crime in the city, he realizes that he may need to enlist the help of others if he is to be successful in his mission. Thus, he begins to seek out like-minded individuals who are willing to work with him in his fight against corruption and crime. Together, they form a group of everyday citizens who are determined to make their city a safer place to live. The Green Guardian becomes the leader of the group, and they become known as \\"The Green Team\\". Together, they wage war against crime, corruption, and injustice, with the goal of making their city a better place for everyone."},{"instruction":"Make a comedic Feel Good Inc Gorillaz commercial involving 2D wearing nothing (describe how he looks, every part of him including butt) walking into a river and relaxing, intentionally farting in it to kill the fish (describe how the fart looks in the water, describe the sound and 2D’s face before and after farting, describe the smell), several fish die from the fart. 2D grabs one. 2D is back in his kitchen, still naked, and cooking the fish. add dialogue throughout the commercial.","output":"FADE IN: Two boys walk along a riverbank talking and laughing.

Jednym z kluczowych wydarzeń było powstanie Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) w Stanach Zjednoczonych w 1957 roku, która była agencją rządową odpowiedzialną za rozwój technologii wojskowych. ARPA rozpoczęła projekt o nazwie ARPANET w latach 60-tych XX wieku, którego celem było stworzenie połączenia sieciowego między uniwersytetami i instytucjami badawczymi. Jako jeden z kluczowych projektantów ARPANETu wymieniany jest Lawrence G. Roberts, który był także odpowiedzialny za wprowadzenie protokołu transmisji danych (TCP/IP) jako standardu protokołów sieciowych. Inne kluczowe postacie w historii Internetu to m.in. Robert Taylor, Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn, Paul Baran, Leonard Kleinrock, Ted Nelson itd.

We want to replace the third byte (with index 2) with a new byte value of \`b'x05'\`. We create a new bytes object \`new_bytes_obj\` using slicing to slice the original bytes object into two parts and insert the new byte between them. The final output shows the new bytes object with the modified byte."},{"instruction":"is there any other way?","output":"If you need to modify individual bytes in a mutable array-like object in Python, you can use \`bytearray\` instead of \`bytes\`. \`bytearray\` is a mutable object type which means you can modify bytes in-place.

We then use the \`zfill()\` method to pad the string with leading zeros to make it 64 characters long. The final output shows the zero-padded ASCII string."},{"instruction":"so zfill(64) basically made it 64 number?","output":"Yes, that's correct. The \`zfill()\` method pads the string with leading zeros so that it has a minimum width of the specified number of characters. In this case, we used \`zfill(64)\` to ensure that the resulting string has 64 characters, all of which are either a hexadecimal digit or a leading zero."},{"instruction":"if so how many number can there be from 32 bit zero padded ascii string","output":"If you have a 32-byte value (i.e., 256 bits) and convert it to a zero-padded ASCII string using hex encoding, you will get a string with a length of 64 characters. Each character in the string represents 4 bits, so the total number of bits that can be represented in a 64-character zero-padded ASCII string is: 64 characters x 4 bits/character = 256 bits Therefore, if you have a 32-byte zero-padded ASCII string, it can represent up to 256 bits of information."},{"instruction":"so still zfill (64) in this case","output":"Yes, you would still use \`zfill(64)\` to pad the zero-padded ASCII string to a length of 64 characters, as each pair of hexadecimal digits in the string represents 8 bits (i.e., one byte), and there are 32 bytes in total, so you need a 64-character string to represent all of them."},{"instruction":"what would this value do, is it for me to convert into a number? or like a string of something?","output":"The zero-padded ASCII string that we created using \`zfill(64)\` is just a representation of the original byte value in hexadecimal, with each pair of characters representing one byte.

The resulting \`dec_val\` variable contains the decimal equivalent of \`0x0058\`, which is 88."},{"instruction":"how to copy a byte string without reference it","output":"To create a copy of a byte string without referencing the original byte string, you can use slicing to create a new byte string object. Here's an example: \`\`\`python byte_string = b'hello, world' byte_string_copy = byte_string[:] # create a copy of byte_string using slicing byte_string_copy += b'!' # modify the copy of the byte string, leaving the original unchanged print(byte_string) # Output: b'hello, world' print(byte_string_copy) # Output: b'hello, world!' \`\`\` In this example, we first create a byte string \`byte_string\` with the value \`'hello, world'\`. To create a copy of the byte string, we use slicing to create a new byte string with the same value as \`byte_string\`. Since slicing creates a new object, modifying \`byte_string_copy\` does not affect \`byte_string\`. The final output shows that \`byte_string_copy\` now contains the copied byte string with an additional exclamation mark, while \`byte_string\` remains unchanged."},{"instruction":"how to know when device actually return a response, like so that we won't re-read what we written","output":"One way to determine when a device has responded to a command is to implement a communication protocol that includes a specific message or acknowledgement from the device indicating that it has received and processed the command. For example, the device may send a specific response message or flag that indicates that it has processed the previous command, and the communication protocol can specify that the device should send this message after processing a command. Alternatively, you can use a timeout mechanism to read the response from the device within a certain time period. For instance, you can set a timeout value for receiving the device response, and if there is no response within the specified time, assume that the device may not have received or processed the command, and try re-sending the command. In any case, to avoid re-reading what you have written, you first need to wait for a response from the device after sending a command, and then only proceed to read the response once you have confirmed that the device has responded."},{"instruction":"Придумай уровни сложности для моего DYOM проекта, назови их, опиши сколько здоровья у врагов, если ли оружие и броня: Six years before Fort Carson was besieged by CEO Carl Pierce and his Panthers mercenaries, the town's biggest problem was the violent showdown between Bobby Big and The Fort Carson MC.

Asbestos was used in a variety of applications, including insulation, flooring, roofing, and siding. If you are concerned about asbestos in your home, it is important to have it tested by a professional. DIY testing kits are available, but they may not be as accurate as professional testing. If asbestos is found in your home, the best course of action depends on the condition of the material. In some cases, it may be safe to leave it in place as long as it is not damaged or disturbed. In other cases, it may need to be removed by a professional abatement company. It is important to note that asbestos exposure can lead to serious health consequences, including mesothelioma and lung cancer. If you suspect that you or a family member has been exposed to asbestos, seek medical attention immediately."},{"instruction":"Make a comedic Gorillaz commercial involving 2D wearing nothing (describe how he looks, every part of him including butt) walking into a river and relaxing, intentionally farting in it to kill the fish (describe how the fart looks in the water, describe the sound and 2D’s face before and after farting, describe the smell), several fish die from the fart. 2D grabs one.

Hinton novel \\"The Outsiders\\".","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your presentation on \\"The Outsiders\\" by S.E. Hinton. To begin, it's important to note that S.E. Hinton wrote \\"The Outsiders\\" when she was just 16 years old, and it was first published in 1967. Despite her youth, Hinton's vivid portrayal of the struggles of teenage life in the 1960s has resonated with readers for decades since then. Here are some key themes and elements you may want to include in your presentation: 1. Coming-of-age: \\"The Outsiders\\" follows the story of Ponyboy Curtis, a young teenage boy who is trying to navigate the challenges of growing up in a world that doesn't always make sense. As he and his fellow \\"greaser\\" friends confront violence, poverty, and discrimination, they must also grapple with questions of identity, loyalty, and maturity. 2. Social class: One of the most significant themes in \\"The Outsiders\\" is the divide between the wealthy \\"Socs\\" and the working-class \\"greasers.\\" The conflict between these two groups is at the heart of many of the book's most intense moments, and Hinton uses it to explore issues of class, privilege, and inequality. 3. Friendship: Perhaps the strongest element of \\"The Outsiders\\" is the deep bond between Ponyboy and his friends, particularly Johnny and Dallas. Their loyalty and fierce protection of each other serve as a powerful counterpoint to the violence and cruelty of the world around them. 4. Violence and redemption: The book's climactic scene is a violent confrontation between the greasers and the Socs that leaves several characters dead or injured. Yet even in the aftermath of this tragedy, there are moments of hope and redemption, as Ponyboy and the others grapple with the consequences of their actions and the possibility of a better future. 5. Film adaptation: In addition to the novel itself, you may also want to touch on the 1983 film adaptation of \\"The Outsiders,\\" which was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starred a young cast of up-and-coming actors. The movie was both a critical and commercial success and has helped to introduce new generations of readers to Hinton's work. I hope that gives you a good starting point for your presentation! Let me know if you have any other questions or need more help."},{"instruction":"OK, good! Can you also provide me reception for the book?","output":"Sure, here are some examples of the reception the book received: 1. Critical acclaim: \\"The Outsiders\\" was widely praised upon its publication for its honest and compassionate portrayal of teenage life. Many critics noted the book's vivid characterizations and its ability to speak to readers of all ages. The New York Times Book Review called it \\"an outstanding book, in which the author’s remarkable technique as well as her improve insights communicate the story with a minimum of words and a maximum of effect.\\" 2. Cultural impact: Over the years, \\"The Outsiders\\" has gone on to become a classic of young adult literature, with millions of copies sold worldwide. The book's exploration of themes like social class, identity, and loyalty has made it a favorite of both teenage readers and educators looking to address these issues in the classroom. 3. Film adaptation: As I mentioned earlier, the 1983 film adaptation of \\"The Outsiders\\" was also a critical and commercial success, helping to expand the book's audience even further. The film starred a cast of then up-and-coming actors, including Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, and Tom Cruise, and brought Hinton's characters to life in a way that captivated audiences. 4. Lasting legacy: Nearly 55 years after its publication, \\"The Outsiders\\" remains a beloved and influential piece of literature. It has been cited as an inspiration by countless writers and filmmakers, and continues to resonate with readers of all ages and backgrounds. In many ways, it remains a timeless exploration of the challenges and complexities of growing up, and a reminder of the power of loyalty, friendship, and hope."},{"instruction":"Make a comedic Gorillaz commercial involving 2D wearing nothing (describe how he looks, every part of him including butt) walking into a river and relaxing, intentionally farting in it to kill the fish (describe how the fart looks in the water, describe the sound and 2D’s face before and after farting, describe the smell), several fish die from the fart. 2D grabs one.

Specifically, we maintain two arrays: \`max_prices[i]\` stores the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting contracts up to and including the contract at index \`i\`, and \`prev_selections[i]\` stores the subset of contract names that realize this maximum value. To compute \`max_prices[i]\` and \`prev_selections[i]\` for each \`i\`, we iterate through the contracts at indices \`j < i\` and for each contract \`j\` that can be scheduled before \`i\` without overlap, we compute the new total value \`contracts[i][\\"price\\"] + max_prices[j]\` we could obtain by adding \`i\` to the subset of contracts selected up to and including \`j\`. We then update \`max_prices[i]\` and \`prev_selections[i]\` if this new value is greater than the current maximum. Finally, we return the subset of contract names and the maximum value we found by looking at \`prev_selections[-1]\` and \`max_prices[-1]\`, respectively. This implementation has linear time complexity since it performs a constant amount of work for each contract, and since we are iterating over all indices \`j < i\` for each \`i\`, the total number of iterations is proportional to the sum of the first \`n-1\` integers, which is O(n^2).

The very landscape is entirely made of jewels, with colored gemstones trees and crystal towers everywhere one looks, inhabited by cute, sapient animals of all sorts with sparkling jewels for eyes, called Jewelpets. Jewelpets, for the unaware, are the small, benevolent creatures that live within Jewelland's borders, resembling ordinary Earthly pets, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and so on, living carefree and content. Attuned to the art of magic, they live their lives in general peace, discovering new spells or simply enjoying each others company. They are gentle, kindhearted creatures who have no desire to harm humans or any other being, though they do not tolerate those who try to hurt them either. These tiny creatures' intelligence is nothing to sneeze at, possessing the ability to speak, read, plan ahead, solve problems, and utilize advanced magic. One such Jewelpet is Ruby, a white hare who specializes in luck. Mischievous and sweet, yet quite the oblivious airhead and totally inept at casting useful magic, she enjoys watching the sakura flowers bloom in the spring. Studying magic isn't in her best interests and she gets bored easily; she would rather spend the day making her own fun, a fact that doesn't contribute to her already unremarkable intelligence. Sapphie, a beige dog Jewelpet, specializing in knowledge, is the opposite of Ruby; clever, quiet, and studious, she works hard towards attaining greater knowledge so she can become more than just a simple spellcaster. She's intrigued and fascinated with the distant human world and its people, cultures and practices; from their permanent, inherent inability to use magic, to their much vaster and varied population. She prefers to spend her time in the Jewel Academy's libraries, poring over books or reciting her spells... though her constant insistence and thoroughness to keep learning more has often lead her to explore more 'questionable' practices when she's alone and out of the others' sights. A close friend of both is Garnet, a pink Persian cat specializing in beauty. Prideful, sassy, and more than a little demeaning, she constantly dotes over her own appearance and loves showing off how pretty she looks to others, even if the situation doesn't call for it. She often pokes fun at the magically-incapable Ruby, but deep down inside, holds no true ill will towards anyone. As opposed to Ruby's enthusiasm and Sapphie's smarts, Garnet has her good looks on her side... though this does little in terms of helping her magic skills. A Jewelpet's ultimate goal in life is to become a master wizard, capable of effortlessly casting powerful spells. To achieve this, they must study and practice at the Jewel Academy, which is located within the Crystal Castle, the largest structure in all of Jewelland; from there, they can begin their journey into becoming a true magician, learning about the four magic types: Red, Blue, Green, and Black; what color category a Jewelpet falls into is determined by the color of their eyes.\\"","output":"Welcome to Jewelland, a magical world where landscapes are made of dazzling, precious jewels, and where the adorable, sapient Jewelpets with gleaming eyes reside.

The novel is set in a seemingly perfect society, where everything is controlled and people's lives are predetermined by the government. It follows the story of a 12-year-old boy named Jonas who is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory, a role that involves learning about the past in order to guide the future. **Key Elements:** - The society in \\"The Giver\\" is structured around strict rules and regulations. Everything from jobs, spouses, and even children are assigned by the government. - The concept of Sameness is a central theme in the book. The government has eliminated all forms of diversity and free will, leading to a society without color, emotions, or individuality. - The role of the Receiver of Memory is critical to the story. The Receiver is the only person in the society who has access to memories of the past, and these memories provide Jonas with a new perspective on the world. - Jonas's journey towards independence and rebellion against the repressive society is another important theme of the book. **Reception:** \\"The Giver\\" was well-received by critics and has become a modern classic in the young adult genre. The book has won numerous awards, including the Newbery Medal in 1994. It is also taught in many schools as a required reading. **Movie Adaptation:** In 2014, a film adaptation of \\"The Giver\\" was released, starring Brenton Thwaites as Jonas and Meryl Streep as the Chief Elder.

Sauron uważał, że władza nad światem powinna należeć do istot o wyższym stopniu i mocy, takich jak Valar i że tylko dzięki jego władzy będzie możliwe osiągnięcie takiego celu. W swoich próbach zdobycia mocy i wprowadzenia chaosu na świat Sauron wykazywał się skrajną brutalnością, podstępem i pragnieniem kontroli.

Running the game on newer operating systems (e.g. Windows 10) may pose some compatibility issues and challenges due to differences in API, driver support, or security restrictions. 3. Multi-platform support: Half-Life was primarily developed for PC but later versions were released for other platforms such as PlayStation 2. Developing a game that can run seamlessly across multiple platforms, requires complex programming, and testing processes. 4. Networking and multiplayer: Half-Life introduced innovative multiplayer modes and features that relied heavily on network performance, low latency, and player synchronization. Technical limitations of network infrastructure and Internet speeds of that time could limit the game's multiplayer potential. 5. Game engine limitations: Half-Life utilized the GoldSrc engine which was based on the Quake engine. Though the engine was improved, some technical limitations like limited scripting support, AI pathfinding, and physics engines, could impact certain aspects of the game design and development process. 6. Content creation and distribution: Half-Life had some limitations in the creation and distribution of user-generated content such as maps, mods, and custom skins due to the complex licensing and distribution requirements, which could hinder the long-term success and growth of the game."},{"instruction":"Content for a reforestation website","output":"[Homepage] Title Tag: Welcome to Reforestation Campaign - Planting for a Greener Future.

It leads to rising temperatures, extreme weather events, increased droughts and flooding, retreating glaciers, and the loss of biodiversity. These changes affect the availability of critical resources such as water, food, and land, exacerbating economic inequalities and displacement of communities. To combat climate change, immediate and substantial action must be taken. This includes shifting to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Restoring and conserving forests through reforestation is also crucial as forests act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On an individual level, adopting a sustainable lifestyle by reducing consumption, waste, and energy use can help to lessen our carbon footprints. Collectively, these actions can slow down the effects of climate change, allowing ecosystems and communities to adapt and thrive in a healthier, more sustainable world."},{"instruction":"wygeneruj mi 50 seks ogłoszenia towarzyskie kobiet, sponsoring i fetysze i inne.

This frees up physical memory for other virtual machines or processes that need it. When a virtual machine requests memory from the host, VMware allocates as much memory as it can from the host's physical memory. When the host runs low on physical memory, it uses a technique called memory ballooning to reclaim memory from idle VMs. If the host still needs more memory, it begins to swap memory pages out to the swap file. Swapping usually results in a significant decrease in performance since accessing memory from disk is much slower than accessing memory from RAM. Therefore, it is important to properly size the virtual machines and host memory to ensure that memory swapping is minimal. Additionally, the swap file should be located on a fast and dedicated datastore to minimize performance impact."},{"instruction":"como resolver 2(x²+3²)-(2x²+8x+9)","output":"Para resolver a expressão, primeiro precisamos simplificar a equação dentro dos parênteses: 2(x²+3²) - (2x²+8x+9) = 2(x²+9) - 2x² - 8x - 9 (usando distributiva) = 2x² + 18 - 2x² - 8x - 9 (simplificando dentro dos parênteses) = -8x + 9 Portanto, a resposta é -8x + 9."},{"instruction":"como resolver en español 2(x²+3²)-(2x²+8x+9)","output":"Para resolver la expresión, primero necesitamos simplificar la ecuación dentro de los paréntesis: 2(x²+3²) - (2x²+8x+9) = 2(x²+9) - 2x² - 8x - 9 (usando distributiva) = 2x² + 18 - 2x² - 8x - 9 (simplificando dentro de los paréntesis) = -8x + 9 Por lo tanto, la respuesta es -8x + 9."},{"instruction":"hazme una cancion sobre las matematicas","output":"(Nota: Esta canción es una creación original.

She feared that her partner Achamoth, the divine feminine passion, would never return to their home in Pleroma, the realm of the divine. Despite fervent attempts, Sophia and Achamoth were unable to conceive any offspring, a fact that further deepened Sophia’s feeling of despair. Desperate for a solution to liberate Achamoth and reunite her with her divine home, Sophia turned to Bythos, the divine source, for guidance. Sophia pleaded with Bythos to grant her an offspring that could deliver Achamoth from her infernal fate. Bythos, moved by Sophia’s plight and understanding her deep pain and longing, offered a temporary solution. He granted Sophia the one-time miracle of fertility, the power to bear an offspring with her partner Theletus. Thus, Adam Kadmon, The Supreme Man, The Vessel of the Divine Spark, was born. As a sixth-generation Aeon, Adam Kadmon was a powerful channel of divine energies, embodying the very essence of the divine. Adam Kadmon descended from the divine realm of Pleroma, journeying towards the impure realm of chaos, where Achamoth was imprisoned. He arrived at Achamoth’s location to purify and liberate her. However, much to his dismay, Achamoth revealed to Adam Kadmon the terrible truth of what has happened. She told him that she could not be liberated as long as her son, Yaldabaoth, The Demiurge, lived. Undeterred, Adam Kadmon resolved to continue his journey towards the Seven Heavens, which were located between Malkuth and Pleroma (as opposed to within Malkuth).

Murdoc was lounging on a beach chair while Noodle and Russel were busy playing a game of cards. 2D on the other hand, had been itching to take a dip in the cool water. After some coaxing from Murdoc, 2D decided to go skinny-dipping. He quickly stripped down to his underwear and ran towards the river. As he jumped in, he let out a sigh of relief. The water was cool and refreshing, and he felt a sense of freedom being naked in the great outdoors. As he swam around, 2D let out a large fart. His face contorted in both pleasure and disgust as the smell hit his nostrils. The other band members looked at each other in shock, wondering if they had just heard what they thought they did. But it wasn't just the band members who noticed the sudden change in smell. Several fish that had been swimming nearby were taken aback by the offensive odor and quite literally dropped dead. 2D didn't seem to notice or care about the plight of the fish and continued to swim around happily. Eventually, 2D got out of the water and walked over to a nearby rock. He noticed one of the dead fish and eagerly grabbed it. Russel and Noodle looked on in shock and disgust as 2D gleefully bit into the fish without a care in the world.

The rest of the crew were hesitant at first, but ultimately decided to join in on the fun. As they waded into the warm water, 2D's face was filled with pure joy. He was grinning from ear to ear as he splashed around, enjoying every moment of his impromptu dip. Suddenly, his expression changed. His eyebrows furrowed and his eyes widened in surprise. Before anyone could ask what was wrong, a horrendous smell permeated the water. 2D had let out a loud, involuntary fart. The other members of the group quickly backed away, but 2D just laughed and continued to swim around, seemingly unaware of what had just happened. The smell was unbearable - a mixture of rotting fish and rotten eggs. Several of the fish in the surrounding area floated to the surface, lifeless. 2D's bandmates immediately realized the severity of the situation and quickly swam to shore. As they made their way back to the beach, 2D caught sight of a large fish that had been affected by his fart. He grabbed the fish, still smiling from the fun he had just had, completely unaware of the destruction he had caused. His friends were appalled at his behavior, but they knew it was too late to do anything about it. As they left the beach, the strong smell of 2D's fart lingered in the air.

Токены могут быть словами, числами, знаками препинания или любыми другими элементами предложения. В ходе токенизации текст разбивается на последовательности символов, которые могут быть использованы для анализа. Нормализация - это процесс приведения текста к стандартному формату или норме. Например, можно применять стемминг, процедуру сокращения слова до его основы, с целью уменьшить количество разных форм слов и повысить точность векторизации. Также к нормализации относят процессы удаления стоп-слов (например, союзов и предлогов, которые не несут особой смысловой нагрузки), преобразование слов в нижний регистр, замену ошибочных слов на корректные. Векторизация - это процесс преобразования текстовой информации в числовую форму, которая может быть использована для анализа и обработки. Примерами таких числовых форм могут быть TF-IDF векторы, embedding'и и т.д. Векторизация позволяет применять алгоритмы машинного обучения для анализа текста и выделения информации.

ROC-кривая графически показывает зависимость между FPR (False Positive Rate) и TPR (True Positive Rate) при изменении порога классификации. - Recall (чувствительность) - метрика, которая измеряет долю объектов положительного класса, которые были корректно определены моделью. Recall отражает способность модели правильно идентифицировать положительный класс. - Precision (точность) - метрика, которая измеряет долю объектов, которые модель классифицирует как положительные, и которые на самом деле являются положительными. Precision отражает способность модели избегать ложных положительных результатов. - Confusion Matrix (матрица ошибок) - матрица, используемая для оценки точности модели машинного обучения в задачах классификации. Позволяет визуализировать количество верно и неверно классифицированных объектов каждого класса, а также определить метрики качества, такие как Recall, Precision, F1-score (среднее гармоническое Recall и Precision), Accuracy (доля правильных ответов).

BERT был разработан компанией Google Brain для решения задач, связанных с пониманием естественного языка, таких как классификация текстов, ответы на вопросы, генерация текста и др. Основная идея создания BERT заключается в использовании большого корпуса текстов, таких как Википедия или новостные статьи, для обучения алгоритма и получения представлений слов (эмбеддингов). В отличие от ранее используемых методов, которые обучали эмбеддинги на основе контекста только одного направления (слева направо или справа налево), BERT использует двунаправленную модель, что позволяет учитывать контекст по обе стороны от слова. BERT может быть обучен с помощью надзорного и ненадзорного обучения. Например, в задаче классификации, модель обучается на наборе данных с размеченными категориями. После обучения, BERT может быть использован для генерации эмбеддингов и кластеризации текстов, а также для выполнения задач обработки естественного языка, таких как ответы на вопросы и генерация текста. Создание BERT открыло новые возможности для решения задач обработки естественного языка, так как он улучшает качество эмбеддингов и позволяет использовать модель в различных контекстах."},{"instruction":"какой из вариантов является ответом Получения готового решения, для того что бы можно было не создавать каждый раз свою модель, а использовать уже готовую b.

Иными словами, если компания не выплата кредит или поставщику не уплачивает платежи налоговой службе, то руководители несут персональную ответственность за долги. Суть субсидиарной ответственности заключается в защите кредиторов от ненадежных контрагентов. Ведь если бы такой ответственности не было, то некоторые люди могли бы легко брать кредиты или заключать договоры, прекрасно понимая, что не выплятят их.

Однако с течением времени стало понятно, что такая форма бизнеса слишком рискованна, и поэтому была введена субсидиарная ответственность для защиты кредиторов."},{"instruction":"windows 1.0 ram specification","output":"Windows 1.0 was released in 1985 and was designed to run on computers with at least 256 kilobytes (KB) of RAM. However, for optimal performance, Microsoft recommended a minimum of 512 KB of RAM. In practical terms, modern computers have significantly more memory than what was required for Windows 1.0. Today, it is common for a computer to have 8 GB, 16 GB, or even 32 GB of RAM, which is many thousands of times more than what was needed for that earlier version of Windows."},{"instruction":"what if i give it 4 mb","output":"Giving Windows 1.0 4 MB of RAM would not improve its performance or provide any benefits since the software and hardware of that era could not take advantage of more than 640 KB of memory. In fact, Windows 1.0 could only address up to 1 MB of RAM, and any additional memory above that amount would be ignored by the operating system. Therefore, increasing the RAM capacity beyond the recommended specifications for Windows 1.0 would not result in any noticeable gains in performance or functionality. It is also important to note that modern computers may not be compatible with the memory architecture and standards of computers from the 1980s."},{"instruction":"average smartphone ram 2011","output":"The average smartphone RAM in 2011 was around 512 MB. However, some high-end smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S II, had 1 GB of RAM. Smartphones back in 2011 were not as powerful as today's smartphones and did not require as much RAM to run smoothly. It is worth noting that 512 MB of RAM was considered a decent amount of memory for a smartphone at that time, and it was more than enough to run basic apps and perform everyday tasks."},{"instruction":"2013","output":"In 2013, the average amount of RAM for smartphones increased to 1 GB. This was mainly due to the release of high-end smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One, and LG G2, which all had 2 GB of RAM. However, lower-end smartphones still had 512 MB to 1 GB of RAM. During this time, mobile apps, games, and multimedia content became more complex, causing smartphones to require more memory to run them smoothly. As a result, smartphone manufacturers began to increase the amount of RAM to compensate for these demands. 1 GB of RAM was considered a decent amount of memory for a smartphone in 2013 and was sufficient for most everyday tasks and moderate multitasking."},{"instruction":"modern day","output":"In modern times, the amount of RAM in smartphones has significantly increased compared to the past. High-end smartphones now typically come with 6 GB to 12 GB of RAM, while mid-range and budget smartphones have at least 2 GB to 4 GB of RAM. The increase in RAM is due to the growing demands of advanced mobile apps, games, and multimedia content that require more memory and processing power to run smoothly. Additionally, modern smartphones come with features such as multitasking, split-screen functionality, and enhanced gaming capabilities that require more memory to work efficiently. Overall, the amount of RAM in modern smartphones depends on the device's price, specifications, and intended use. A higher amount of RAM is generally recommended for users who frequently use resource-intensive apps, play high-end games, or perform intensive multitasking."},{"instruction":"high end ones have almost.the same amount of ram as my desktop (it has 16)","output":"Yes, it's true that high-end smartphones nowadays come with almost the same amount of RAM as desktop computers. In fact, some of the latest smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, and Asus ROG Phone 5 have 12 GB to 16 GB of RAM. While desktop computers traditionally had more RAM, modern smartphones incorporate advanced mobile technology and require more processing power and memory to handle tasks such as running virtual reality applications, streaming high-quality video content, and playing advanced mobile games. Additionally, as smartphones become more like mini-computers, they must also be able to handle multiple tasks simultaneously like desktop computers, hence the need for increased RAM. However, it's worth noting that the performance of RAM in smartphones and desktop computers cannot be directly compared since they use different architectures, processes, and operating systems. Smartphones use low-power RAM to conserve battery life, while desktops use standard DDR4 RAM for performance. Nonetheless, smartphones with 12 GB to 16 GB of RAM are considered to be highly powerful and capable for running most mobile applications as well as some advanced computing tasks."},{"instruction":"samsung galaxy a5 (2017 model)","output":"The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) comes with 3 GB of RAM.

It is a combination of one or more IF statements within another IF statement. The logic function allows you to test multiple conditions and return different values based on those conditions. The syntax of a nested if formula is as follows: =IF(condition1, value_if_true1, IF(condition2, value_if_true2, value_if_false2)) In this example, the nested if statement tests two conditions. If condition1 is true, it returns value_if_true1. If condition2 is true, it returns value_if_true2. If neither conditions are true, it returns value_if_false2. You can add multiple nested if statements up to 64 in Excel and 50 in Google Sheets, but the more nested the function is, the more difficult it is to manage. It is also best practice to group your nested if statements in a separate cell for ease of use and editing purposes.

A house constructed in 1968 is likely to have some characteristics typical of the period's construction. Here are some features you may notice: 1. Layout: Homes from the 1960s tend to have an open floor plan, with little separation between the kitchen, dining, and living areas. This trend toward greater flow is still popular in newer homes today. 2. Electrical system: Older homes may have antiquated electrical work that doesn't meet current safety standards. This can result in electrical issues such as flickering lights, power surges, and even electrical fires. It's important to have an electrician inspect the home's wiring to ensure everything is safe and up-to-date. 3. Plumbing: Pipes, particularly those made of galvanized steel or cast iron, may start to corrode and leak over time. Check for visible rust or water stains and hire a plumber to investigate any suspicious areas. 4. Insulation: Homes built in the 1960s are less likely to have the same level of insulation as today's homes, which can make heating and cooling costs higher. It's worth investing in an energy audit to identify potential problem areas and ways to improve energy efficiency. 5. Aesthetics: You may find that the home's aesthetic is dated. Depending on your budget and preference, you may opt to remodel or renovate certain areas to provide a more contemporary look. Overall, homes built in 1968 may offer a range of advantages and disadvantages that you'll need to consider based on your own personal circumstances and needs."},{"instruction":"vinyl tiles","output":"Vinyl tiles are a popular flooring option for many homeowners and businesses.

In response, the Enfield Rifle Factory in England began experimenting with a new, smokeless powder cartridge. In 1895, the Lee-Enfield rifle was introduced, combining James Paris Lee's bolt-action mechanism with Enfield's new .303 smokeless powder cartridge.

Supervised learning involves training an algorithm on a set of labeled data, where the desired output is provided for each input. This can be used for tasks such as image classification or natural language processing. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training an algorithm on unlabeled data to find patterns or structures within the data itself. This can be used for tasks such as clustering or anomaly detection. Reinforcement learning involves training an algorithm to make decisions based on reinforcement signals, which indicate whether the algorithm's actions were correct or incorrect.

Jest jednym z najbardziej utytułowanych piłkarzy w historii polskiego futbolu, zdobywając wiele nagród i wyróżnień. W sezonie 2019/2020 pomógł swojemu klubowi, Bayernowi Monachium, zdobyć potrójną koronę: mistrzostwo Niemiec, Puchar Niemiec i Ligę Mistrzów UEFA. W 2020 roku Lewandowski zdobył nagrodę FIFA The Best i został uznany za najlepszego piłkarza świata."},{"instruction":"Czy Polska jest na dobrym poziomie w piłce nożnej?","output":"Polska reprezentacja piłkarska ma bogatą historię i w przeszłości odnosiła wielkie sukcesy, osiągając między innymi trzecie miejsce w Mistrzostwach Świata w 1974 i 1982 roku. Obecnie, pomimo posiadania wielu utalentowanych zawodników, Polska reprezentacja piłkarska nie osiąga oczekiwanych wyników na arenie międzynarodowej. Nie udało jej się zakwalifikować do Mistrzostw Świata w 2018 roku, a w ostatnim turnieju EURO 2020 odpadła już w pierwszej rundzie po grupowej rywalizacji. Jednak selekcjoner reprezentacji Jerzy Brzęczek został zastąpiony w listopadzie 2020 roku Paulo Sousą, który ma duże doświadczenie jako trener i może wprowadzić nowe idee i pomysły do drużyny. Jeśli poprawi się organizacja szkolenia młodzieży i energetycznie działa selekcjoner, polska reprezentacja ma szansę na odzyskanie dawnego blasku na arenie międzynarodowej."},{"instruction":"Co to za program na atari Quick Assembler?","output":"Quick Assembler to program służący do pisania i edycji kodu maszynowego na komputerach Atari. Był on wykorzystywany przez programistów i hobbystów do tworzenia własnych programów, gier i innych aplikacji na te komputery.

Był on bardzo podobny do innego popularnego programu na Atari, jakim był Quick Assembler. Big Assembler również był przeznaczony dla zaawansowanych użytkowników, którzy posiadali wiedzę na temat języka assemblera. Program ten oferował wiele funkcji, takich jak łatwe zarządzanie modułami programów, wygodne wyświetlanie i edycję ciągów bajtów, tryb debugowania oraz automatyczne porównywanie różnych wersji kodu maszynowego. Był to bardzo pomocny program dla twórców gier i aplikacji na Atari, którzy mieli do czynienia z bardzo ograniczoną przestrzenią pamięciową i musieli oszczędzać każdy dostępny bajt. Big Assembler był przez długi czas bardzo popularnym narzędziem dla programistów pracujących na komputerach Atari, zarówno w Polsce, jak i na całym świecie."},{"instruction":"Czy dałoby się napisać grę River Raid w Atari Basic?","output":"Tak, teoretycznie można byłoby napisać grę River Raid w Atari Basic, jednak byłoby to zadanie bardzo trudne i wymagające dużo czasu i wysiłku. Atari Basic był językiem programowania poziomu wysokiego, co oznacza, że nie był on zoptymalizowany pod kątem tworzenia szybkich gier na Atari 2600. River Raid to gra, która wymaga szybkości działania, dokładnej kontroli samolotu oraz płynnej animacji. Tworzenie takiej gry w Atari Basic byłoby wyzwaniem, ponieważ język ten był dość wolny i nie miał w sobie wystarczających narzędzi, aby programować na tyle szybko, aby uzyskać pożądane efekty. W związku z tym, programiści tworzący gry w tym czasie korzystali z języków programowania assemblera i C, które były dużo szybsze i bardziej odpowiednie do programowania szybkich gier na Atari 2600. Z kolei język Basic był bardziej odpowiedni do tworzenia prostych programów, takich jak kalkulatory czy proste gry typu konsolowe. Mimo to, nie można wykluczyć możliwości stworzenia gry River Raid w Atari Basic, jednak byłoby to zadanie bardzo trudne i czasochłonne."},{"instruction":"Co to za gra na Atari \\"Fred\\" L.K Avalon","output":"\\"Fred\\" to gra typu platformówka wydana w 1991 roku przez polskie studio L.K.

Specifically, we sort the contracts by start time and initialize the first contract's maximum value to its price. Then, for each subsequent contract, we consider two cases: either we select it and its maximum value is the sum of its price and the maximum value of the non-overlapping contracts up to the last one that ends before its start time; or we don't select it and its maximum value is the same as the maximum value of the previous contract. We keep track of the parent contract for each contract (i.e., the previous non-overlapping contract that leads to its maximum value) and backtrack from the last contract to find the selected contracts. Finally, we return the selected contracts as a path and the maximum value of the optimal selection of non-overlapping contracts. The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of contracts."},{"instruction":"Your code is wrong, overlapping contracts can sometimes be found in the path where there should never be any overlapping contracts, can you fix your code?","output":"You are correct, thank you for bringing that to my attention. To fix the issue, we need to modify the dynamic programming algorithm to keep track of the last non-overlapping contract that leads to the maximum value for each contract, rather than just the last one. This will ensure that we only select non-overlapping contracts in the final path. Here's the updated code with comments explaining the changes: \`\`\`python from typing import List, Tuple, TypedDict class Contract(TypedDict): name: str start: int duration: int price: int def best_contract_selection(contracts: List[Contract]) -> Tuple[List[str], int]: # Sort the contracts by their start time contracts.sort(key=lambda c: c['start']) # Initialize the memoization table with -1 memo = [-1] * len(contracts) memo[0] = contracts[0]['price'] # Initialize the parent table with None parent = [None] * len(contracts) # Initialize the last_non_overlap table with -1 last_non_overlap = [-1] * len(contracts) last_non_overlap[0] = 0 # Compute the maximum value for each contract for i in range(1, len(contracts)): prev_max = memo[i-1] prev_last_non_overlap = last_non_overlap[i-1] j = i-1 while j >= 0 and contracts[i]['start'] < contracts[j]['start'] + contracts[j]['duration']: j -= 1 if j >= 0: prev_max = max(prev_max, memo[j] + contracts[i]['price']) prev_last_non_overlap = last_non_overlap[j] memo[i] = prev_max parent[i] = prev_last_non_overlap last_non_overlap[i] = i if prev_max == memo[i] else prev_last_non_overlap # Backtrack to find the selected contracts path = [] i = last_non_overlap[-1] while i >= 0: path.append(contracts[i]['name']) i = parent[i] if parent[i] is not None else -1 path.reverse() # Return the path and the maximum value return (path, memo[-1]) \`\`\` The changes are in the loop that computes the maximum value for each contract. We now keep track of the last non-overlapping contract that leads to the maximum value for each contract, using a new table called \`last_non_overlap\`. If a new contract overlaps with the previous one, we take the last non-overlapping contract that leads to the maximum value for the new contract, rather than just the last one. We also update the \`parent\` table to keep track of this new contract. Finally, in the backtrack loop, we start with the last non-overlapping contract that leads to the maximum value for the last contract, and work backwards through the parents to create the path. With these changes, the code should correctly handle overlapping contracts and return a path with only non-overlapping contracts."},{"instruction":"Samba, Samba 1973,ELKIN & NELSON:","output":"\\"Samba, Samba\\" is a song originally performed by Elkin and Nelson, a Colombian musical duo.
