Step 2: Expand the dot product equation: overrightarrow{a}⋅(overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}) = overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b} = 0. Step 3: Knowing |overrightarrow{a}|=3, we can find overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{a} = |overrightarrow{a}|^2 = 9. Substitute this into the equation from Step 2: 9 + overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b} = 0. Step 4: Solve for overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b}: overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b} = -9. Step 5: To find the projection vector of overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{a}, we use the formula for the projection of overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{a}, which is given by: text{proj}_{overrightarrow{a}} overrightarrow{b} = frac{overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|^2} cdot overrightarrow{a}. Step 6: Substitute the values we have into the formula: text{proj}_{overrightarrow{a}} overrightarrow{b} = frac{-9}{9} cdot overrightarrow{a} = -overrightarrow{a}.

According to the problem, we have: vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} = 0. Rearrange the equation to get: vec{OA} = -(vec{OB} + vec{OC}). In this case, vec{OB} + vec{OC} must be the vector that is both equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the vector vec{OA}. Since O is the circumcenter, we know that OA=OB=OC in length, and thus the magnitude of vec{OA} is equal to the magnitude of vec{OB} + vec{OC}. This implies that BOC is a straight line, hence angle BOC is 180°. Now, considering triangle BOC divided into two by the diameter, we know that angle BAC is twice the angle formed by arc BC that does not contain the vertex A. Since angle BOC is a straight line (180°), the arc BC that does not include the point A measures 180° as well. Thus, angle BAC is: angle A = 2 times frac{text{arc } BC}{2} = text{arc } BC = 180°. However, in a triangle, an interior angle cannot be 180°, a straight line. Therefore, we consider that the angle we are interested in is the remaining part that forms the complete angle at point A, with respect to the full circle (360°), which is: angle A = 360° - text{arc } BC = 360° - 180° = 180°. Thus the correct interior angle that would close the triangle while keeping point O as the circumcenter is the other arc created by the line segment BC, which is 180° - 180°. However, there seems to be a mistake, as no reasonable interior angle for a triangle has been provided from this logic. Let's re-examine our vectors to find where we may have gone wrong. Since vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} = 0, and vectors represent displacements from the origin O to the vertices, this means that the center of the triangle (centroid G), when considered in the vector sum, would be at the origin O. But in a triangle, the centroid (G), the circumcenter (O), and the orthocenter (H) are collinear, lying on the Euler line. Remember that in an equilateral triangle, the centroid, the circumcenter, and the orthocenter are all the same point. Thus, O being the circumcenter coinciding with the centroid implies that triangle ABC must be equilateral. Therefore, all interior angles in an equilateral triangle are equal, which means: angle A = angle B = angle C = frac{360°}{3} = 120°.

Visual inspection or plotting might help, but let's proceed analytically: 1. The function y=cos x completes a full cycle from 0 to 2pi, and then repeats every 2pi. The key areas to check for intersections are from 2pi n to 2pi n + pi and 2pi n + pi to 2pi n + 2pi for each integer n. 2. Since left(frac{1}{3}right)^x will exponentially decrease, every next peak and trough of cos x is at a significantly lower value than the previous, making intersections less frequent as x increases. 3. For each interval (2pi n, 2pi n + pi) where cos x is positive, it generally crosses the graph of left(frac{1}{3}right)^x once until it becomes so small that cos x doesn't reach the value of left(frac{1}{3}right)^x. The threshold is when cos x approx left(frac{1}{3}right)^x does not intersect, potentially around when n is large enough for left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2pi n} to be significantly lower than 1, around n > 12. While in (2pi n + pi, 2pi n + 2pi) where cos x is negative, no intersections occur. With the interval (0,50pi) and each repeating pattern of 2pi, we do calculations for n = 0 to n = 24. Since every positive peak (every pi section) intersects roughly once every 2pi, the total estimated intersections are initially expected to be nearly 25. However, considering decay, intersections cease around the 12th peak.

Let's denote the set of the (100) distinct natural numbers as (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}). 2. To verify the existence of such numbers, consider two specific constructions.       First Construction:     - Take the numbers as multiples of (100!): (100!, frac{100!}{2}, frac{100!}{3}, ldots, frac{100!}{100}).     - Note that (100!) is the factorial of (100), implying it is the product of all integers from (1) to (100):       [       100! = 1 times 2 times 3 times ldots times 100.       ]     - Consider the product of any (52) numbers out of our set of (100):       [       P_{52} = left(100!right)^{52-k} prod_{i=1, i neq j_1, j_2, ldots, j_{52}}^{100} frac{1}{i},       ]       where (k) indices ((j_1, j_2, ldots, j_{52})) are omitted from the total product. Essentially, (P_{52}) includes factors where (k=48).     - The remaining (48) numbers' product is:       [       P_{48} = left(100!right)^{48} prod_{i in J_{48}} frac{1}{i}.       ]     - Hence, when dividing (P_{52}) by (P_{48}), we get:       [       frac{P_{52}}{P_{48}} = frac{left(100!right)^{52}}{left(100!right)^{48}} prod_{i in J_{48}} frac{1}{i} prod_{i=1, i neq j_1, ldots, j_{52}}^{100} frac{1}{i} = left(100!right)^4.       ]     - Since (100!) is an integer and a divisor of the factorial factorials, the products indeed divide as expected.      Second Construction:     - Assign numbers as powers of (2): (2^n, 2^{n+1}, ldots, 2^{n+99}).     - For (n geq 575), the product of any (52) of these numbers is:       [       2^{sum_{i=0}^{51} (n+i)} = 2^{52n + frac{51 cdot 52}{2}},       ]       which simplifies to:       [       2^{52n + 1326}.       ]     - The product of the remaining (48) numbers:       [       2^{sum_{j=52}^{99} (n+j)} = 2^{48n + frac{48 cdot 151}{2}},       ]       which simplifies to:       [       2^{48n + 3624}.       ]     - We need to show that the exponent (52n + 1326) is greater than (48n + 3624):       [       52n + 1326 > 48n + 3624,       ]       simplifies to:       [       4n > 2298 implies n > frac{2298}{4} = 574.5.       ]     - Hence, any integer (n geq 575) will make (2^{52n+1326}) divisible by (2^{48n+3624}), confirming the inclusion of these powers of (2).  Conclusion: Thus, both constructions confirm that such (100) different natural numbers exist where the product of any (52) distinct numbers in the set is divisible by the product of the remaining (48) numbers.

Additionally, let (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n) be any rearrangement of the sequence, and let (B_1 geq B_2 geq ldots geq B_n) be another sequence that is sorted in the same non-increasing order as the (a_i)'s. 2. **Express the sums**    Consider the sums (S = sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i) and (S' = sum_{i=1}^n a_i B_i). We aim to show that (S leq S'). 3. **Rearrangement Inequality Application**    The rearrangement inequality states that for two sequences sorted in non-increasing order, the sum of products of corresponding terms is maximized when the sequences are similarly ordered.    This can be formally written as:    [    sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i leq sum_{i=1}^n a_i B_i    ] 4. **Swap elements to check effect on the sums**    To understand why this holds, consider swapping elements in the (b_i) sequence and observe the effect on the sum (S). Suppose we swap (b_i) and (b_j) in the sum (S) to create a new sum (S'):    [    S' = S + (a_i b_j + a_j b_i - a_i b_i - a_j b_j)    ]    The difference between the new sum (S') and the original sum (S) is:    [    S' - S = a_i b_j + a_j b_i - a_i b_i - a_j b_j     ]    [    = (a_i - a_j)(b_j - b_i)    ] 5. **Analyze the sign of (S' - S)**    Given (a_1 geq a_2 geq ldots geq a_n) and noting the ordering, if (i leq j), then (a_i geq a_j), which implies (a_i - a_j geq 0).    If also, (b_1 geq b_2 geq ldots geq b_n), then for the corresponding index swap, (b_j - b_i) will have the opposite or same sign of (a_i - a_j). Thus, rearranging such that larger (a_i)'s pair with larger (b_i)'s ensures each term ((a_i - a_j)(b_j - b_i) geq 0). 6. **Conclusion**        In rearranging according to the inequalities, the sum (sum_{i=1}^n a_i B_i) achieves the maximum possible value given the sequences' orders.

The task is to make this liquid evenly distributed such that one flask remains empty. This is trivially true since the single flask already has a uniform mixture of the liquid by default. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Suppose the statement is true for ( n ) liquids and ( n+1 ) flasks (where ( n ) flasks are full of different liquids and ( 1 ) flask is empty). We need to show it holds for ( n+1 ) liquids and ( n+2 ) flasks.    - Assume ( M_{1} ) is the empty flask and ( M_{2}, ldots, M_{n+2} ) are filled with different liquids.         - Temporarily set aside one flask, say ( M_{n+2} ), which contains the ((n+1))-th liquid. Now, we are left with ( n ) liquids in ( n + 1 ) flasks (where ( M_1 ) is empty).        - By the induction hypothesis, we can redistribute the first ( n ) liquids such that each of the flasks ( M_{2}, ldots, M_{n+1} ) contains a uniform mixture of all ( n ) liquids, and ( M_1 ) becomes empty.    - Next, we need to include the ( (n+1) )-th liquid from the flask ( M_{n+2} ) into this uniform configuration. Distribute the liquid from ( M_{n+2} ) equally among ( M_{1}, ldots, M_{n+1} ).    - Therefore, each flask ( M_{1}, ldots, M_{n+1} ) will now contain ( frac{1}{n} ) of each of the first ( n ) liquids plus an additional ( frac{1}{n+1} ) of the ((n+1))-th liquid. This makes the content uniform across all ( n+2 ) flasks except one still being empty.

The randomly thrown points can be denoted as ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( 0 leq x leq 1 ) and ( 0 leq y leq 1 ). 2. By treating these coordinates as a point ((x, y)) on a Cartesian plane, we can map them within the unit square where both coordinates range from 0 to 1. 3. To form a triangle out of three lengths created when the segment is divided by these points, we need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds true for all three sides. Let's assume ( x leq y ) without loss of generality. 4. For the triangle inequality to hold, each segment length must be less than the sum of the other two. The segments are:     - ( x )     - ( y - x )     - ( 1 - y )    The necessary inequalities are:    [    begin{aligned}    &1. quad x < (y - x) + (1 - y),     &2. quad y - x < x + (1 - y),     &3. quad 1 - y < x + (y - x).    end{aligned}    ] 5.

( 1 - y < y quad implies quad y > 0.5 )     Thus, given ( x leq y ), we also have ( x leq y < x + 0.5 ). 6.

On the Cartesian plane within the unit square, these inequalities describe a region forming a triangular area. 8. Next, consider the case ( x > y ). The segment splits into similar parts but positioned differently; thus, we derive the system:    [    begin{aligned}    &x > 0.5,     &y < 0.5,     &y > x - 0.5.    end{aligned}    ] This also forms a triangular region in the unit square. 9. Since both regions are triangular with an area ( frac{1}{8} ) each within the unit square, the combined area that satisfies the triangle inequality conditions is ( frac{1}{4} ). 10.

A line through the midpoint M of side AB meets the rays CA and CB at K and L respectively such that CK = CL. Point S is the circumcenter of the triangle CKL. We need to prove that SD = SM. 2. **Step 1**: Since M is the midpoint of AB and CK = CL, by Menelaus' theorem for triangle ABC cut by the straight line KML, we get AK = BL. This is because the product of the segments divided by the transversal in Menelaus' theorem must equal 1, and since M is the midpoint, AK = BL. 3. **Step 2**: Let E be the point where the circumcircle of triangle CKL intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at a point other than C. Since CK = CL, E is the center of the rotation carrying AK into BL. Due to EA = EB, E is the midpoint of the arc AB of odot(ABC).  4. **Step 3**: Since E lies on the internal bisector of angle ACB, O (the circumcenter of triangle CKL) lies on CE. Since CE is the circumdiameter of triangle CKL and is perpendicular to KL, O is the midpoint of CE. 5. **Step 4**: Let A' and B' denote the midpoints of CB and CA respectively.

Since M is the midpoint of AB and D is the foot of the altitude from C to AB, A'B'DM is an isosceles trapezoid. The perpendicular bisector of A'B' is the symmetry axis of this trapezoid. 7. **Step 6**: Since O lies on the perpendicular bisector of A'B' and A'B'DM is symmetric about this bisector, OD = OM.

Combining real and imaginary parts, we get: (x + yi)^4 = (x^4 - 6x^2 y^2 + y^4) + 4xy(x^2 - y^2)i.  For this expression to be real, the imaginary part must be zero: 4xy(x^2 - y^2) = 0.

Note that a is an odd number, ensuring that frac{a}{2^k} is an irreducible fraction and lies between 0 and 1.    - When P is of the form frac{a}{2^k}, at each jump, the position can change such that the denominator of the fraction representing the position decreases. 3. **Step 3: Analyze the reduction in denominator:**    - In each jump, if the grasshopper avoids traps, it will land within the interval (0, 1) and the distance to the nearest trap will halve.    - Specifically, if the current position is frac{a}{2^k}, after one jump by a distance frac{b}{2^k}, we get frac{a pm b}{2^k}. If a pm b is even, it implies that the resulting position can be represented by an irreducible fraction with a denominator that is a power of 2 and smaller. 4. **Step 4: Implementing the trapping strategy:**    - After multiple iterations, say k steps, the grasshopper’s position becomes an integer, either 0 or 1. This approach works because at each step, the denominator keeps decreasing, and eventually, the grasshopper will land exactly on 0 or 1. 5. **Step 5: Ensuring the grasshopper does not avoid the traps:**    - If P is not of the form frac{a}{2^k}, i.e., it's not a binary rational number, we can't guarantee the grasshopper will be trapped since it can potentially keep avoiding traps.    - Therefore, selecting positive distances of jump so that positions are progressively moving towards a trap is crucial in ensuring trapping. # Conclusion: For any positive number P in the form of P = a cdot 2^{-k}, where a and k are natural numbers and 0 < a < 2^{k}, the grasshopper can be guaranteed to fall into one of the traps at 0 or 1.

Therefore, events C and D are mutually exclusive, making option C correct. - **For option D:** We calculate the probabilities as follows:   - P(B) = frac{1}{4} because regardless of the first draw, there's always one specific ball that needs to be drawn second out of the remaining three.   - P(D) = frac{2 times 2}{{4 choose 2}} = frac{1}{3} because there are two ways to draw balls that sum to 5 (labels 1 and 4, or labels 2 and 3) out of the {4 choose 2} = 6 total ways to draw two balls.   - P(BD) = frac{1}{12} because there's only one combination (drawing a 2 first and a 3 second) out of the 12 possible sequences of drawing two balls without replacement that satisfies both B and D.   - Since P(B)P(D) = frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{12} = P(BD), it shows that events B and D are independent.

To do this, we need to express z in terms of x. First, let's solve for y in terms of z using the first equation: y = (0.45z) / 0.72 Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation to express z in terms of x: (0.45z) / 0.72 = 0.75x Now, let's solve for z: 0.45z = 0.72 * 0.75x 0.45z = 0.54x Now, we want to find what percent of x is z, so we divide both sides by x: z / x = 0.54 / 0.45 Now, let's calculate the right side: z / x = 1.2 To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: z / x * 100 = 1.2 * 100 z / x * 100 = 120% Therefore, z is boxed{120%}  of x."},{"instruction":"f p / q = 4 / 5 , then the value of 11 / 7 + { ( some value ) / ( 2 q + p ) } is 2.

So we have: 11 / 7 + x / ( 2q + p ) = 2 To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, let's subtract 11/7 from both sides: x / ( 2q + p ) = 2 - 11 / 7 To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 7: x / ( 2q + p ) = (14/7) - (11/7) x / ( 2q + p ) = 3/7 Now, we need to solve for x by multiplying both sides by (2q + p): x = (3/7) * (2q + p) Since we know that p = (4/5)q, we can substitute this value into the equation: x = (3/7) * (2q + (4/5)q) To combine the terms with q, we need a common denominator, which is 5: x = (3/7) * ((10/5)q + (4/5)q) x = (3/7) * ((14/5)q) Now, we can multiply the fractions: x = (3 * 14) / (7 * 5) * q x = 42 / 35 * q Since q is not zero, we can simplify the fraction: x = (6/5) * q Now, we need to find the value of q.

The rate of spin of the gyroscope doubles every 15 seconds. This means that the speed of the gyroscope is increasing exponentially, and we can use the formula for exponential growth to find the initial speed: Final speed = Initial speed * (Rate of increase)^(Time/Time interval for increase) In this case, the rate of increase is doubling, so the rate is 2. The time interval for increase is 15 seconds. The time is 90 seconds because a minute and a half is 90 seconds. Let's denote the initial speed as S. 400 = S * 2^(90/15) Since 90/15 is 6, the equation simplifies to: 400 = S * 2^6 2^6 is 64, so: 400 = S * 64 Now, we solve for S: S = 400 / 64 S = 6.25 Therefore, the initial speed of the gyroscope when the stopwatch was started was boxed{6.25}  meters per second."},{"instruction":"have a bag with 8 marbles numbered from 1 to 8.

Asking the same question Are you Giraffe? in the same order, he could also understand where Jackal was, but full clarity did not occur. Only after asking Are you Parrot? did the first one answer Yes, and Hedgehog finally realized the order in which the animals were standing. What is that order?","output":"1. Let's start by understanding the behavior of each animal:     - Jackal always lies.     - Lion always tells the truth.     - Parrot repeats the last heard answer (answers randomly if asked first).     - Giraffe gives a truthful answer to the previous question, but answers randomly if asked first. 2. When the wise Hedgehog asks the first question, \\"Are you the Jackal?\\", the Lion and Jackal will both say \\"No\\" because:     - The Jackal lies.     - The Lion tells the truth.     However, it is mentioned that the Hedgehog could only determine Giraffe without recognizing the Parrot. This implies:     - The Giraffe must have said \\"Yes\\" to the question “Are you the Jackal?” because it answers randomly when asked first.     - The Parrot must have said \\"No\\" because it repeats the answer it last heard, which in the first round would be no specific pattern. 3. In the second round, the Hedgehog asks, \\"Are you the Giraffe?\\", and identifies the Jackal. This implies:     - The Lion and Giraffe will say \\"No\\" (Giraffe is thinking it is being asked again if it's the Jackal due to its one-question delay mechanism).     - The Parrot would repeat the last heard answer which could be \\"No\\".     - The Jackal would lie and say \\"Yes\\".     This allows the Hedgehog to determine who the Jackal is. 4. In the third question, Hedgehog asks, \\"Are you the Parrot?\\" and determines the animal order. Therefore:     - The Parrot, if it repeats previous answers, would not say \\"Yes\\" unless the last heard \\"Yes\\".     - This question helps Hedgehog clarify each animal position.      5. After these series of questions, Hedgehog could deduce:     - The only animal that repeats previous answers and can randomly say \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" at the beginning is Parrot.     - Jackal has already been identified.     - Giraffe and Lion can be differentiated based on their truthfulness and the mechanism of delayed truth. 6.

Given there are ( 2^n - 1 ) possible non-empty subsets, the number will thus be repainted an odd number of times. Consequently, these numbers will undergo an actual color change.    - Conversely, a number that is not a multiple of at least one of the primes will not be affected in the repainting corresponding to subsets including that prime, leaving it unrepainted overall. 3. **Executing the first method:**    - If a number ( k ) does not divide into one of the primes in our set (say ( p_1 )), it won’t be repainted when we repaint based on numbers not relatively prime to ( p_1 ).     - By applying the repainting operations for all products of sets of primes whose product is at most 1,000,000, every number ( k ) having ( m ) distinct prime factors will be repainted ( 2^m - 1 ) times, which is an odd number (ensuring a color change from black). 4. **Executing the second method:**    - Define two numbers as equivalent if they have the same set of prime divisors.    - Notice that our repainting operations will affect whole equivalence classes of such numbers at once.    - Initiate by repainting the minimal classes (where a class is minimal if it’s not larger than any other class).    - Once a class has been repainted, exclude it from further consideration and repeat the process for remaining classes until none are left. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Given the finite number of classes, eventually, all numbers will be repainted through these operations.    - Therefore, it is possible to end up with all numbers being repainted to white starting from black.

By the definition of a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to its distance to the directrix. So, |MF|=x+frac{p}{2}=x+2=20, hence, x=18. Thus, the answer is: boxed{18}. To elaborate on the solution, by using the property of parabola, we know that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to its distance to the directrix. Given that |MF|=20, we can conclude that the distance from point M to the directrix is also 20. This implies that |MF|=x+frac{p}{2}=x+2=20. Solving this equation for x, we find that x=18. Utilizing the definition of a parabola is one of the most fundamental methods to tackle problems related to parabolas. The distance from a point on a parabola to its focus is called the focal radius.

For an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. For this ellipse, that constant sum is 2a, where a is the semi-major axis. Given the equation frac{x^2}{9} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1, we identify a = 3, so 2a = 6. Therefore, we have |MF_1| + |MF_2| = 6. 2.

A unit base triangle is a triangle with a base of length 1 and height such that the area is an integer.

Given that 2009 is one more than a multiple of 4, we can deduce that the ones digit of n^{2009} is the same as the ones digit of n for any positive integer n.

Therefore, if Brother B is actually Vasya, he would say \\"No\\" (he lies that he's not Vasya). If Brother B is Vanya, he would also say \\"No\\" (he lies that he's not Vanya, but says no anyway because he never tells the truth).      - Hence, Brother A's truthful answer to \\"What would your brother respond to 'Are you Vasya?'\\" would be \\"No\\".    - **If we ask Brother B (the liar)**:      - Brother B, who lies, knows Brother A would give a truthful answer.      - If Brother A, who is honest, is asked \\"Are you Vasya?\\", he would respond truthfully.       - If Brother A is Vasya, he would say \\"Yes\\". If Brother A is Vanya, he would say \\"No\\".      - But Brother B will lie about what Brother A would truthfully say. Therefore:        - If Brother A is Vasya, Brother B (lying) would say \\"No\\".        - If Brother A is Vanya, Brother B (lying) would say \\"Yes\\". 4. **Interpret the answer**:    Regardless of who we ask:    - If the answer is \\"No\\", that means the one you are asking is not Vasya (as in both cases, the response corresponds to a \\"No\\" if the answer should be negative for the next step logic).    - If the answer is \\"Yes\\", it immediately refers to a lie structure, which could hint the current person isn't truth-teller, thus resolving who we asked in chances clearly. # Practical Execution: Ask any brother: \\"What would your brother say if asked 'Are you Vasya?'\\" - If the response is \\"No\\": The brother you were questioning is Vasya. - If the response is \\"Yes\\": The brother you were questioning is Vanya.

We need to show that:    [    frac{prod_{i=1}^n (c_{m+i} - c_k)}{n!(n+1)!}    ]    is an integer. 7. Using the expression for ( c_{m+i} - c_k ), we have:    [    prod_{i=1}^n (c_{m+i} - c_k) = prod_{i=1}^n (m+i-k)(m+i+k+1)    ] 8. We can split this product into two parts:    [    prod_{i=1}^n (m+i-k) cdot prod_{i=1}^n (m+i+k+1)    ] 9. Consider the first product:    [    prod_{i=1}^n (m+i-k) = frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-k)!}    ] 10. Consider the second product:     [     prod_{i=1}^n (m+i+k+1) = frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k+1)!}     ] 11. Combining these, we get:     [     prod_{i=1}^n (c_{m+i} - c_k) = frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-k)!} cdot frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k+1)!}     ] 12. We need to show that:     [     frac{frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-k)!} cdot frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k+1)!}}{n!(n+1)!}     ]     is an integer. 13. Simplifying, we get:     [     frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-k)!n!} cdot frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k+1)!(n+1)!}     ] 14. The first term:     [     frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-k)!n!} = binom{m+n-k}{n}     ]     is an integer. 15. The second term:     [     frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k+1)!(n+1)!} = binom{m+n+k+1}{n+1}     ]     is an integer. 16. Since ( m+k+1 ) is a prime greater than ( n+1 ), it does not divide ( (n+1)! ) or ( (m+n)! ), ensuring that the entire expression is an integer. Therefore, the product ((c_{m+1} - c_k)(c_{m+2} - c_k) ldots (c_{m+n} - c_k)) is divisible by ( c_1 c_2 ldots c_n ).

For a hyperbola of this form, the eccentricity e is given by e = sqrt{1 + frac{a^2}{b^2}}. The right focus of the hyperbola is at (c, 0), where c = eb. The given parabola y^2 = 16x has its focus at (4, 0), since the focus of a parabola y^2 = 4ax is at (a, 0). Since the right focus of the hyperbola coincides with the focus of the parabola, we have c = 4. Therefore, eb = 4. For the parabola y^2 = 16x, the parameter a = 4. Thus, the distance from the vertex to the focus is 4, which matches the distance from the origin to the focus of the hyperbola. Given that the hyperbola's right focus coincides with the parabola's focus, and considering the relationship between e, a, and b, we can deduce that e = sqrt{1 + frac{a^2}{b^2}} must satisfy the condition for the hyperbola's focus to be at (4, 0).

Thus, we are interested in the number of ways to divide these n points with a straight line. 2. **Use of a Central Point for Polar Coordinates:**    Consider a point O in the plane that does not lie on any of the lines formed by connecting any two of the given points. We can use this point O as the center for a polar coordinate system. Each of the n points corresponds to a unique line through O, and no two lines are parallel, and no three lines intersect at O. 3. **Number of Regions Formed by n Lines:**    According to a theorem known from combinatorial geometry, n lines in general position (no two parallel, no three concurrent) divide the plane into:    [    frac{1}{2} n(n + 1) + 1    ]    regions. Out of these, there are 2n unbounded regions. 4. **Lemma – Behavior of Polar Division:**    If we have two points A and B, the area around the line AB is divided into four angles. The poles of lines intersecting segment AB lie in two of these angles, and the poles of lines not intersecting AB lie in the other two angles. Each such division corresponds to a unique way to separate the set of points. 5. **Application of the Lemma to Unbounded Regions:**    From the lemma, we conclude that each of the 2n unbounded regions corresponds to a unique way to partition the set of points into two subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls. 6. **Counting Valid Partitions:**    We need to count the ways that divide the set of points by choosing a pair {P, Q} such that no points are exactly on the dividing line. Given n points, the choosing pairs excluding the case where all points lie on one side (which is forbidden as both sets must be non-empty), we get:    [    text{Number of valid partitions} =  frac{1}{2} n (n - 1)    ]    This follows because every pair of points defines a line that contributes to valid partitions, considering symmetry where (P, Q) and (Q, P) represent the same partition case. # Conclusion: Thus, the number of ways to partition the set of n points into two subsets such that the convex hulls do not intersect is given by: [ boxed{frac{1}{2} n (n - 1)} ]"},{"instruction":"What is the perimeter of pentagon FGHIJ in this diagram?

Using the known trigonometric identity for side lengths in terms of the circumradius R, we have:    [    PA = 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right)    ]    [    PB = 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right)    ]    [    PC = 2R sin theta    ] 3. To find PA cdot PB cdot PC, we multiply these lengths:    [    PA cdot PB cdot PC = left( 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) right) cdot left( 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) right) cdot left( 2R sin theta right)    ] 4. Simplifying the expression:    [    PA cdot PB cdot PC = 4R^2 sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) cdot 2R sin theta    ] 5. Using the product-to-sum identity:    [    sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) = frac{1}{2} left[ cos left( 2theta right) - cos left( frac{2pi}{3} right) right]    ] 6. Thus, the expression becomes:    [    PA cdot PB cdot PC = 4R^2 cdot frac{1}{2} left( cos 2theta - cos frac{2pi}{3} right) cdot 2R sin theta    ] 7. Recall that cos frac{2pi}{3} = -frac{1}{2}, so:    [    PA cdot PB cdot PC = 4R^3 left( cos 2theta + frac{1}{2} right) sin theta    ] 8. It’s known that the maximum value of the expression left( cos 2theta + frac{1}{2} right) leq 1 due to trigonometric limits. Therefore:    [    PA cdot PB cdot PC leq 4R^3 cdot 0.5 = 2R^3    ] 9. The equality holds when theta = frac{pi}{6} (i.e., cos 2 times frac{pi}{6} = cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2}). Hence, we have shown: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC leq 2R^3 ]  Part (2) 1. Let's express the sum PA + PB + PC again in terms of theta:    [    PA + PB + PC = 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) + 2R sin theta    ] 2. Using the trigonometric sum-to-product identities, we have:    [    PA + PB + PC = 2R left( sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) right) + 2R sin theta     ] 3. The sum sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) can be expressed using the identity sin A + sin B = 2 sin left( frac{A + B}{2} right) cos left( frac{A - B}{2} right):    [    sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) = 2 sin left( frac{pi}{3} right) cos theta    ] 4. Therefore:    [    PA + PB + PC = 2R cdot 2 sin frac{pi}{3} cos theta + 2R sin theta    ] 5. Using sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} we get:    [    PA + PB + PC = 4R cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos theta + 2R sin theta    ]    [    = 2R sqrt{3} cos theta + 2R sin theta    ] 6. We could rewrite it further in a sum form:     [    PA + PB + PC = 2R (sqrt{3} cos theta + sin theta)    ] 7. Utilize the cosine addition identity to simplify the expression:    [    cos left( theta - frac{pi}{6} right) = cos theta cos frac{pi}{6} + sin theta sin frac{pi}{6}    ]    Since cos frac{pi}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} and sin frac{pi}{6} = frac{1}{2}:    [    cos left( theta - frac{pi}{6} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos theta + frac{1}{2} sin theta    ] 8. Hence, this provides us a sum limit:    [    PA + PB + PC leq 4R    ] So, we have demonstrated: [ PA + PB + PC leq 4R ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{PA cdot PB cdot PC leq 2R^3 quad text{and} quad PA + PB + PC leq 4R} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ((X, mathscr{X}, mu)) be a measurable space ((X, mathscr{X})) with a countably additive measure (mu), where (mathscr{X}) is a given (sigma)algebra of subsets of (X).

A measure (mu) is called atomic if every measurable set of positive (mu)measure contains an atom. A measure (mu) is called nonatomic if there are no (mu)atoms. Provide examples of atomic, nonatomic, diffuse measures, and an example of a measure that is both atomic and diffuse. Show that the sum of an atomic measure and a nonatomic measure can be atomic.","output":"1. **Identifying Diffuse and Non-Atomic Measures:**    The Lebesgue measure (lambda) on ((mathbb{R}, mathscr{B}(mathbb{R}))) is known as both diffuse and non-atomic. Diffuse means the measure assigns a positive measure only to sets of infinite cardinality. Non-atomic means there are no atoms, i.e., for any measurable set (A) with (lambda(A) > 0), there exists a subset (B subseteq A) such that (0 < lambda(B) < lambda(A)). 2. **Identifying Atomic Measures:**    Consider a measure (mu) on ((mathbb{R}, mathscr{B}(mathbb{R}))) defined by:            mu(B) = I([0,1] subseteq B) quad text{for } B in mathscr{B}(mathbb{R})            This measure is atomic with the interval ([0,1]) being the (mu)-atom. The measure (mu) assigns a measure of 1 to any set that includes ([0,1]) and 0 otherwise. This is a combination of both atomic and diffuse properties:        - It is atomic because ([0,1]) is an indivisible set with positive measure.    - It is diffuse in the sense that outside [0,1] it does not contribute to the measure. 3. **Combining Atomic and Non-Atomic Measures to Get an Atomic Measure:**    **Note:** It is established that each finite measure (mu) can be decomposed into a sum of an atomic measure (mu_a) and a non-atomic measure (mu_c). This explanation includes the measure decomposition, where:            mu = mu_a + mu_c        Let's use the example of the sum of two measures, specifically the Lebesgue measure (lambda) (non-atomic) and a counting measure (nu) (atomic). 4. **Constructing the Sum:**    Let (nu) be a counting measure that assigns a measure (1) to each singleton, i.e., (nu({x}) = 1) for any (x in mathbb{R}).    Then consider a measure (eta) defined by:        eta = lambda + nu     5. **Verifying the Properties:**    - **Atomic:** Every individual point can be considered as an atom under (nu), because (nu({x}) = 1).    - **Non-Atomic:** The Lebesgue measure (lambda) ensures that between any points, there is a continuous distribution with no individual atoms. 6. **Conclusion:**    The measure (eta) is an example of a measure that is the sum of an atomic measure and a non-atomic measure, and such a sum may still be atomic because it includes the counting measure component which has atoms. Therefore, (eta) is atomic. (boxed{})"},{"instruction":"Given the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_1=frac{1}{4}, and a_n=frac{a_{n1}}{(1)^n a_{n1}2} (ngeqslant 2,nin N^*).

Each pair of points can be connected by a line segment. The total number of line segments is given by:    [    binom{2n}{2} = frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = n(2n-1)    ] 2. **Hypothesis**: Suppose out of these (n(2n-1)) segments, we color (n^2+1) of them red. We need to show that at least (n) triangles with all sides red (red triangles) exist. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**:     - Assume that there is no red triangle.     - Focus on a point (A). Let the number of red segments from (A) be denoted by (d(A)).     - Without loss of generality, suppose (d(A)) is maximum among all points. 4. **Vertex Degree**:     - Let (A B_1, A B_2, ldots, A B_k) be the red segments originating from (A). Here (k geq n+1) because if each point is connected to at least (n+1) others, it's bound to create multiple red triangles unless we assume above. 5. **Two Case Analysis**:    - **Case 1**: If any two of (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k) are connected by a red segment, let's say (B_1 B_2), then (triangle A B_1 B_2) forms a red triangle, contradicting our assumption.        - **Case 2**: Suppose no red line segments exist between (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k). Then from each point (B_i  (i=1,2, ldots, k)), there are at most (2n-k) red segments because the maximum possibilities for such pair-connections are diminished by their absence between them.          - The total maximum number of red segments, in this case, would be bound by:          [          sum_{i=1}^k d(B_i) leq k(2n-k)          ]          Taking (k geq n+1), we have:          [          k(2n-k) leq n^2          ]          But we know there are (n^2 + 1) red segments, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, case 2 is impossible. 6. **Existence of Red Triangles**:     - At least one red triangle must exist considering more of (k) if not more connecting between those points (B_i). 7. **Proof by Induction**:     - **Base Case (n = 2)**:       - Assume four points (A, B, C, D). If we are to color 5 red out of these 6 possible segments and excluding only one, then it forces creating at least two red triangles by Pigeonhole principle.     - **Inductive Step**:       - Assume the hypothesis is true for (n = k): i.e., (2k) points form at least (k) red triangles.       - For (n = k+1), (2k+2) points where red segments sum up ((k+1)^2 + 1):         - Given connections (d(B), ldots, d(C)) again repeating the counting principle shows:         (triangle ABC) red must include inherently if not, surpassing (3k+5) for contradiction re-evaluates maintaining at least (k+1) triangles. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, by the process connected, we see at least (n)-red triangles exist for assumed conditions as (n=k+1) holds true reflecting inductive step completion confirming the general hypothesis is valid.

The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), gives the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve. Since f'(x) = e^x, the slope of the tangent at (t, e^t) is e^t.    The equation of the tangent line at this point can be written as:    [    y - e^t = e^t(x - t)    ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    y = e^t x + (1 - t)e^t quad text{(1)}    ] 2. **Finding the Tangent Line to g(x) = ln x + 2:**    The derivative of g(x), denoted as g'(x), is frac{1}{x}. For the line to be a common tangent, its slope must equal the slope of the tangent to f(x) at (t, e^t), which is e^t.

Therefore, if ( A ) and ( B ) are connected, then ( B ) and ( C ) are not connected, and vice versa. 3. **Pairing of Towns:**    This condition implies that any set of consecutive towns will be divided into pairs such that if ( A ) and ( B ) are connected, there will be no connection from ( B ) to the next town ( C ).

Let's explore what happens if we have fewer than 8 liars. 4. **Contradiction and Minimum Liars:**    - If there are fewer than 8 liars, at least one group of 8 individuals would be composed entirely of truth-tellers.    - If all members of a group are truth-tellers, then their statement (that neighbors are from both parties) must be true. But since this cannot happen (all neighbors can't be from both parties), we reach a contradiction.    - Therefore, the number of liars must be at least 8. 5. **Feasibility at 8 Liars:**    - We will consider arranging exactly 8 liars in such a way to satisfy the problem's requirements.     - Place one liar in each row ensuring that every liar's neighbors include at least one truth-teller.

Then diagonally opposite squares 2, 4, 6, and 8 cannot all be empty simultaneously because their paired domino covers will also be placed. 7. **Consequence of 9 being empty**      Since placing a domino horizontally or vertically from 9 covers two squares of those numbered 1 to 8, it results in covered squares such that at most three squares can remain uncovered in the 3 times 3 grid. This leads to a contradiction since we need uncovered spaces to be greater than 4. 8. **Case 2 - Center square (9) is covered**      If 9 is covered, the domino covering 9 must also cover one adjacent square. This placement splits into two subcases:    - If the domino covers squares 8 and 9 (or equivalently squares 2 and 9), then at least four of the other squares 1, 3, 5, 7, must be uncovered. Consequently, squares indexed as 2, possibly another set 4, 6 remains uncovered, which allows for at least 1, 2 as openings.    - Alternatively, if the domino covers squares 6 and 9 (or equivalently squares 4 and 9), the same analysis applies.

By definition of parallel lines, if ( m_{1} parallel l ), any point on ( m_{1} ) does not lie on ( l ). 3. Similarly, if ( m_{2} parallel l ), any point on ( m_{2} ) also does not lie on ( l ). 4. Now, if ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) intersect at point ( X ), this means through ( X ), there are two different lines ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) that are both parallel to ( l ). 5. However, from the Euclidean geometry, through any given point, there can be only one line parallel to another given line. This contradiction implies that ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) cannot intersect at any point ( X ) unless they are the same line. Thus, ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) must be parallel to each other. Hence, if two lines are parallel to a third line, they are parallel to each other.  Second Variant: Consider three lines ( l ), ( m_{1} ), and ( m_{2} ).

Because ( l parallel m_{1} ), alternate interior angles formed are equal, so ( alpha = gamma ). 3. Similarly, because ( l parallel m_{2} ), alternate interior angles formed are equal, so ( alpha = beta ). 4. Since ( alpha = gamma ) and ( alpha = beta ), it follows that (beta = gamma). 5. By definition of parallel lines, if the corresponding angles are equal, the lines must be parallel. Therefore, lines ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) are parallel due to (beta = gamma).

In total, these are 8 red balls, creating 8+1=9 gaps between and around the red balls. 2. **Choosing Gaps for Blue Balls**: Using the combinatorial formula {y-x+1 choose x} where y is the total gaps and x is blue balls, we calculate {9 choose 9} = 1 way to place the blue balls such that no two are adjacent. 3. **Dividing into Jars**: We introduce an extra red ball as a hypothetical divider, giving us 8+1=9 potential dividers. We choose any of these as the divider, giving 9 different ways to divide the string of balls into two jars. 4. **Excluding Cases**: Exclude cases where jars might be empty.

Since this circle is inscribed around triangle ( AKC ):     [     sin angle AKC = frac{AC}{2R} = frac{5sqrt{3}}{10} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}     ]     Therefore, ( angle MKL = angle AKC = 60^circ ), since ( sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). 5. **Verification**:     The angle ( angle MKL ) could be 60° or 120°. However, we verify that the possibility of ( angle MKL = 120^circ ) leads to contradictions:     If ( angle MKL = 120^circ ), the arc ( ABC ) would be 240°, making the distance from point ( K ) to line ( AC ) less than from point ( B ), contradicting ( frac{KA}{AL} = frac{5}{4} ). 6. **Area Calculation**:     Let ( KC = 5b ) and ( CM = 4b ).

Operation ( B ) erases two numbers from the blackboard and replaces them with their sum. Continue this process until after one application of operation ( B ), only one nonnegative number remains on the blackboard. What is this number?","output":"1. The operations A and B are applied alternately on the numbers written on the blackboard, starting with operation A.      Operation A subtracts a natural number from each number on the blackboard. Operation B erases two numbers and writes their sum.     2. Each pair of A and B operations will reduce the total count of numbers on the blackboard by 1. Consequently, after 1987 pairs of operations (1987 applications of A and 1987 applications of B), the number of numbers on the blackboard will be reduced to 1. 3. Let d_k be the number subtracted in the k-th A operation, where k=1, 2, ldots, 1987. 4. Initially, the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1988 is:        sum_{k=1}^{1988} k = frac{1988 cdot 1989}{2}     5. After each k-th A operation, the sum of the numbers on the blackboard decreases by (1989-k) d_k. The reason is that if each number on the blackboard is decreased by d_k, there are (1989-k) numbers left after k operations. 6. After 1987 operations of A, the sum of the numbers remaining on the blackboard can be written as:        frac{1988 cdot 1989}{2} - sum_{k=1}^{1987} (1989-k) d_k     7. Since operation B does not change the overall sum but only decreases the count of numbers, the critical part of our analysis revolves around ensuring the sum reduction does not exceed the scope intended by the problem (i.e., maintaining a non-negative sum): 8. For the sum to remain non-negative post all A operations and B operations, consider:        (1989 - k)(1 - d_k) leq 0 quad text{for all}  k=1, 2, ldots, 1987        This implies 1 - d_k leq 0, and hence d_k geq 1. 9. If for any k, d_k geq 2, then:        (1989 - k)(1 - d_k) leq -2     10. This condition results in:        x leq (1989 - k)(1 - d_k) + left(text{remaining terms}right) leq -1        which is a contradiction because the number left on the blackboard should be non-negative. 11. Therefore, d_k = 1 for all k = 1, 2, ldots, 1987, limiting all subtractions effectively to 1 per each step when considering the total operation sum adjustments. 12.

Steps:    - Mirroring makes an equilateral triangle SA'S with angle ASA' = 120^circ.    - The line segment AA' spans across two sides of these triangles thus must be computed:         [         AA' = 2 cdot (SA cdot sin(60^circ)) = 2 cdot (4 cdot sin(60^circ)) = 2 cdot (4 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) = 4sqrt{3}         ] 4. **Spatial Relations and Perimeter Calculation:**          Since each of the edges E, F, and G lie on one of SB, SC, and SD respectively, and considering that line segment AA' essentially breaks into equal symmetric portions, the total perimeter is minimized by the nature symmetry and minimal high:    Thus perimeter calculation involves minimum transverse lengths (of neighbors):          The key here:     - Edge Symmetric details may span each involving triangle edges aligned uniformly.

For the Ferris wheel: Dolly wants to ride it twice, and it costs 2 tickets per ride. So, 2 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 4 tickets for the Ferris wheel. For the log ride: Dolly wants to ride it seven times, and it costs 1 ticket per ride. So, 7 rides * 1 ticket/ride = 7 tickets for the log ride. Now, let's add the tickets needed for the Ferris wheel and the log ride: 4 tickets (Ferris wheel) + 7 tickets (log ride) = 11 tickets. Dolly has 20 tickets and needs to buy 6 more, which means she needs a total of: 20 tickets + 6 tickets = 26 tickets. Since we know she needs 11 tickets for the Ferris wheel and the log ride, we can subtract that from the total number of tickets she needs to find out how many tickets the roller coaster rides will cost: 26 tickets (total needed) - 11 tickets (Ferris wheel and log ride) = 15 tickets for the roller coaster.

The height of the triangles from C to R is 10 (half-height of prism).  The area for each is frac{1}{2} left(frac{5sqrt{3}}{3}right)(10) = frac{25sqrt{3}}{3}. **Area of triangle CPQ:** Since PQ is parallel to AB and each point is one-third along its edge, PQ = frac{10}{3}.

To proceed, we need to find a lower bound for ( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i ). We claim that ( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i geq frac{n}{sqrt{n}} ). 4. To prove this claim, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the functions:    [    f(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i    ]    [    g(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - 1    ]    and the Lagrangian:    [    L = f(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) - lambda g(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n)    ] 5.

When the article is sold for 780.50, the gain is 15% more, which means the gain is G + 0.15G = 1.15G.

From condition ②, because f(x + 4) = -f(x), this implies that f(x + 8) = -f(x + 4) = f(x), indicating that the function f(x) is periodic with a period of 8. With condition ③, y = f(x + 4) being an even function reflects that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the vertical line x = -4. Considering the periodicity from condition ②, the graph of f(x) is also symmetric about the vertical line x = 4. Now let's determine the values of a, b, and c using the given information: - a = f(6): This value lies within the interval [4, 8].    - b = f(11): Using the periodicity property, f(11) = f(11 - 8) = f(3).

Since the month starts on a Sunday and has 30 days, there will be: - 5 Sundays (1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th) - 25 other days (Monday to Saturday) Now, we calculate the total number of visitors for Sundays and other days: Total visitors on Sundays = 5 Sundays * 660 visitors per Sunday Total visitors on Sundays = 3300 visitors Total visitors on other days = 25 days * 240 visitors per day Total visitors on other days = 6000 visitors Now, we add the total visitors on Sundays and other days to get the total visitors for the month: Total visitors for the month = Total visitors on Sundays + Total visitors on other days Total visitors for the month = 3300 visitors + 6000 visitors Total visitors for the month = 9300 visitors Finally, we find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total visitors for the month by the number of days in the month: Average visitors per day = Total visitors for the month / Number of days in the month Average visitors per day = 9300 visitors / 30 days Average visitors per day = 310 visitors per day Therefore, the average number of visitors per day in a month of 30 days beginning with a Sunday is boxed{310} ."},{"instruction":"Let omega(n) represent the number of distinct prime factors of a natural number n (where n > 1).

By taking the reciprocal on both sides and simplifying, we find that {frac{1}{a_{n}} + frac{1}{2}} is a geometric sequence, from which we derive the general term formula for {a_{n}}. This problem primarily tests the ability to convert between functions and sequences, and the key to solving it is to use the abstract relationship of the function combined with the definition of monotonicity to determine the function's monotonicity.

Therefore, the LCM of d and n must include the prime factors of n (2, 5, and 23) and any prime factors of d that are not already included in n.

There are 101 such vertices. 4. **Vertex Coverage**:    - Observe that any shortest broken line that meets the problem’s criteria will follow paths that pass through each vertex exactly once.    - Specifically, each path can be visualized to be composed of segments that step one unit right or one unit down. Consequently, they visit each diagonal of the grid exactly. 5. **Vertex Count on Diagonals**:    - Since the grid is 100 times 100, the broken lines visiting each diagonal must pass through sequences such as  (i, i) where i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 100.  6. **Broken Lines Requirement Calculation**:    - To cover all vertices of a 100 times 100 grid, broken lines need to pass through each vertex exactly once.    - Given that each broken line starts at one corner and extends to another, and no single broken line can overlap in the same set of x or y coordinates apart from in the start-to-end line, there must exist a minimal number that ensures all 101 vertices along the diagonal are covered. 7. **Overlap and Inevitability of Multiple Lines**:    - Each line must cover unique vertices except possibly endpoints. Given our constraints and required coverage, the minimal number of lines must thus prevent any missed vertices. 8. **Validation of Minimum Number**:    - Evaluations above with shortest connections enforcing exclusive coverage per line’s trajectory indicate that no such broken line can share its primary diagonal vertex (i = 0 to i = 100, where primary diagonal relationship sustains) with another.    - Thus, simplifying to requirement entropy and coverage minimally indicates 101 lines are required. # Conclusion: To cover all vertices of a 100 times 100 grid considering the arrangement and vertex requirement, a minimum of  [ boxed{101} ] broken lines are necessary."},{"instruction":"a sixdigit number, any 3 consecutive digits form a threedigit number that is divisible by either 6 or 7.

Steps: 1. **Step 1: Determine the Form of ( n )**     - The last digit of ( n^3 ) is 8, so ( n ) itself must end in 2.     - Represent ( n ) as ( n = 10k + 2 ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. 2. **Step 2: Expression for ( n^3 )**     - Expand the cube of ( n ) using the binomial theorem:       [       begin{aligned}       n^3 &= (10k + 2)^3        &= 1000k^3 + 3 cdot 100k^2 cdot 2 + 3 cdot 10k cdot 4 + 8        &= 1000k^3 + 600k^2 + 120k + 8       end{aligned}       ] 3. **Step 3: Analyze Last Three Digits**     - The last three digits of ( n^3 ) are determined primarily by ( 120k + 8 ) since ( 1000k^3 ) and ( 600k^2 ) contribute zeros to the last three digits of ( n^3 ). 4. **Step 4: Set Last Three Digits Condition**     - We need the last three digits ( 120k + 8 ) to end with 888.

We need to prove that there is a unique point ( X_{1} ) on the line ( l_{1} ) such that after ( n ) projections:      [      X_{1} xrightarrow{p_{1}} X_{2} xrightarrow{p_{2}} dots xrightarrow{p_{n-1}} X_{n} xrightarrow{p_{n}} X_{1}      ]      ( X_{1} ) maps to itself. 3. **Function Composition:**    - Define the composition of functions:      [      f = p_{1} circ p_{2} circ ldots circ p_{n}      ]    - We need to show that ( f(X_1) = X_1 ) has a unique solution for ( X_1 ) on ( l_1 ). 4. **Coordinate System Setup:**    - Choose an origin and a direction on each line ( l_{i} ), effectively converting each line into a number line with a chosen unit scale (identical on all lines). This setup allows us to treat points and projections ( p_{i} ) mathematically as functions that map numbers to numbers. 5. **Uniqueness of the Fixed Point:**    - Since each ( l_{i} ) is a line, the functions ( p_{i} ) are linear transformations. Thus, the composition ( f ) is also a linear function. The problem now is to show that this function has a unique fixed point. 6. **Linear Properties and Fixed Point Analysis:**    - In a plane, a sequence of orthogonal projections onto lines would yield a linear transformation. Let's denote this transformation as:      [      f(x) = ax + b      ]      where ( a ) and ( b ) are constants. A fixed point ( x ) meets the condition:      [      f(x) = x implies ax + b = x implies (a-1)x + b = 0      ] 7. **Solving for the Fixed Point:**    - Solve for ( x ):      [      x = frac{-b}{a-1}      ]      This ( x ) exists if ( a neq 1 ). However, if some lines are not parallel, the composed function ( f ) does not degenerate, ensuring ( a neq 1 ). 8. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of the point ( X_1 ) on ( l_1 ) that maps to itself after the series of projections are guaranteed.

We can rewrite the sequence term as: a_n = frac{n - sqrt{98}}{n - sqrt{99}} = 1 + frac{sqrt{99} - sqrt{98}}{n - sqrt{99}}. To find the largest and smallest terms, let's analyze the sequence behavior for different values of n. 1. When 1 leq n leq 9, we have:    The denominator n - sqrt{99} is negative since sqrt{99} > n for these values of n. Thus, the fraction frac{sqrt{99} - sqrt{98}}{n - sqrt{99}} is negative, and a_n decreases as n increases. The smallest term in this interval will be a_9 as it is less than 1. 2. When 10 leq n leq 30, we have:    The denominator n - sqrt{99} is positive as sqrt{99} < n for these values of n. Therefore, the fraction frac{sqrt{99} - sqrt{98}}{n - sqrt{99}} is positive, and a_n still decreases as n increases because the denominator gets larger while the numerator remains constant. The largest term in this interval is a_{10} since it is the first term greater than 1. Based on the analysis, the largest and smallest terms among the first 30 terms are a_{10} and a_9, respectively.

Here, AB is constant but the height varies as the vertical distance from P to line AB changes due to the circular path.    - therefore The area of triangle PAB changes. 4. **Area of trapezoid ABNM:**    - The bases AB and MN are constant, but the height, the vertical distance between AB and MN, changes because P's motion alters the mid-segment MN's relative height.    - therefore The area of trapezoid ABNM changes. From this analysis, only the length of MN remains unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is textbf{(D) 3}.

The total number of mice after the second round of pups and the eating of some pups is the sum of the adult mice and the remaining pups: 8 + 8P + (8 + 8P) * 6 - 2 * (8 + 8P).

Since the sequence is strictly increasing and ( f(2) = 2 ). 2. **Bounding ( f(3) ):**    - We are given ( f(3 cdot 7) = f(21) < f(22) = f(2 cdot 11) = 2 cdot f(11) ).    - Also, we have ( 2 cdot f(11) < 2 cdot f(14) = 2 cdot f(2 cdot 7) = 4 cdot f(7) ).    - Therefore, ( f(21) < 4 cdot f(7) ). 3. **Checking for ( f(3) ):**    - Since ( f(3 cdot 7) = f(3) cdot f(7) ) and ( f(2 cdot 3) = f(6) = f(2) cdot f(3) ).  4.

There are (8) rows and (8) columns on the chessboard, resulting in a grid structure we must consider. 4. **Counting Intersections:**    The exact number of cells intersected by the line is determined by how many times it intersects the horizontal and vertical boundaries. 5. **Maximum Intersections:**    Consider the properties of grid lines and intersections:    - A line cutting through the chessboard from one corner to the opposite corner can potentially cross ( 2 times 8 - 1 = 15 ) cells at most. To see why, imagine the line crossing into each new row and column as it progresses diagonally. Each time it enters a new row or column, it hits an additional cell. 6. **Theoretical Justification:**    To elaborate further, note that the line crosses cells' boundaries. There are (8-1=7) vertical lines and (8-1=7) horizontal lines, making it possible for a line to intersect up to (7+7=14) internal cell boundaries.    - Additionally, the line will cross two edges of the chessboard at the boundary, bringing the total number of intersected boundaries to (14 + 2 = 16).    - The maximum number of cells will be one less than the number of intersection points on cell boundaries because each time it crosses a boundary; it enters a new cell. 7. **Concluding the Number of Cells:**    Given that the theoretical maximum for a straight line intersecting a finite grid is (15) cells, the optimal crossing of such a line on an 8x8 chessboard concurs with our theoretical upward boundary.

Let's solve the problem step by step: 1. **Identify the Focus of the Parabola**: The standard form of a parabola y^2 = 4ax tells us that its focus is at (a,0). Given C:y^{2}=4x, we have 4a = 4, so a = 1. Therefore, the focus F is at (1,0), or F(1,0). 2. **Equation of the Directrix**: The directrix of a parabola y^2 = 4ax is a vertical line x = -a.

However, considering the context and the formula used, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the calculation of |AF| directly from the properties of the parabola. The correct approach involves using the definition of the parabola and the distance formula if needed. Since A lies on the parabola, its coordinates satisfy y^2 = 4x.

However, the direct calculation of |AF| as 3 + 1 = 4 seems to be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the steps involved.

In plane geometry, two distinct lines that are both perpendicular to a third line cannot intersect each other. Thus, by definition, they are parallel. 2. In solid geometry, if we attempt to transpose this property, our intuition might lead us to say that if two planes are both perpendicular to a third plane, they, too, should be parallel — meaning they should not intersect each other. 3. However, this direct analogy from line to plane does not hold true in solid geometry. Two planes can be perpendicular to the same plane and yet intersect each other along a line. A counterexample can illustrate this: Imagine two walls (planes) meeting at a corner, both are perpendicular to the floor (plane).

He started with 40 and spent 19, so he has 40 - 19 = 21 left. Dave started with 50 and spent 7 on lunch for his mom, so he has 50 - 7 = 43 left.

A geometric progression (GP) in ( mathbb{Z} / m mathbb{Z} ) takes the form:    [    b, br, br^2, ldots (bmod m)    ]    for some initial term ( b ) and common ratio ( r ). 2. **Combine the Properties**:    For a sequence to be both an AP and a GP, it must satisfy both forms. Suppose such a sequence is given by:    [    a, a + d, a + 2d, ldots (bmod m)    ]    and also:    [    b, br, br^2, ldots (bmod m).    ]    This implies:    [    a = b, quad a + d = br, quad a + 2d = br^2, ldots    ] 3. **Analyze the Equality**:    For the arithmetic progression to match the geometric progression, the common difference ( d ) and the common ratio ( r ) must be related. Consider:    [    a + d = br = a cdot r    ]    This yields:    [    d = a(r - 1)    ]    Similarly for the second term:    [    a + 2d = br^2    ]    This gives:    [    a + 2a(r - 1) = a cdot r^2 implies a(1 + 2(r - 1)) = a cdot r^2    ]    Simplify:    [    1 + 2r - 2 = r^2 implies r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0 implies (r - 1)^2 = 0 implies r = 1.    ]    If ( r = 1 ), then ( d = a(r - 1) = 0 ). This means the sequence would be constant, which contradicts the nonconstant requirement. Therefore, ( a neq 0 ). 4. **Consider ( m ) and Divisibility**:    To find when nonconstant solutions exist, consider when ( m ) is not squarefree.    - **Squarefree ( m )**: If ( m ) is squarefree, it has no repeated prime factor. Then, for any arithmetic progression ((s - d, s, s + d)), to be geometric, the condition ( d^{2} equiv (s - d)(s + d) equiv s^2 - d^2 pmod{m} ) must hold. Simplifying, we get ( d^2 equiv 0 pmod{m} ), implying that ( d equiv 0 pmod{m} ). Thus, the sequence cannot be nonconstant.    - **Non-Squarefree ( m )**: If ( p^2 mid m ) for some prime ( p ), consider the common difference ( d = m / p ). Since ( p cdot d = m ), ( d ) is not zero modulo ( m ), allowing nonconstant arithmetic-geometric progressions. # Conclusion: For the sequence to be both an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression yet nonconstant, ( m ) must not be squarefree.

Let's analyze the situation step-by-step by considering the possible identities of resident A.  Case 1: A is a Knight 1. If (A) is a knight, then (A) always tells the truth. 2. (A) says, \\"B is a knight,\\" so (B) must be a knight. 3. Since (B) is a knight, (B) always tells the truth. 4. However, (B) says, \\"A is a liar,\\" which contradicts the assumption that (A) is a knight. 5. Therefore, (A) cannot be a knight.  Case 2: A is a Liar 1. If (A) is a liar, then (A) always lies. 2. (A) says, \\"B is a knight,\\" which must be a lie. 3. Therefore, (B) is not a knight. 4. Since (B) is not a knight, (B) could be either a liar or a normal person.    - If (B) is a liar, then (B) always lies, which would make the statement \\"A is a liar\\" true and contradict the notion that a liar always lies.    - If (B) is a normal person, (B) can either lie or tell the truth.      - If (B) lies, then \\"A is a liar\\" is false, which matches our initial assumption that (A) is a liar.      - If (B) tells the truth, then \\"A is a liar\\" is true, which aligns with the notion that (A) is indeed a liar. Hence, either scenario confirms that (B) is not a knight while still possibly telling the truth.  Case 3: A is a Normal Person 1. If (A) is a normal person, (A) can either tell the truth or lie. 2. If (A) tells the truth when saying \\"B is a knight,\\" then (B) is a knight.    - This cannot be true because, as we saw before, if (B) were a knight, his statement \\"A is a liar\\" would create a contradiction. 3. Hence, (A) must be lying when saying \\"B is a knight.\\" 4. This indicates that (B) is not a knight. 5. If (B) is not a knight, as before, (B) can either be a liar or a normal person.    - If (B) is a liar, the statement \\"A is a liar\\" would have to be true, contradicting the notion that (B) always lies.    - If (B) is a normal person, (B) may lie or tell the truth, and \\"A is a liar\\" being false supports the case that (A) was correct in lying and (B) told the truth in this particular instance. # Conclusion: These cases collectively prove that one of the individuals must be telling the truth or lying while not fitting the typical definitions of a knight or a liar.

If the area of each square is 1, find the total area of the overlapping black squares.","output":"Let's break the problem down step-by-step to find the total area of all the intersecting black squares when one chessboard is rotated by 45^{circ}: 1. Consider two identical 8 times 8 chessboards, each with 64 squares (32 black and 32 white) and side length 8. 2. Before rotation, the area of the entire chessboard is     [    8 times 8 = 64    ]    since each square has an area of 1. 3. When one of these chessboards is rotated by 45^{circ} about its center, the overlap region forms a perfect octagon. The length of the diagonal of the squares remains the side length multiplied by sqrt{2}. 4. To find the area of overlap (the octagon) after this 45^{circ} rotation, we calculate:    [    text{Area of overlap} = 64 (sqrt{2} - 1)    ] 5. Next, we can split this overlap area into four distinct sections based on the color of the squares:    [    text{Sections:} quad (white, white), quad (white, black), quad (black, white), quad (black, black)    ]    We denote their areas as S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, S_{4} respectively. 6. Upon rotating one board 90^{circ}, the colors swap (white becomes black and vice versa), hence:    [    S_{1} = S_{4}, quad S_{2} = S_{3}    ] 7. Further rotating by another 45^{circ} and swapping the top and bottom boards is essentially equivalent to rotating 90^{circ} only for one board, leading to:    [    S_{1} = S_{3}    ] 8. Thus, given these relationships:    [    S_{1} = S_{4}, quad S_{2} = S_{3}, quad S_{1} = S_{3}    ]    It follows that all sections have equal area:    [    S_{1} = S_{2} = S_{3} = S_{4}    ] 9. Since the total area of the overlap is 64 (sqrt{2} - 1), and it is divided equally among the four sections:    [    S_{1} + S_{2} + S_{3} + S_{4} = 64 (sqrt{2} - 1)    ]    Hence, each of the S_i is:    [    S_{1} = S_{2} = S_{3} = S_{4} = frac{64 (sqrt{2} - 1)}{4} = 16 (sqrt{2} - 1)    ] 10.

Solution: 1. **Identify the initial requirement:**      - To ensure the sum equals 1 and 2, we need at least two 1 cards.  2. **Summing up to 3:**     - We can take either one 3 card or three 1 cards. To minimize the total number of cards, it's better to take one 3 card. 3. **For sums of 4 and 5:**     - If we have already taken one 3 card and two 1 cards, it's possible to form 4 and 5 by adding one more 1 card to 3 (which makes 4), and similarly 4 + 1 makes 5. 4. **Summing up to 6:**     - We need one 5 card since it requires fewer cards than using multiple 3 and 1 cards. 5. **For sums 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10:**     - Given we already have 1, 3, and 5, adding more 1 card allows forming these sums. 6. **General rule from summing 11 to 200:**     - We recognize that after initial sums 1 through 10 are covered, each additional 9 increment (i.e., choosing a 9 card) adds sequential sums up to the required 200.      - To compute the number of 9 cards needed: (200 - 10) div 9 = 21 with a remainder, signifying one additional 9 card is necessary. 7. **Calculation:**     - Initial cards sum up to 10: We need 2 cards (1) + 1 card (3) + 1 card (5) = 4 cards.     - Additional cards to span to 200: 21 cards (9) + 1 extra card for the remaining sum = 22 cards. 8. **Sum up the total cards:**     - Initial required cards 4 + 22 9 cards = 26 cards. # Conclusion The minimum number of cards required to ensure that the sum can represent all integers from 1 to 200 is: boxed{26}"},{"instruction":"A book is 98 pages long.

The dihedral angle phi is the angle between the normals to the planes containing triangles PQR and PQS. Assume without loss of generality that PQ = PT = 1. Then, since the base QRS is a square, QR = 1. The angle angle PQT = 60^circ leads to PT = QT = 1 and they form an equilateral triangle at the base. Using the formula for the cosine of the dihedral angle between two planes (which can be derived from considering the dot product of normals to the planes), we have:  cos phi = frac{|vec{n}_{PQR} cdot vec{n}_{PQS}|}{|vec{n}_{PQR}| |vec{n}_{PQS}|}  Where vec{n}_{PQR} and vec{n}_{PQS} are the normals to planes PQR and PQS, respectively.

Let the arcs intersect at two points and label these intersections as ( C ) and ( D ).

Let the foot of this perpendicular be ( M ). This means ( PM perp OA ). 3. **Coordinate Geometry Analysis:**    - Since ( A ) is a fixed point, let’s assume ( A ) is at ((1, 0)) on the unit circle for simplicity—any other fixed point's coordinates can be converted later via rotation or other symmetries.    - Point ( P ), moving on the unit circle, can be represented by coordinates ((cos x, sin x)), where ( x ) is the angle (angle AOP). 4. **Finding the Perpendicular Foot ( M ):**    - The line ( OA ) is the x-axis since ( A = (1, 0)). Therefore, dropping a perpendicular from ( P(cos x, sin x) ) to this line lands ( M ) directly below ( P ) on the x-axis. Thus, ( M ) has coordinates ((cos x, 0)). 5. **Distance Calculation:**    - The distance from ( M ) to ( OP ) (the line through ( O ) and ( P )), is essentially the y-coordinate of ( P ), which is (sin x). 6. **Using the Perpendicular Distance Formula:**    - If we use the analytical geometry formula to find perpendicular distance from a point to a line, here ( M ) to ( OP ), we can simplify the distance based directly on unit circle properties.  7. **Conclusion using the Product-to-Sum Identities:**    - The perpendicular height of ( P ) from ( OA ) is essentially (|sin x cos x|).    - Considering periodic nature of trigonometric functions and their absolute values make ( f(x) = |sin x cos x| ).

Let OK and OL represent halves of diagonals KM and LN respectively. Then, each triangle within the kite, such as KLM and LMN, can be treated individually. Using the given radii to find area relations: The area of triangle KLM using its formula related to the circumradius R is Area = frac{OK cdot OL cdot KL}{4R}, so we can express OK cdot OL = frac{4 cdot Area}{KL}. Substituting the circumradius and simplifying yields: OK cdot OL = frac{4 cdot Area}{8} for triangle KLM and similarly, OK cdot OL = frac{4 cdot Area}{16} for triangle LMN. Noting that OK = OL by symmetry, and equating areas: frac{Area}{8} = frac{Area}{16} which simplifies to OL = 2 cdot OK. Suppose OK = x, then OL = 2x.

(a + 3d = 150^circ)  (largest angle) From equation 2, solving for (a): [ a + a + 3d = 180^circ ] [ 2a + 3d = 180^circ ] Substituting (a + 3d = 150^circ) into the equation gives: [ 2a + 150^circ = 180^circ ] [ 2a = 30^circ ] [ a = 15^circ ] Thus, the smallest angle in the kite is (boxed{15^circ})."},{"instruction":"a restaurant , glasses are stored in two different  sized boxes . one box contains 12 glasses , and the other contains 16 glasses . if the average number of glasses per box is 15 , and there are 16 more of the larger boxes , what is the total number of glasses q at the restaurant ?

According to the problem, there are 16 more larger boxes than smaller boxes, so we can write: y = x + 16 We are also given that the average number of glasses per box is 15. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of glasses by the total number of boxes. So we can write: (12x + 16y) / (x + y) = 15 Now we can substitute y from the first equation into the second equation: (12x + 16(x + 16)) / (x + (x + 16)) = 15 Simplify and solve for x: (12x + 16x + 256) / (2x + 16) = 15 28x + 256 = 15(2x + 16) 28x + 256 = 30x + 240 Subtract 28x from both sides: 256 = 2x + 240 Subtract 240 from both sides: 16 = 2x Divide by 2: x = 8 Now we know there are 8 smaller boxes. We can find the number of larger boxes by using the first equation: y = x + 16 y = 8 + 16 y = 24 Now we can calculate the total number of glasses (q) by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of glasses in each type of box and adding them together: q = (12 * 8) + (16 * 24) q = 96 + 384 q = 480 So the total number of glasses at the restaurant is boxed{480} ."},{"instruction":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(4,3) and overrightarrow{b}=(1,2).

Let’s denote the numbers of songs Alina, Tina, and Hanna sang as a, t, and h respectively. 2. **Set up the equation for total songs**:     - The total number of performances, P, is given by the sum of the songs each friend sang divided by 4 (since each song is sung by 4 friends). Thus, P = frac{8 + 5 + a + t + h}{4}. 3. **Ensure the total is an integer**:     - Since P must be an integer, 8 + 5 + a + t + h must be divisible by 4.     - Simplifying, 13 + a + t + h must be divisible by 4. 4. **Finding possible values for a + t + h**:     - Since Alina, Tina, and Hanna sang more than Mary (5) but less than Zoe (8), assume the possible numbers they sang were 6 or 7 each.     - Possible sums for a + t + h are 18, 19, 20, or 21.     - Check divisibility by 4: 13 + 18 = 31 (not divisible by 4), 13 + 19 = 32 (divisible by 4), others are not divisible.     - Use a + t + h = 19 and assume a = 7, t = 6, h = 6 for divisibility. 5. **Calculate the total number of songs**:     - Substituting back, P = frac{8 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 6}{4} = frac{32}{4} = 8. 6. **Conclusion**:     - The total number of songs sung by the quartets is 8.

Try considering the product of any two positive numbers smaller than 1.","output":"To determine if the product of two numbers can be less than one of the factors, we will consider specific scenarios involving positive numbers less than 1, and a combination of negative and positive numbers. 1. **Case 1: Both Numbers Less Than 1 (Positive)**    Let's take two positive numbers a and b, where 0 < a < 1 and 0 < b < 1.     - Product: a times b    - Since both a and b are fractions (values less than 1), the product will also be a fraction (value less than either a or b).    For example:    [    a = 0.5, quad b = 0.2    ]    The product:    [    a times b = 0.5 times 0.2 = 0.1    ]    Clearly:    [    0.1 < 0.2    ] 2. **Case 2: One Number Negative, Another Positive Greater Than 1**    Let's take two numbers a and b such that a is negative and less than 0, and b is positive and greater than 1, i.e., a < 0 and b > 1.    - Product: a times b    - Here, the product will be negative because the multiplication of a negative and a positive number is always negative, and thus it will be less than the positive number b. Additionally, if |a| < 1, the product will also be less than |a|.    For example:    [    a = -0.5, quad b = 2    ]    The product:    [    a times b = -0.5 times 2 = -1    ]    Clearly:    [    -1 < 2    ] # Conclusion Given the above explanations and examples, it is evident that the product of two numbers can indeed be less than one of the multiplicands, specifically in cases where both numbers are positive and less than 1, or one is negative and less than 0 while the other is positive and greater than 1. Thus, the product of two numbers can be less than the smaller of the two multiplicands, as shown in the following example: [ 0.5 times 0.122 < 0.122 ] [ boxed{0.5 times 0.122 < 0.122} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how many unique sixdigit numbers greater than 300,000 can be formed where the digit in the thousand's place is less than 3?","output":"To form a six-digit number greater than 300,000 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition, and with the digit in the thousand's place being less than 3, we can follow these steps: 1. **First Digit (Hundred Thousands Place):** Since the number must be greater than 300,000, the first digit can only be 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, there are 3 choices for the first digit. 2. **Fourth Digit (Thousands Place):** Given the condition that the digit in the thousand's place must be less than 3, the available digits for this position are 0, 1, and 2. However, one of these digits might have been used in the first step. Thus, there are 2 choices left for the fourth digit. 3. **Remaining Digits:** For the remaining four positions (second, third, fifth, and sixth places), the first chosen digit will leave 5 options, the second choice will leave 4 options, then 3, and finally 2 options for the last digit. Combining these choices, the total number of unique six-digit numbers that can be formed is calculated as follows: [3 times 2 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 = 720] However, this calculation includes numbers where the first digit is 3 and the fourth digit (thousands place) is 0, 1, or 2, which are not greater than 300,000. To correct for this, we subtract the numbers that start with 300,000 but are not valid due to the fourth digit's restriction: For numbers starting with 300,000, the first digit is fixed as 3, and the fourth digit (thousands place) can only be 0 or 1 (since it must be less than 2 to be considered in this subtraction), leaving 2 choices. The remaining three positions (second, third, and fifth, sixth places) can be filled in 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 ways. So, the correction is: [2 times 24 = 48] Subtracting the incorrect cases from the total, we get: [720 - 48 = 672] However, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation or interpretation of the problem as per the provided solution.

Therefore, ( p^l mid binom{n}{k} ), which implies ( p^l mid prod_{i=1}^{k}(n-i+1) ). Given that ( p > k ), it follows that there can only be one multiple of ( p ) among ( n, n-1, ldots, n-k+1 ).      3. **Finding the Multiple of ( p^l ):**     Denote this single value as ( n-i_0 ) where ( i_0 in {0, 1, ldots, k-1} ). It thus follows that      [     n geq n - i_0 geq p^l.     ]     Because ( p^l > k^l ) and ( k^l geq k^2 ), it entails that     [     n geq p^l > k^l geq k^2.     ] 4. **Representation Setup:**     Suppose ( n - i = a_i m_i^l ), where ( m_i in mathbb{N}^* ) and ( a_i ) does not contain any ( l )-th power factor. Moreover, factors of ( a_i ) cannot exceed ( k ). Therefore, ( a_i )'s factors should permit ( prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i mid k! ). 5. **Contradiction with Uniqueness.**     Let us prove that for all ( i neq j ), ( a_i neq a_j ). Assume towards a contradiction that ( exists i neq j ) such that ( a_i = a_j ). Given ( n-i > n-j ), we have:     [     m_i > m_j quad text{or} quad m_i geq m_j + 1.     ]     This yields:     [     k > j geq j - i = (n-i) - (n-j) = a_j (m_i^l - m_j^l) geq a_j ( (m_j + 1)^l - m_j^l ).     ]     By factorizing further:     [     (m_j + 1)^l - m_j^l > l m_j^{l-1} = sqrt{a_j m_j^l} geq l sqrt{n-k+1} geq l sqrt{frac{n}{2}+1} > sqrt{n}.     ]     Thus, there is a contradiction with our initial assumption. 6. **Ordering of Values (a_i):**     We need to show that ({a_0, a_1, cdots, a_{k-1}} = {1, 2, cdots, k}).

Let ( p_0 ) be a prime factor of ( v ). Then, ( p_0 ) must also be a factor of (prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i leq k).

We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the population after 2 years, since the population is increasing at a compound rate annually. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount) r = the annual interest rate (decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for In this case, we are looking for the population, so we can replace A with the population after 2 years (14,400), P with the initial population (10,000), r with the annual percentage increase (which we need to find), n with 1 (since the population increases annually), and t with 2 (since we are looking at the population after 2 years). So the formula becomes: 14,400 = 10,000(1 + r/1)^(1*2) Simplifying, we get: 14,400 = 10,000(1 + r)^2 Now we need to solve for r.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Total ways without restrictions**: First, we calculate the total number of ways to distribute the 5 books among the 4 students without any restrictions. Since each book is different and each student can receive only one book, this is simply the number of ways to assign each of the 5 books to one of the 4 students, which is a permutation of 5 items taken 4 at a time, denoted as {A}_{5}^{4}. 2. **Restriction - Books A and B cannot go to the same student**: To adhere to the restriction that Books A and B cannot be given to the same student, we subtract the scenarios where A and B are given to the same student from the total.    a. **Scenarios where A and B are given to the same student**: First, choose 2 books out of the 5 (which will be A and B) in {C}_{5}^{2} ways. Then, distribute these two books along with the other 3 to the 4 students, which can be done in {A}_{4}^{4} ways since we are assigning 4 distinct items (the pair of A and B considered as one item, plus the 3 other books) to 4 students.    b. **Total ways with A and B together**: The total number of ways where A and B are given to the same student is the product of the two numbers calculated in step 2a, which is {C}_{5}^{2}•{A}_{4}^{4}. 3. **Calculating the final answer**: To find the total number of distribution schemes where Books A and B cannot be given to the same student, we subtract the number of restricted scenarios (where A and B are together) from the total number of scenarios without restrictions.    - Total ways without restrictions: {A}_{5}^{4}    - Subtract the ways where A and B are together: {C}_{5}^{2}•{A}_{4}^{4}    - However, there's a mistake in the original solution's description of the unrestricted scenario. The correct unrestricted scenario should consider all 5 books being distributed to 4 students, which is not directly calculated as {A}_{5}^{4}.

The provided solution directly jumps to the calculation involving {C}_{5}^{2}•{A}_{4}^{4}-{A}_{4}^{4} without accurately defining the unrestricted total. Given the confusion in the original solution's description of the unrestricted scenario, let's correct the approach based on the final calculation provided: - The correct calculation for the number of ways to distribute the books, ensuring Books A and B are not given to the same student, is directly given by the formula {C}_{5}^{2}•{A}_{4}^{4}-{A}_{4}^{4}. This calculation accounts for removing the scenarios where A and B are together from the total permutations of distributing two selected books among 4 students.

Find minimum possible value of  d","output":"1. **Identify the order of points on the semicircle:**    Given the points (A), (B), (C), and (D) on the semicircle with diameter (AB = d), we need to determine the order of these points. Since ( |BC| = |CD| = a ) and ( |DA| = b ), the points must be in the order (A, D, C, B) on the semicircle. The order (A, C, D, B) would imply (B = D), which is impossible since (b neq d). 2. **Define the angles and use trigonometric identities:**    Let (2theta) be the angle subtended by the arc (BC) at the center (O) of the semicircle. Then, the length (BC) can be expressed as:    [    a = d sin theta    ]    Similarly, the length (DA) can be expressed using the angle (2theta) as:    [    b = d cos 2theta    ]    Using the double-angle identity for cosine, we have:    [    cos 2theta = 1 - 2sin^2 theta    ]    Substituting (sin theta = frac{a}{d}) into the equation, we get:    [    b = d left(1 - 2 left(frac{a}{d}right)^2right) = d - frac{2a^2}{d}    ] 3. **Formulate the equation:**    Rearranging the equation (b = d - frac{2a^2}{d}), we get:    [    bd = d^2 - 2a^2    ]    This can be rewritten as:    [    2a^2 = d(d - b)    ] 4. **Analyze the divisibility and coprimality:**    If (p) is a common divisor of (b) and (d), then (p^2) must divide (2a^2). Since (a), (b), and (d) are different positive integers, (b) and (d) must be coprime. Therefore, we consider two cases:    - (d = 2m^2) and (d - b = n^2) with (a = mn)    - (d = m^2) and (d - b = 2n^2) with (a = mn) 5. **Evaluate the first case:**    - For (d = 2m^2) and (d - b = n^2):      - If (m = 1), then (d = 2) and (b = 1), which implies (a = 1). This is impossible since (a), (b), and (d) must be different.      - If (m = 2), then (d = 8) and (d - b = 7), so (b = 1). This implies (a = 2 times 1 = 2). Thus, ((a, b, d) = (2, 1, 8)). 6. **Evaluate the second case:**    - For (d = m^2) and (d - b = 2n^2):      - If (m = 1), there is no valid (b).      - If (m = 2), then (d = 4) and (d - b = 2), so (b = 2). This implies (a = 2 times 1 = 2), which is impossible since (a = b).      - If (m = 3), then (d = 9) and (d - b = 2n^2). This gives a solution greater than the one already found. 7. **Conclusion:**    The minimum possible value of (d) is found in the first case with (m = 2), giving (d = 8).

If |FQ|=6, then the directrix equation of C is ____.","output":"To solve the problem, let's follow the steps closely related to the given solution: 1. **Assumption about P's location**: Since P is on the parabola C:y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right) and we assume it's in the first quadrant, the coordinates of P can be derived from the general point on the parabola. For a parabola with a focus at (frac{p}{2}, 0), a point P on the parabola at a distance p from the vertex along the axis of symmetry would have coordinates Pleft(frac{p}{2}, pright). 2. **Slope of OP (k_{OP})**: The slope of the line connecting the origin O to point P is calculated using the change in y over the change in x. Thus, k_{OP} = frac{p - 0}{frac{p}{2} - 0} = frac{p}{frac{p}{2}} = 2. 3. **Slope of PQ (k_{PQ})**: Since PQ is perpendicular to OP, the slope of PQ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OP. Therefore, k_{PQ} = -frac{1}{k_{OP}} = -frac{1}{2}. 4. **Equation of PQ**: Using the point-slope form of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line, the equation of PQ is y - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). 5. **Finding x when y=0**: Setting y=0 in the equation of PQ to find the x-intercept, we get 0 - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). Solving for x gives x = frac{5p}{2}. 6. **Given |FQ|=6**: The distance |FQ| is the difference in the x-coordinates of F and Q. Since F is at (frac{p}{2}, 0) and Q is at (frac{5p}{2}, 0), we have |FQ| = left|frac{5p}{2} - frac{p}{2}right| = 6. Solving this equation for p gives p = 3. 7. **Directrix of the parabola**: The directrix of a parabola y^{2}=2px is a vertical line x = -frac{p}{2}. Substituting p = 3 into this formula gives the directrix equation as x = -frac{3}{2}.

If a fast horse delivers the document, it takes 2 days less than the specified time x, so the time taken by the fast horse is x - 2 days. 3. The speed of the fast horse is frac{5}{2} times the speed of the slow horse. Since speed is inversely proportional to time when distance is constant, we can set up the equation based on the speeds of the horses and the times taken by them to cover the same distance of 800 miles. Let's denote the speed of the slow horse as S and the speed of the fast horse as frac{5}{2}S. The equations based on the given conditions are: - For the slow horse: Distance = Speed times Time Rightarrow 800 = S times (x + 1) - For the fast horse: Distance = Speed times Time Rightarrow 800 = frac{5}{2}S times (x - 2) To find the equation that represents the specified time x, we need to equate the distances covered by both horses, as they are the same but with different speeds and times. This gives us the equation: [ frac{800}{x + 1} = frac{5}{2} times frac{800}{x - 2} ] This equation correctly represents the relationship between the speeds of the two horses, the distance covered, and the specified time x.

To find the 24th multiple, we can simply add 4 to 16 twenty-three more times (since 16 is the first, we need 23 more to reach the 24th). Alternatively, we can calculate it by multiplying 24 by 4 and then adding the result to 12.

One way this can be achieved is by cutting along the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse. 3. Specifically, the triangle ABC can be divided along the line DE, where D and E are the midpoints of the hypotenuse and the legs respectively (if D and E are midpoints, cutting along the median to the hypotenuse will form two right triangles that can make a rectangle). This is shown in figure 14 and figure 16 where E and M are the midpoints of sides AB and AC respectively. Thus, the triangle could have been a right triangle.  # Case 2: Isosceles Triangle 1.

Speed of the first train in m/s = 72 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 20 m/s Speed of the second train in m/s = 36 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 10 m/s Since the trains are moving in the same direction, we need to find the relative speed between them. Relative speed = Speed of the first train - Speed of the second train Relative speed = 20 m/s - 10 m/s = 10 m/s The total length that needs to be crossed when one train passes the other is the sum of the lengths of both trains. Total length = Length of the first train + Length of the second train Total length = 380 m + 540 m = 920 m Now, we can find the time it takes for the first train to cross the second train using the formula: Time = Total length / Relative speed Time = 920 m / 10 m/s = 92 seconds So, it will take boxed{92}  seconds for the first train to completely pass the second train."},{"instruction":"Following an increase in prices, the price of a candy box is now 20 pounds and the price of a can of soda is 6 pounds.

The area of this triangle can be calculated as frac{1}{2} cdot 2b cdot c = sqrt{3}, where 2b is the length of the minor axis. - The relationship between a, b, and c for an ellipse is given by a^2 = b^2 + c^2.

Substituting x = -frac{1}{3} into f(2+x) = f(x), we get f(2-frac{1}{3}) = f(-frac{1}{3}). Since 2-frac{1}{3} = frac{6}{3} - frac{1}{3} = frac{5}{3}, we have f(frac{5}{3}) = f(-frac{1}{3}) = frac{1}{3}.

We are also given the equation P = Q + R + 32. From the information given, we can write the following equations: B = 1/3 * P C = 1/3 * P Since B and C are both 1/3 of P, we can combine them: B + C = 1/3 * P + 1/3 * P B + C = 2/3 * P Now, let's look at the equation for y: y = B + C + P + z We can substitute B + C with 2/3 * P: y = 2/3 * P + P + z Now, let's look at the equation for z: z = Q - R We know that P = Q + R + 32, so we can substitute Q with P - R - 32: z = (P - R - 32) - R z = P - 2R - 32 Now, let's substitute z back into the equation for y: y = 2/3 * P + P + (P - 2R - 32) Since y is also the additional amount that q and r would have had, we can write: Q + R + y = B + C + P Substituting y, we get: Q + R + (2/3 * P + P + (P - 2R - 32)) = B + C + P Now, let's substitute B + C with 2/3 * P: Q + R + (2/3 * P + P + (P - 2R - 32)) = 2/3 * P + P Simplifying, we get: Q + R + (5/3 * P - 2R - 32) = 5/3 * P Now, let's solve for P: Q + R + 5/3 * P - 2R - 32 = 5/3 * P Q - R - 32 = 0 Since we know that z = Q - R, we can substitute z for Q - R: z - 32 = 0 Now, we know that z = 32.

Given that triangle A O B is equilateral, the distances OA and OB must be equal. Using the distance formula:          OA = OB          The lengths are:          OA = sqrt{a^{2} + left(frac{1}{a}right)^{2}} = sqrt{a^{2} + frac{1}{a^{2}}}               OB = sqrt{b^{2} + left(frac{1}{b}right)^{2}} = sqrt{b^{2} + frac{1}{b^{2}}}          Setting these equal, we get:          sqrt{a^{2} + frac{1}{a^{2}}} = sqrt{b^{2} + frac{1}{b^{2}}}          Squaring both sides, we obtain:          a^2 + frac{1}{a^2} = b^2 + frac{1}{b^2}          Since we are given that A and B form an equilateral triangle with O, b must be of the form frac{1}{a} to preserve symmetry around the y = frac{1}{x} curve.

Specifically, there must be 4 pairs ((i, j)) such that ( d_i + d_j = 2d_k ). This is because each pair contributes 2 to the coefficient, and we need a total of 8 additional contributions (since 1 + 8 = 9). 5. **Implications of the pairs ((i, j)):**    For each pair ((i, j)) with ( d_i + d_j = 2d_k ):    - One of ( d_i ) and ( d_j ) must be greater than ( d_k ).    - One of ( d_i ) and ( d_j ) must be less than ( d_k ).    Therefore, for each ( d_k ) with a coefficient of 9, there must be at least 4 exponents ( d_i ) greater than ( d_k ) and at least 4 exponents ( d_j ) less than ( d_k ). 6. **Range of ( k ):**    Since there are 20 distinct ( d_k ), the position ( k ) of ( d_k ) must satisfy:    [    5 leq k leq 16    ]    This is because there must be at least 4 exponents less than ( d_k ) and at least 4 exponents greater than ( d_k ). 7. **Maximum number of coefficients equal to 9:**    The range ( 5 leq k leq 16 ) includes 12 possible values for ( k ). Therefore, there can be at most 12 coefficients of ( f(x)^2 ) that are equal to 9. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since there can be at most 12 coefficients of ( f(x)^2 ) that are equal to 9, it is not possible for thirteen coefficients of ( f(x)^2 ) to equal 9.

Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Define the Points and Conditions:**    - Let ( B = (x_1, x_2, x_3) ) and ( D = (y_1, y_2, y_3) ).    - The side length of the square ( AB = AD = t ) must be an integer.    - This implies ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 = t^2 ). 2. **Perpendicularity Condition:**    - For ( ABCD ) to be a square, ( BA ) and ( DA ) must be perpendicular.    - This translates to the dot product condition: ( x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 = 0 ). 3. **Primitive Lattice Points:**    - Both ( B ) and ( D ) must be primitive lattice points, meaning ( gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 1 ) and ( gcd(y_1, y_2, y_3) = 1 ). 4. **Unbalanced Condition:**    - The weights of ( B ) and ( D ) must be different: ( |x_1| + |x_2| + |x_3| neq |y_1| + |y_2| + |y_3| ). 5. **Distinct Planes:**    - The planes containing the squares must not be parallel, which means the normal vectors to these planes must not be scalar multiples of each other. 6. **Constructing the Points:**    - Let ( x_1 = y_1 = a ).    - We need to find ( x_2, x_3, y_2, y_3 ) such that the conditions are satisfied. 7. **Simplifying the Conditions:**    - The perpendicularity condition becomes ( a^2 = x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 ).    - We also need ( x_2^2 + x_3^2 = y_2^2 + y_3^2 ). 8. **Parameterization:**    - Let ( x_2 - y_2 = 2tu ), ( x_2 + y_2 = 2vw ), ( y_3 - x_3 = 2tv ), ( y_3 + x_3 = 2uw ).    - This gives ( x_2 = tu + vw ), ( y_2 = vw - tu ), ( x_3 = uw - tv ), ( y_3 = tv + uw ). 9. **Solving for ( a ):**    - We need ( a^2 = (tu + vw)(vw - tu) + (tv + uw)(uw - tv) = (w^2 - t^2)(u^2 + v^2) ).    - We also need ( t^2 = a^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = (w^2 - t^2)(u^2 + v^2) + (tu + vw)^2 + (uw - tv)^2 = (w^2 - t^2)(u^2 + v^2) + (t^2 + w^2)(u^2 + v^2) = 2w^2(u^2 + v^2) ). 10. **Finding ( u ) and ( v ):**     - Let ( u^2 + v^2 = 2l^2 ), so ( t = 2wl ).     - We need ( w^2 - t^2 = 2k^2 ), and ( a = 2kl ). 11. **Final Parameterization:**     - Let ( w - t = 2f^2 ), ( w + t = 4g^2 ), so ( w = f^2 + 2g^2 ) and ( t = 2g^2 - f^2 ).     - For ( u^2 + v^2 = 2l^2 ), let ( v - l = 2cd ), ( v + l = 2ef ), ( l - u = 2ce ), ( l + u = 2df ), so ( l = ef - cd = ce + df ). 12. **Constructing the Points:**     - ( x_1 = y_1 = 4fg(d^2 + e^2) ).     - ( x_2 = (2g^2 - f^2)(e^2 + 2ed - d^2) + (d^2 + 2ed - e^2)(f^2 + 2g^2) ).     - ( x_3 = (f^2 + 2g^2)(e^2 + 2ed - d^2) - (d^2 + 2ed - e^2)(2g^2 - f^2) ).     - ( y_2 = (f^2 + 2g^2)(d^2 + 2ed - e^2) - (e^2 + 2ed - d^2)(2g^2 - f^2) ).     - ( y_3 = (2g^2 - f^2)(d^2 + 2ed - e^2) + (e^2 + 2ed - d^2)(f^2 + 2g^2) ). 13. **Verification:**     - Check that the constructed points satisfy all the conditions, including being primitive lattice points and having different weights. 14. **Conclusion:**     - By varying the parameters ( f, g, e, d ), we can generate infinitely many such points, ensuring that the planes are not parallel.

If he sells 15 pencils for 1 rupee, the selling price (SP) for each pencil is: SP = 1 rupee / 15 pencils To find the cost price (CP) of each pencil, we need to consider the loss percentage. If he incurs a 15% loss, it means he sells each pencil at 85% of the cost price (100% - 15% loss = 85% of CP). So, we have: SP = 85% of CP Let's denote the cost price of each pencil as CP.

Step 1: Consider student A and student B as a single entity since they must stand next to each other. There are two ways to arrange A and B within this entity because either A can stand next to B or B can stand next to A. This gives us A_2^2 = 2 ways to arrange them internally. Step 2: Now, excluding students A, B, and C, we are left with three students. These three students can be arranged in any order among themselves. This means we have A_3^3 = 3! = 6 ways to arrange these three students. Step 3: We then need to find the correct spots to insert student C, ensuring C is not next to A or B. Given we've grouped A and B together and have three other students placed, this effectively gives us five distinct positions (before the AB entity, between the three other students, and after the AB entity) to insert C. However, since C cannot be next to A or B, we exclude the positions directly next to the AB entity, leaving us with three valid positions for C. Therefore, there are A_4^2 = 4! / (4-2)! = 12 ways to arrange these positions, specifically considering the positions available for C and the other students around AB.

This means each lock is accessible by exactly three directors. This satisfies the condition that any three directors can open all 10 locks, but any two directors cannot open all 10 locks.    Hence, ( n = 6 ) is the minimum number of keys each director should have. The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 6 } )."},{"instruction":"On each of the six faces of a cube, a number is written. Then, on each of the twelve edges, the sum of the numbers on the two adjacent faces is written. Is it possible to uniquely reconstruct the numbers on the faces given these 12 sums on the edges?","output":"1. **Define Variables:**    Let the numbers written on the faces of the cube be a, b, c, d, e, and f. 2. **Sum of Numbers on Edges:**    Each edge of the cube has a number which is the sum of the numbers on the two faces that the edge joins. Thus, there are 12 such edges given by:    [    a + b, , a + c, , a + d, , a + e, , b + c, , b + f, , c + f, , d + f, , d + e, , e + f, , b + d, , c + e    ] 3. **Calculating a set of Summations:**    Focus on one face, say a. The edges connected to face a are: a+b, a+c, a+d, and a+e. Now, let's total the four edges around a:    [    (a + b) + (a + c) + (a + d) + (a + e)    ]    This gives:    [    4a + b + c + d + e    ]     4. **Subtracting Opposite Edge Sums:**    Each face is adjacent to 4 edges and opposite edges. You also know the sums of two edges that don’t share a face with a but meet at vertices joining a e.g. (b + d) and (c + e). Now consider the following calculations:    [    4a + b + c + d + e - (b + d) - (c + e)    ]    This simplifies to:    [    4a    ] 5. **Solving for a:**    Divide the equation by 4 to isolate a:    [    a = frac{4a}{4} = a    ] 6. **Generalization:**    By similar logic, you can isolate b, c, d, e, and f in the same manner. Therefore, while knowing the sums on the edges, one can effectively deduce the numbers on each face by repeatedly using the summation and subtraction. **Conclusion:**    [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"instruction":"The point with coordinates (10, 14) is the midpoint of the segment with one endpoint at (12, 6).

If box (1) and box (k) have not been partnered in a question, this contradicts our comprehensive questioning pattern, unless we realize a fundamental counting error.      7. **Conclusion by Pigeonhole Principle**:     - By the pigeonhole principle, given that we have (2004) boxes and have asked pairs till (4005) questions, we will have covered combinations ensuring the identification. 8. **Proof of Necessity**:     - **Assumption Reduction**:         - Let's assume fewer questions, such as asking only (4004) times.         - There will exist at least one unasked pair among the (2004) boxes.     - **Contradiction**:         - If we assume a hypothetical set with fewer questions, a legitimate pair verification will lead to contradiction given the structured questioning ensures all encompassing pair checks.

Therefore, only two cases are possible:      - Case 1: Three points lie on one side of the considered plane, and the fourth point lies on the other side.     - Case 2: Two points lie on each side of the plane. 2. Let's consider the first case. Assume points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) lie on one side of plane ( II ), equidistant from points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ), while point ( D ) lies on the other side.         - Since the plane ( II ) is equidistant from points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) which are on the same side, this plane must be parallel to the plane formed by points ( A, B, ) and ( C ).     - To ensure the distance from point ( D ) to this plane ( II ) equals the distance from plane ( II ) to points ( A, B, ) and ( C ), the plane ( II ) must pass through the midpoint of the perpendicular from ( D ) to the plane ( A, B, C ). 3. Similarly, a plane equidistant from these four points can be found where only one of the points is lying on one side of the plane, and the other three points lie on the other side.

Analogously, it must also be parallel to the line ( CD ).    - Given that points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) do not lie in the same plane, lines ( AB ) and ( CD ) must be skew.    - Then, plane ( II ) must pass equidistantly between two parallel planes containing lines ( AB ) and ( CD ).  5. Consequently, similar to the first set of configurations, there will be three such planes in which two points lie on one side, and the other two points lie on the other side. 6.

Now we have two equations: 1. f(x) + g(x) = e^x 2. f(x) - g(x) = e^{-x} By adding these two equations, we get: 2f(x) = e^x + e^{-x} implies f(x) = frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}.

The solution is detailed as follows:  I. Solution 1. **Identifying the Points:**    - Let (D) be the midpoint of side (AB).    - Let (E) be the point on side (BC) such that (BE = frac{1}{4}BC).    - Let (F) be the point on side (CA) such that (CF = frac{1}{8}CA). 2. **Parallel Construction:**    - Draw a line through (F) parallel to (BC).    - Let this line intersect segment (DE) at (J), and line (AB) at (K). 3. **Using the Properties of Ratios and Parallel Lines:**    - Since (FK parallel BC), by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' Theorem), we get:      [ AK : KB = AF : FC = 7:1 ]      This means (K) divides (AB) in the ratio (7:1).    - Given that (D) is the midpoint of (AB), (AD = DB = frac{1}{2}AB). Hence, the ratio (DK : KB) should be studied.      [ AK = frac{7}{8} AB quad text{and} quad KB = frac{1}{8} AB ]      Thus, (DK : KB = 3:1). 4. **Extending Parallel Lines:**    - Applying similar concepts to other sides:      - The parallel line through (F) and side (BC) results in dividing (DE) into the ratio (3:1).      - Similarly, a line through (D) parallel to (AC) divides (EF) into the ratio (1:2).      - A line through (E) parallel to (AB) results in a (5:2) ratio division on line segment (FD). 5. **Constructing the Triangle:**    - First, locate the point (J) on segment (DE) such that (DJ : JE = 3:1).    - Locate the point (L) on segment (EF) such that (EL : LF = 1:2).    - Locate the point (M) on segment (FD) such that (FM : MD = 5:2).    - Draw lines parallel to these segments:      - (FJ) through (E)      - (DL) through (F)      - (EM) through (D)    - The intersection of these parallel lines will give the sides of the desired triangle (ABC). 6. **Verification:**    - By repeated applications of the Basic Proportionality Theorem, it can be verified that in the constructed triangle (D), (E), and (F) indeed satisfy the given conditions of being the midpoint, ( frac{1}{4})th distance, and (frac{1}{8})th distance from respective vertices. If the points (D), (E), and (F) lie on a straight line, the problem would not have a solution as such dispositions would imply the sides of the triangle mingle with themselves, i.e., collinear. Hence, the constructed triangle (ABC) meets the required specifications provided the points (D), (E), and (F) are not collinear.  II. General Solution We generalize the problem with ratios (alpha, beta, gamma): 1. **Equations for Ratios:**    - Given:      [ AD : DB = 1 : alpha ]      [ BE : EC = 1 : beta ]      [ CF : FA = 1 : gamma ]    - Vector equations:      [      begin{aligned}      & mathbf{d} = frac{alpha mathbf{a} + mathbf{b}}{1 + alpha}       & mathbf{e} = frac{beta mathbf{b} + mathbf{c}}{1 + beta}       & mathbf{f} = frac{gamma mathbf{c} + mathbf{a}}{1 + gamma}       end{aligned}      ] 2. **Solving the Equations:**    - Solve for vectors (mathbf{a}), (mathbf{b}), (mathbf{c}):      [      begin{aligned}      & mathbf{a} = frac{1}{1 + alpha beta gamma} left( beta gamma (1+alpha) mathbf{d} - gamma (1+beta) mathbf{e} + (1+gamma) mathbf{f} right)       & mathbf{b} = frac{1}{1 + alpha beta gamma} left( (1+alpha) mathbf{d} + alpha gamma (1+beta) mathbf{e} - alpha (1+gamma) mathbf{f} right)       & mathbf{c} = frac{1}{1 + alpha beta gamma} left( -beta (1+alpha) mathbf{d} + (1+beta) mathbf{e} + alpha beta (1+gamma) mathbf{f} right)       end{aligned}      ] 3. **Constructing the Triangle:**    - With known vectors (mathbf{d}), (mathbf{e}), (mathbf{f}), determine vectors (mathbf{a}), (mathbf{b}), (mathbf{c}) and draw the triangle accordingly.    - Special case: for the problem (alpha=1, beta=3, gamma=7). 4. **Discussion:**    - The triangle exists uniquely if (mathbf{d}), (mathbf{e}), and (mathbf{f}) are not collinear and (alpha beta gamma neq -1).    - If they are collinear and (alpha beta gamma = -1), there are infinitely many solutions, otherwise no solution.

Because r is a non-zero natural number: [ r > 0 ] Since we assume r is a non-zero integer, let's focus on some of the implications: 4. The fact that each number gives a remainder r implies that:     - Each a_i > r to satisfy ( a_i = k_i cdot a_{i+1} + r ) (because k_i geq 1). 5.

Therefore, frac{52pi}{3} = 17pi + frac{pi}{3} since frac{52pi}{3} = (16pi + pi) + frac{pi}{3} = 17pi + frac{pi}{3}. 3. The sine function's periodicity allows us to only focus on the frac{pi}{3} part, as adding 17pi, which is 8.5 times the period of sine, doesn't change its value. Thus, sinfrac{52pi}{3} = sin(17pi + frac{pi}{3}). 4. Since sin(theta) = -sin(theta) when theta is an odd multiple of pi, we have sin(17pi + frac{pi}{3}) = -sinfrac{pi}{3}. 5.

D: The value of y decreases as the value of x increases.","output":"To analyze the correctness of each statement about the graph of the linear function y=-2x+2, let's examine each option step by step: - **Statement A**: For the function y=-2x+2, we note that the slope k=-2 is negative, and the y-intercept b=2 is positive. This means that the graph will start in the second quadrant (because of the positive y-intercept), slope downwards (because of the negative slope), and pass through the fourth quadrant as x becomes positive. It will also pass through the first quadrant as x becomes negative and y remains positive for a range of x values. Therefore, the graph indeed passes through the first, second, and fourth quadrants, making statement A correct. - **Statement B**: To find the intersection of the graph with the x-axis, we set y=0 and solve for x:   [   0 = -2x + 2 implies -2x = -2 implies x = 1   ]   Thus, the coordinates of the intersection of the graph with the x-axis are left(1,0right), not left(2,0right) as stated. Therefore, statement B is incorrect. - **Statement C**: When x > 0, we substitute any positive value for x into the equation y=-2x+2 to see that y will indeed be less than 2. This is because the slope -2 ensures that y decreases as x increases, starting from y=2 when x=0. Thus, statement C is correct. - **Statement D**: Given the slope k=-2, it is clear that as x increases, y decreases because the slope is negative. This means that the value of y decreases as the value of x increases, making statement D correct.

To find a_2, we use another property of geometric sequences: the common ratio, denoted by r, is the ratio between any term and its preceding term. Mathematically, r = frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}. 4. Calculate the common ratio r = frac{a_3}{a_1} = frac{12}{3} = 4. 5. Now, we can find a_2 = a_1 cdot r = 3 cdot 4 = 12. 6. With a_2 and a_3 known, we can now use the first property mentioned: a_2 cdot a_5 = a_3^2 to find a_5. 7. Substitute the values into the equation: 12 cdot a_5 = 12^2. 8. Solve for a_5: a_5 = frac{12^2}{12} = 48. 9.

Complete the square of the expression inside the parentheses. The number needed to complete the square is given by left(frac{4}{2}right)^2 = 4.

Establish a polar coordinate system with the coordinate origin as the pole and the positive semiaxis of x as the polar axis.

Calculate the area of triangle OBM.","output":"(I) The polar coordinate equation for line C_1: x + y = 1 + sqrt{3} is ρcos θ + ρsin θ = 1 + sqrt{3}. The parametric equations for circle C_2 are x = 2cosalpha, y = 2sinalpha, with its standard equation as x^2 + y^2 = 4, and the polar coordinate equation as ρ = 2. (II) Solving the polar coordinate equations for line C_1 and circle C_2 simultaneously, we get cos θ + sin θ = frac{1 + sqrt{3}}{2}. Given that 0 < θ < frac{π}{2}, we have θ = frac{π}{6} or frac{π}{3}. Thus, angle AOB = frac{π}{6}. Since A is the midpoint of OM, |OM| = 4. Therefore, the area of triangle OBM is frac{1}{2}|OM||OB|sinfrac{π}{6} = boxed{2}."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function L(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(i(!0),a(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",W,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
