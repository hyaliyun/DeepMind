Let (X) and (Y) be the midpoints of (AB) and (CD) respectively. We need to prove that (MN parallel AB), where (PX) intersects (BC) at (N) and (PY) intersects (AD) at (M). 2. **Projective Geometry Approach**: Consider the point at infinity (infty) on the line (ell_{AB}). We will use the cross-ratio and projective transformations to show the required parallelism. 3. **Cross-Ratio Invariance**: The cross-ratio ((A, B; X, infty)) is (-1) because (X) is the midpoint of (AB). Similarly, the cross-ratio ((D, C; Y, infty)) is (-1) because (Y) is the midpoint of (CD). 4. **Projective Transformation**: We apply a projective transformation centered at (P). Under this transformation, the cross-ratio is preserved. Therefore, we have:    [    (A, B; X, infty) overset{P}{=} (B, C; N, H)    ]    and    [    (D, C; Y, infty) overset{P}{=} (D, A; M, G)    ]    where (H) and (G) are the points where the line through (P) and (infty) intersects (BC) and (AD) respectively. 5. **Intersection at Infinity**: Since (AB parallel CD), the line through (P) and (infty) intersects (AB) and (CD) at the same point at infinity. This implies that (GH) is a line through the point at infinity, making (GH parallel AB). 6. **Conclusion**: Since the cross-ratio is preserved and (GH) is parallel to (AB), the line (MN) must also be parallel to (AB). This is because (MN) is the line connecting the intersections of (PX) and (PY) with (BC) and (AD) respectively, and these intersections are determined by the same projective transformation that preserves the parallelism.

We need to prove that it is possible to remove some of these runners such that the remaining ones do not overlap and cover at least half of the corridor. 2. **Reformulating the Problem**:    The problem can be reformulated as: \\"We need to demonstrate that we can remove some runners such that the remaining runners cover the corridor in a single layer, and their total length is at least half of the total length of the corridor.\\" 3. **Labeling the Runners**:    Number the runners from left to right in order of their left ends.  4. **Non-intersecting Runners**:    Observe that by this numbering, no two runners with the same parity (odd or even index) will intersect.  5. **Segmentation into Two Groups**:    Group the runners into two sets: those with odd indices and those with even indices. Since there is no overlap within these sets, the total coverage in each set will be the sum of the individual runner lengths within that set. 6. **Finding Maximum Coverage**:    If we denote the total length of the corridor as ( L ), then the following two observations can be made:    - The sum ( S_{text{odd}} ) of the lengths of all runners with odd indices.    - The sum ( S_{text{even}} ) of the lengths of all runners with even indices.    It must be true that ( L leq S_{text{odd}} + S_{text{even}} ). 7. **Ensuring Minimum Coverage**:    To ensure that the remaining runners cover at least half the corridor, we can find the set (either all odd-indexed runners or all even-indexed runners) which has the greater sum. Thus, we remove the opposite set. 8. **Conclusion**:    Given that the total coverage ( S_{text{odd}} + S_{text{even}} ) equals ( L ), at least one of these sums is at least ( frac{L}{2} ).

In this way, the points P and Q are inverses of each other with respect to k.

We need to determine the radius of the largest circle that can be inscribed in the resulting shape. 1. Label the center of the quarter circle as O_1 and the center of the semicircle as O_2. Let the radius of the largest inscribed circle be r, and denote its center as O_3. 2. The circle is inscribed in such a way that it touches all three boundary arcs: the quarter-circle and the two radii. 3. Since the inscribed circle touches all three boundaries, O_3 must be at an equal distance r from each boundary.  4. Analyze the geometric relationships and constraints:     - The distance from O_3 to the radius (straight line) of the quarter circle is 12 - r, as O_1O_3 = 12 - r.     - The distance from O_3 to the straight boundary (radius of the semicircle) is 6 + r, i.e., O_2 O_3 = 6 + r.     - The tangential distances on the straight boundaries add the necessary orthogonal relationship: O_1 T = r and O_2 T = 6 - r. 5.

If the trainee finds his or her own name by opening fewer than 22 drawers, they move to another room to wait for their friends. Otherwise, François kills everyone. Find a strategy that gives the trainees at least a 30 % chance of survival.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find a strategy for the mathematicians that gives them at least a 30% chance of survival. Here is a detailed solution: 1. **Numbering Stagiaires and Drawers**:     We start by numbering both the stagiaires and the drawers from 1 to 44. Hence, the situation can be understood in terms of permutations of the numbers 1 to 44. 2. **Permutation Representation**:     Let's denote by ( p(i) ) the name (or index) in drawer ( i ). This means that ( p ) represents a permutation of the numbers 1 to 44.  3. **Stagiaire Strategy**:     Each stagiaire ( i ) follows a specific strategy:     - **Step 1**: Open drawer ( i ).     - **Step 2**: If ( p(i) ) is not equal to ( i ), open drawer ( p(i) ).     - **Step 3**: If ( p(p(i)) ) is not equal to ( i ), open drawer ( p(p(i)) ).     - **Step 4**: Continue this process iteratively, where the ( k )-th drawer opened is ( p^{(k)}(i-1) ). 4. **Cycle Length Condition**:     The crucial condition for all the stagiaires to survive is that the permutation ( p ) should not have any cycle longer than 22. This is because if there is a cycle longer than 22, at least one stagiaire will need to open more than 22 drawers to find his name, which leads to failure. 5. **Probabilities and Permutations**:     We need to evaluate the probability that a random permutation of 44 elements has all cycles of length 22 or less.     a. **Counting Permutations with a Long Cycle**:         The number of permutations that have a cycle of length ( k ) (where ( k leq 44 ) and ( k geq 22 )) can be counted by choosing ( k ) elements out of 44 (which can be done in ( binom{44}{k} ) ways), then permuting the remaining 44 - ( k ) elements (which can be done in ( (44-k)! ) ways), and lastly choosing a specific cycle out of the ( k ) elements (which can be done in ( (k-1)! ) ways).         Hence, the number of such permutations is:         [         binom{44}{k}(44-k)!(k-1)!         ] 6. **Summing Over All Valid ( k )**:     The total probability of a permutation having a cycle of length above 22 is given by:     [     frac{1}{44!} sum_{k=22}^{44} binom{44}{k} (44-k)! (k-1)!     ] 7. **Simplifying the Probability Expression**:     By simplification, this quantity becomes:     [     sum_{k=22}^{44} frac{1}{k}     ]     Numerical evaluation shows that      [     sum_{k=22}^{44} frac{1}{k} < 0.68     ] 8. **Survival Probability**:     Hence, the probability that no cycle exceeds the length of 22 is at least:     [     1 - 0.68 = 0.32     ] In conclusion, the stagiaires have at least a 32% chance of survival by following the described strategy.

For selecting 1 girl out of 10, the number of ways is C(10, 1). For selecting 2 boys out of 13, the number of ways is C(13, 2). The total number of ways to select 1 girl and 2 boys is the product of these two combinations: C(10, 1) * C(13, 2) = 780 Let's calculate C(10, 1) and C(13, 2): C(10, 1) = 10! / (1! * (10 - 1)!) = 10 / 1 = 10 C(13, 2) = 13! / (2! * (13 - 2)!) = 13! / (2! * 11!) = (13 * 12) / (2 * 1) = 78 Now, we multiply these two results to find the total number of ways: 10 * 78 = 780 Since we have already found that the number of ways to select 1 girl and 2 boys is 780, and our calculation matches this, we can confirm that the number of students selected at random is 1 girl + 2 boys = boxed{3}  students."},{"instruction":"the given figure, arc ADB and arc BEC are semicircles, each with a radius of two units.

The smallest such sum within the range 9 to 18 is 12. 4. To ensure this sum is as low as possible, configure the numbers to reach that sum.

Since lambda overrightarrow {a}+ overrightarrow {b} is collinear with overrightarrow {c}=(-4,-7), we can assert that there exists a non-zero scalar k such that: k(lambda overrightarrow {a}+ overrightarrow {b}) = overrightarrow {c}, which translates into the equation: k(lambda + 2, 2lambda + 3) = (-4, -7).

Using the relation xy = uv, we substitute to get:    [    x + y + 2sqrt{uv}.    ] 6. Since u + v = 2sqrt{uv} (this follows from the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, which states that u + v geq 2sqrt{uv} with equality if and only if u = v), we have:    [    u + v = 2sqrt{uv}.    ] 7. Therefore, the total area S can be written as:    [    S = x + y + u + v = x + y + 2sqrt{uv}.    ] 8. Hence, we have shown that:    [    S = left( sqrt{x} + sqrt{y} right)^2.    ] 9.

We need to show that either one of the curves (K_1) or (K_2) contains a parallel straight-line segment to (AB) of length (a), or both curves contain parallel straight-line segments whose lengths sum to (a). 2. **Referencing a Prior Problem (Problem 41)**:     From Problem 41, the definition of the sum of convex curves (K_1) and (K_2) states that any point on (K), the sum of (K_1) and (K_2), can be represented as the sum of points from (K_1) and (K_2):    [    forall P in K, exists P_1 in K_1 text{ and } P_2 in K_2 text{ such that } P = P_1 + P_2    ] 3. **Considering the Geometry of (K)**:    Since (K_1 + K_2) contains the straight-line segment (AB), this line segment represents all possible sums of points (A_1 + A_2), where (A_1) are points on (K_1) and (A_2) are points on (K_2), as stated in the problem. 4. **Argument for Parallel Line Segments**:    Let's assume we have the straight-line segment (AB) within (K) that is of length (a). This segment can be represented parametrically as follows:    [    A + t(B - A) = (A_1 + A_2) + t[(B_1 + B_2) - (A_1 + A_2)] = (A_1 + t(B_1 - A_1)) + (A_2 + t(B_2 - A_2))    ]    So, each point on the line segment (AB) can be decomposed into sums of corresponding points on line segments (A_1B_1) from (K_1) and (A_2B_2) from (K_2). 5. **Conclusion Derived from the Above Argument**:    - If the length of (A_1B_1) or (A_2B_2) is equal to (a), then either (K_1) or (K_2) fully contains a parallel line segment of length (a).    - If neither (A_1B_1) nor (A_2B_2) individually has the length (a), their lengths must then sum to (a) by the property of the sum curve (K). Thus, both (K_1) and (K_2) contain parallel line segments whose lengths add up to (a).

The initial output per hour was ( frac{O}{H} ). The new output per hour is ( frac{1.20O}{0.70H} ).

The numerical value of the number can be expressed as:    [    N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d    ]    The reverse of this number would be ( overline{dcba} ), which can be expressed as:    [    R = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a    ] 2. **Formulate the Summation Condition:**    According to the problem statement, the sum of ( N ) and ( R ) should be divisible by 101:    [    N + R = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) + (1000d + 100c + 10b + a)    ] 3. **Simplify the Expression:**    Simplify the sum:    [    N + R = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1000d + 100c + 10b + a    ]    Combine like terms:    [    N + R = 1001a + 20b + 110c + 1001d    ] 4. **Factorize and Check Divisibility:**    Observe the common factors in the expression:    [    N + R = 1001(a + d) + 110c + 20b    ] 5. **Apply the Modulo 101 Condition:**    For ( N + R ) to be divisible by 101, we need:    [    1001(a + d) + 110c + 20b equiv 0 pmod{101}    ]    Since ( 1001 equiv -10 pmod{101} ), rewrite the equation:    [    -10(a + d) + 110c + 20b equiv 0 pmod{101}    ]    Simplify the coefficients modulo 101:    [    -10(a + d) + 9c + 20b equiv 0 pmod{101}    ] 6. **Look for a Concrete Example:**    We need to find digits ( a, b, c, d ) such that the above congruence holds.

This implies g(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0,1). **Step 5:** Since g(x) is monotonically decreasing and g(0) = 0, we have g(x) < 0 for x in (0,1), i.e., x-x^{2} < sin x. **Step 6:** Define h(x) = x - sin x for x in (0,1). **Step 7:** Calculate the first derivative of h(x): h'(x) = 1 - cos x > 0, indicating that h(x) is monotonically increasing in (0,1). **Step 8:** Since h(x) is monotonically increasing and h(0) = 0, we have h(x) > 0 for x in (0,1), i.e., sin x < x. **Conclusion for Part 1:** Combining the results, we conclude that for 0 < x < 1, we have x-x^{2} < sin x < x.

At the end of the tournament, it was found that there were 9 participants who scored no more than 4 points each. It is known that Petya scored exactly 9 points. How did he play against each of the remaining two chess players? (A win is 1 point, a draw is 0.5 points, and a loss is 0 points.) 1. Consider the nine participants mentioned in the problem who each scored no more than 4 points. 2. Among these 9 participants, each participated in  binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36  games in total.        - **Explanation:** Every pair among the 9 participants played exactly one game against each other. The number of such games is given by the combination formula binom{n}{2} for n=9 participants.  3. Each game has a total of 1 point to be distributed (either as 1 point to one participant and 0 points to the other or 0.5 points to each participant in case of a draw). Therefore, the total number of points distributed among these 9 participants in their games is 36 points.        - **Calculation:** Each of the 9 participants scored no more than 4 points, and since the total distributed points are 36, if each participant had maximized, they could get exactly 4 points in this “subtournament”. 4. Since it’s stated that they each have at most 4 points, we conclude that all of their points come from the games played among the nine participants themselves.    - **Implication:** This means that they must have each scored exactly 4 points from these games and lost all games they played against the remaining 3 players, including Petya. 5. Since Petya scored exactly 9 points, he must have obtained these points from his 11 games:    - Petya would have earned 9 points from his 11 games, and he got 4 points from beating all 9 participants who scored no more than 4 points each since they each lost their game against him. 6. Therefore, the remaining 9 - 4 = 5 points must have resulted from his games against the remaining two participants and any other games he played. 7. Since a win is worth 1 point and a draw is worth 0.5 points, we analyze Petya’s remaining 2 games:        - If Petya had won any of these games, he would have scored more than 9 points since he already collected full points from the 9 participants.    - Therefore, Petya did not win either of the remaining two games. 8. Given that Petya did not draw either game, as getting any points would exceed 9, he must have lost both games against the remaining two participants.        - **Conclusion:** Petya lost the two remaining games. # Conclusion: Petya lost both of his remaining games.  boxed{text{Petya lost both}}"},{"instruction":"Let   ABC  be a triangle with   BC > AC > AB .

Describe Lena's optimal strategy and calculate the annual income she can earn from her cooperation with the bank (in rubles).","output":"1. **Initial Calculations and Strategy Setup**:        Lena receives a monthly salary of 50,000 rubles and spends 45,000 rubles. Therefore, she saves 5,000 rubles each month.        To maximize her income, Lena needs to use her bank's products effectively. She has a deposit account with a 1% monthly interest rate, a debit card with 8% annual interest on the minimum balance, and a credit card with a limit of 100,000 rubles and a 3% commission on withdrawals or transfers.     2. **Deposit Savings**:    Lena should utilize the deposit account for savings as it has the highest return rate among the available bank products. Each month, after receiving her salary on the 6th, she will immediately transfer the 5,000 rubles she saves to this deposit account.        The accumulated savings in the deposit account are subject to compound interest, calculated as follows:        [    P_{text{total}} = 5000 sum_{k=0}^{11} (1.01)^k    ]    Evaluating the sum:        [    sum_{k=0}^{11} (1.01)^k = 1 + 1.01 + 1.01^2 + ldots + 1.01^{11}    ]        This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and common ratio r = 1.01. The sum of the first 12 terms of a geometric series is given by:        [    S_n = frac{a (1-r^n)}{1-r} = frac{1 (1 - 1.01^{12})}{1 - 1.01}    ]    Plugging in the values:        [    S_{12} = frac{1 - 1.01^{12}}{0.01}    ]        Using approximate values:    [    1.01^{12} approx 1.1268    ]        [    S_{12} approx frac{1 - 1.1268}{0.01} = frac{-0.1268}{-0.01} = 12.68    ]        Therefore:        [    P_{text{total}} = 5000 times 12.68 = 63,400 text{ rubles}    ]        Contributing ( 5000 ) rubles every month and earning interest on it, the total income after a year:    [    text{Interest} = 63,400 - (5000 times 12) = 63,400 - 60,000 = 3,400 text{ rubles}    ]     3. **Debit Card Strategy**:    The remaining 45,000 rubles are used for monthly expenses. Because the debit card interest is based on the minimum balance, Lena needs to keep a 45,000 ruble minimum balance to optimize returns.        Since Lena will transfer the salary to the debit card and only use the credit card for expenditures to keep the debit card balance intact, she will gain interest on the 45,000 rubles on the debit card:        Annual interest calculation on the debit card:        [    I_{text{debit}} = 45,000 times 0.08 = 3,600 text{ rubles}    ] 4. **Credit Card Usage**:    Lena will use the credit card to meet her monthly expenses with a punctual debt repayment before the due date (7th of each month) to avoid extra fees. This allows her salary to remain on the debit card for the whole month.     5. **Final Annual Income Calculation**:    By combining the earnings from the deposit and debit card:        [    text{Total Annual Income} = 3,400 (text{from deposit}) + 3,600 (text{from debit card}) = 7,000 text{ rubles}    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{7,000 text{ rubles}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find out how much it costs to buy one set of desk and chair of type A and one set of desk and chair of type B.","output":"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step: 1.

According to the problem, if we buy 4 sets of type A and 5 sets of type B, the total cost is 1820. This can be represented by the equation: [4x + 5(x + 40) = 1820] 3. Let's solve the equation step by step: begin{align*} 4x + 5(x + 40) &= 1820  4x + 5x + 200 &= 1820  9x + 200 &= 1820  9x &= 1620  x &= 180 end{align*} 4.

Thus, the proof is complete.

The total sum of all flat angles in a tetrahedron is the sum of the angles of four triangles, which is (4 times 180^circ = 720^circ). Hence, if the sum of the angles at every vertex is equal, each sum must be (frac{720^circ}{4} = 180^circ). 2. **Statement (6) implies Statement (5):**    This is straightforward. If the sum of the flat angles at each vertex is 180°, then naturally, the sums at all four vertices are equal. 3. **Statement (4) implies Statement (8):**    If the centers of the inscribed and circumscribed spheres coincide, then the point of tangency of the sphere with each face of the tetrahedron lies on the incircle of each triangular face. Each face must then be an acute-angled triangle with the radius of the circumcircle equal to (sqrt{R^2 - r^2}) where (R) is the radius of the circumscribed sphere and (r) is the radius of the inscribed sphere. 4. **Statement (8) implies Statement (4):**    Any perpendicular from the center (O) of the circumscribed sphere to a face will hit the center of the face's circumcircle. If all these circumcircle radii are equal, then (O) must be equidistant from all faces (distance (sqrt{R^2 - r^2})). Thus, (O) is also the center of the inscribed sphere. 5. **Statement (8) implies Statement (6):**    If all triangular faces have the same circumradius, we use geometric properties to show that each set of opposite face angles are equal, summing to 180° for the triangles formed at each vertex. This leads to all exterior angles summing correctly for every vertex. 6. **Statement (6) implies Statement (7):**    The development (or unfolding) of a regular tetrahedron onto a plane will be a set of triangles such that lines through the midpoints (formed by shared edges between triangles) are collinear. This ensures that the development is an acute-angled triangle with medians corresponding to the tetrahedron's edges. 7. **Statement (7) implies Statement (8) and Statement (2), Statement (2) implies Statement (3), Statement (3) implies Statement (1):**    These implications can be observed directly from the regular properties of tetrahedron configurations and standard geometric proofs. 8. **Statement (1) implies Statement (9):**    If all edges and faces are equal, the projections of the tetrahedron onto the planes parallel to any pair of opposite edges will result in symmetrical rectangles due to the equal edge lengths. 9. **Statement (9) implies Statement (7):**    This is evident as the projections (rectangles) ensure the same triangular face sums for development. 10. **Statement (14) implies Statement (3):**    If the sum of the flat angles at any three vertices equals 180°, it necessitates the fourth to have the resulting sum, ensuring all triangular faces must be equivalent equilateral triangles for balance. 11. **Statement (3) implies Statement (14):**    This inference becomes obvious by the sum of flat angles in regular triangles. 12. **Statement (15) implies Statement (3):**    Following a similar approach as in (14), verifications using angle sums and symmetrical properties hold. 13. **Statement (1) implies Statement (11):**    A regular tetrahedron has congruent altitudes due to symmetry in equidistant vertices from opposite faces. 14. **Statement (2) implies Statement (10):**    Pairing opposite edges uniformly extends to forming a rectangular parallelepiped. 15. **Statement (10) implies Statement (12):**    Within a rectangular parallelepiped, the simultaneous median intersections align with sphere center per conditions in (10). 16. **Statement (12) implies Statement (10):**    The center of the inscribed sphere coinciding with all diagonal halves implies regularity extending to rectangular parallelepiped formations. 17. **Statement (13) implies Statement (11):**    Equality of radians and regular divisions ensure the spherical center coinciding fits with uniform axioms guaranteeing equal altitudes. **Conclusion:** All these properties basically characterize a regular tetrahedron as being equivalently expressible by the given statements and their mutual implications. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given a quadratic function of y with respect to x, y=2mx^{2}+left(1mright)x1m, which of the following conclusions is correct? ① When m=1, the coordinates of the vertex of the function graph are (frac{1}{2},frac{1}{2}); ② When mneq 0, the function graph always passes through a fixed point; ③ When m gt 0, the length of the segment intercepted by the function graph on the xaxis is greater than frac{3}{2}; ④ If any two different points P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2}) are taken on the function graph, then when m lt 0, the inequality frac{{y}_{2}{y}_{1}}{{x}_{2}{x}_{1}} lt 0  is always true for  x gt frac{1}{4}.

Can we start from the configuration where every square is in its place and end at the configuration where 15 and 14 are swapped while the others remain in place? We specify that a move consists of moving the hole to a neighboring horizontal or vertical space.","output":"1. **Initial and Final Parities:**    Consider the configurations of the Taquin game. The starting configuration is where all squares are in their original positions from 1 to 15, with one empty space. The final configuration is where we have exchanged the positions of squares 14 and 15, leaving all other squares in place.    Next, observe the concept of parity (evenness or oddness) in permutations. At the beginning, the puzzle is in an ordered state with an even permutation (parity is even). Swap any two squares (in this case, 14 and 15), and we alter the parity from even to odd. Therefore, we need an odd permutation to transition from an even-numbered initial state to an odd-numbered final state. 2. **Signature and Transpositions:**    Each move in the Taquin game can be considered a transposition, i.e., swapping two adjacent squares by moving the empty space. Each transposition changes the permutation's signature by -1 (an odd permutation). This means every move switches parity between odd and even.    Given that changing the permutation of the squares involves repeatedly altering the parity through transpositions, an odd number of moves must accompany the parity shift from even (initial) to odd (final). 3. **Chessboard Coloring Argument:**    To understand the movement of the empty space, imagine coloring the positions on the 4x4 grid in the style of a chessboard where alternate squares are of different colors.    - Color the squares alternately with two colors, say black and white, such that no two adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically) have the same color.    - Given this coloring, any legal move of the empty space (a movement to a neighbor square) results in the empty space transitioning from one color to the other.    At every move, the empty space changes from a black square to a white square or vice versa. Consequently, if the empty space starts on a black square, it must return to a black square after an even number of moves and to a white square after an odd number of moves. 4. **Initial and Final Colors:**    In the starting configuration, note whether the empty space's position (e.g., bottom-right corner) is on a black or white square. In the desired final configuration (after swapping 14 and 15), the empty space should still occupy a square of the same color as initially.    Since moving the empty space changes its color each time, ending up on the same colored square indicates an even number of moves. This contradicts the requirement from the permutation parity argument wherein an odd number of moves is needed to reach the final state. **Conclusion:** This contradiction implies that there is no sequence of legitimate moves that can transform the initial configuration into the final one while obeying the puzzle's constraints. Hence, it is impossible to achieve the goal of swapping the positions of the 14 and 15 squares (without disturbing the positions of the other squares) in the Taquin game.

The sum of the interior angles of an ( n )-sided polygon is given by the formula:    [    text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^circ cdot (n-2).    ]    This is derived from the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is ((n-2) cdot 180^circ). 3. In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than ( 180^circ ). 4. Next, note that each parallelogram within the polygon contributes four angles that sum to ( 360^circ ) (since the sum of angles in any quadrilateral is ( 360^circ )). 5. Let's count the angles in another way: For each side of the polygon, there are exactly two angles from the parallelograms that are adjacent to that side. This is because each side of the polygon is shared by two parallelograms.

Therefore, each of these vertices contributes less than ( 180^circ ) individually but fit into the overall calculation for the parallelogram sum. There must be at least ( lceil frac{360^circ}{180^circ} rceil = 2 ) such vertices in any configuration, but due to the requirement of forming convex shapes through triangulation and division into parallelograms, at least three good vertices are necessary to maintain the overall shape. 10.

The safest time to start would be right after the initial eruption, which is at 1 pm (13:00).    - From 13:00 to 14:00, it's safe (because the first crater just erupted and will be silent for 17 hours).     - He will have 20 hours of non-eruption from the first crater (from 13:00 to 9:00 the next day), while his total journey only requires 16 hours. 6. **Path Timing with Second Crater:**    To ensure Vanya doesn’t hit the eruption of the second crater while on the path:    - He can safely travel the path 8 hours from when he hits it. Since the initial eruptions are synced, starting at 13:00 means he will hit the path at approximately 17:00 (13:00 + 4 hours).    - By starting at 13:00, he will therefore avoid any eruption of the second crater on the path since the next eruption cycle for the second crater will be at 22:00, beyond the critical 8-hour window. 7. **Computation of All Times Aligning:**        We check if starting at 38 hours after the eruptions sync up will hit any eruptions. 8. **Confirming 50-hour synchronization:**    The least common multiple of 18 and 10 is 90. This means the eruptions only sync together every 90 hours if Vanya ensures he remains within a synchronized safety window from the initial start point.    So, starting at 38 past any synchronized hourly mark combined with the ensuring crater-specific eruption windows and total non-eruption journey time confirms safety parameters—for example, starting at the end of 37th hour, start of 38th hour from any cycle point (such as starting from 50-hour cycles).

We can rewrite the equation as: 3S/6 + 2S/6 + 4 = S Combining the fractions gives us: (3S + 2S)/6 + 4 = S 5S/6 + 4 = S To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6: 6 * (5S/6) + 6 * 4 = 6 * S 5S + 24 = 6S Now, we subtract 5S from both sides to solve for S: 5S - 5S + 24 = 6S - 5S 24 = S So, there are boxed{24}  students in the class."},{"instruction":"Given 2017 points distributed on a circle, each point being labeled either +1 or 1, if from any point onward, in any direction around the circle to any other point, the sum of the numbers passed through is always positive, then that point is called good. Prove that if the points labeled 1 do not exceed 672, then there is at least one good point on the circle.","output":"# Problem Statement: Given 2017 points distributed on the circumference of a circle, each marked with +1 or -1. If starting from any point and moving in any direction around the circle, the sum of the values of the points passed is always a positive number, we call that point a \\"good\\" point. Prove that if the number of points marked -1 is at most 672, then there is at least one good point on the circumference.  The problem can be generalized as follows: for (3n + 1) points where (n) of them are marked as -1, it must be shown that there exists at least one good point on the circle. 1. **Base Case: (n = 1):**     - When (n = 1), there are (3n + 1 = 4) points, one of which is marked -1, and the remaining three are marked +1.      - The possible arrangements are three +1 marks surrounding one -1 mark.     - Since the total sum of the values is (+2), which is positive, moving in any direction will always yield a positive sum.     - Therefore, there is at least one good point. The clearest good point could be any +1 point, achieving the condition trivially. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**     - Assume that for (n = k), with (3k+1) points and (k) marked -1, there exists at least one good point. 3. **Inductive Step: Prove for (n = k + 1):**     - For (n = k + 1), we have (3(k+1)+1 = 3k + 4) points, where (k + 1) are marked -1.      - Identify one -1 point, denoted as (A). Note that in the case of (3k + 4) points, there are enough points so that adjacent to any -1 point, there must exist a +1 point location, denoted (B) and (C), such that (B) and (C) are each positioned one step away from (A).     - Remove these three points (A, B, C). This results in the configuration reducing from (3(k+1) + 1) points to a smaller instance of (3k + 1) points, having (k) -1 points.     - By the inductive hypothesis, within this reduced setup of (3k + 1) points and (k) -1 points, a good point exists. 4. **Conclusion:**     - Thus, by mathematical induction, the assumption can be affirmed for every (n) such that (n leq 672).     - Specifically, for the given problem with 672 -1 marks among 2017 points ((2017 = 3 cdot 672 + 1)), it fulfills the condition that there is assuredly at least one good point on the circle.

These intersections can be visualized in a grid layout. 4. **Street Calculation**:     - If the tourist visits each new intersection just once, the total number of streets passed including the starting point will be number of intersections minus one:      [     text{Number of Streets} = 36 - 1 = 35 text{ streets}     ]     This is the theoretical maximum streets covered without passing the same intersection again. 5. **Route Constraints**:     - To determine if 35 streets can indeed be covered whilst conforming to tourist constraints, consider the pattern of movement.     - Each new street leads to a different intersection and alternates between intersections. 6. **Coloring Argument**:     - Color the intersections in a checkerboard sequence. For simplicity, let’s categorize all intersections into two sets:         - Color black and color white, in a grid pattern (like a chessboard).     - According to the coloring, each move from one intersection to another will change the color of the intersection the tourist is on.     - The starting intersection (A) and the ending intersection (B) are both on white intersections in the diagram provided. 7. **Route Parity Constraint**:     - With (A) and (B) both white, the number of streets for any valid route must be even since it begins and ends on the same color.     - However, 35 is an odd number which invalidates any possibility for the tourist to cover exactly 35 streets without repeating an intersection. 8. **Conclusion**:     - Since only even numbers of street can validate starting and ending at white, the highest valid number without repeating intersections is thus (34).

Considering the sum's constraint, and since it must be divisible by (99999) and smaller than (2 times 99999), this sum must equal exactly (99999). 8.

Let's call this new quantity of rice Q kg. So, we have: M = Q kg * 0.75x (new price per kilo) Since M is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: 30 kg * x = Q kg * 0.75x Now, we can solve for Q: Q = (30 kg * x) / (0.75x) The x terms cancel out: Q = 30 kg / 0.75 Q = 30 kg / (3/4) Q = 30 kg * (4/3) Q = 40 kg So, with the same amount of money, you can now buy boxed{40}  kg of rice at the new reduced price."},{"instruction":"spherical coordinates (rho,theta,phi), describe the shape defined by the equations [rho = c] for a constant c > 0.

Then the segment DY will equal the segment DX because both X and Y are midpoints of segments connecting D to P. 2. **Parallelogram Formation**:     Note that the quadrilateral ( DYPX ) forms a parallelogram because the diagonals bisect each other.

Since one of these statements must be true and the other false, we consider two cases:    - Case 1: If Sasha's second statement is true (the number is less than 27), then his first statement (divisibility by 13) must be false. We need to check if any such number meets the criteria of other boys' statements.    - Case 2: If Sasha's first statement is true (divisibility by 13), then his second statement (less than 27) must be false.

But \`18\` does not satisfy Андрей's statements (ends in 6, divisible by 7). Hence, contradiction arises, meaning Case 1 is not valid. 4. Consider Case 2 (The number is divisible by 13):      - Possible two-digit numbers divisible by 13 are: 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, and 91.    - Since Sasha's second statement (less than 27) is false, the number must be greater than or equal to 27. Hence, valid options narrow down to: 39, 52, 65, 78, and 91.    - Among these, we need to validate Боря's statements:      - Statement 1: The number is greater than 26 (consistently true within our valid options),      - Statement 2: Does not end in 8 (valid options are confirmed since none end in 8). 5.

A alone can do it in 15 days. They work together for the entire duration of the work, and B should be paid Rs 3333. What is the total wages for the work?","output":"To find the total wages for the work, we first need to determine the portion of the work each person completes and then allocate the wages accordingly. B can complete the work in 10 days, which means B's daily work rate is 1/10 of the work per day. A can complete the work in 15 days, which means A's daily work rate is 1/15 of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined daily work rate is: (1/10) + (1/15) = (3/30) + (2/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 of the work per day. This means that A and B together can complete the work in 6 days. Now, let's find out the ratio of the work done by A and B when they work together: A's share of work per day: 1/15 B's share of work per day: 1/10 The ratio of A's work to B's work per day is: (1/15) / (1/10) = (1/15) * (10/1) = 10/15 = 2/3 So, for every 2 units of work A does, B does 3 units of work. The total units of work done by A and B together is 2 + 3 = 5 units. Now, we know that B should be paid Rs 3333 for his share of the work, which corresponds to 3 units of the total 5 units of work done by both. To find the value of 1 unit of work, we divide B's wages by 3: Rs 3333 / 3 = Rs 1111 per unit of work. Now, to find the total wages for the entire work (5 units), we multiply the value per unit by the total units of work: Rs 1111 * 5 = Rs 5555.

Notice that if ( x a equiv y a pmod{p} ), then:          x a - y a equiv 0 pmod{p}           which implies:          (x - y) a equiv 0 pmod{p}      2. **Step 2: Understanding Divisibility**     Since ( (x - y)a equiv 0 pmod{p} ), we can say that ( p ) divides ( (x - y)a ). Because ( p ) is a prime number and ( a ) is not divisible by ( p ), ( a ) has a multiplicative inverse modulo ( p ). According to the properties of prime numbers and gcd (greatest common divisor), since ( p ) and ( a ) are coprime, this implies:          gcd(a, p) = 1           This means ( a ) and ( p ) are relatively prime.      3. **Step 3: Canceling the Common Factor**     Given that ( p mid (x - y)a ) and knowing that ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), it follows that ( p mid (x - y) ). Therefore, ( x - y ) must be a multiple of ( p ). 4. **Step 4: Analyzing the Range of ( x ) and ( y )**     Since ( x ) and ( y ) are confined to the range ( 1 leq x, y leq p - 1 ), the only possible multiple of ( p ) within this range is zero (since ( x ) and ( y ) can only be between 1 and ( p-1 )). Thus, we have:          x - y = 0 quad Rightarrow quad x = y       5. **Conclusion: Uniqueness of Remainders**     This implies that if ( x neq y ), ( xa notequiv ya pmod{p} ). Therefore, the remainders ( {a, 2a, 3a, ldots, (p-1)a} ) modulo ( p ) are all distinct. Since there are ( p-1 ) numbers in this set and they all yield distinct remainders when taken modulo ( p ), each number ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ) must appear exactly once as a remainder. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find the molecular weight of a compound with the formula N2O5.

The expected change in the number of heads can be calculated based on the given probabilities. Let's denote X as the random variable representing the number of heads after one strike.

If such q exists, find its value.","output":"(1) From f(2) < f(3), we know the power function f(x) = x^{-k^2 + k + 2} must be an increasing function. Therefore, we have the inequality -k^2 + k + 2 > 0. Solving this inequality: begin{align*} -k^2 + k + 2 &> 0  k^2 - k - 2 &< 0  (k-2)(k+1) &< 0 end{align*} Thus, -1 < k < 2. Since k in mathbb{Z}, we have two possible values for k: k = 0 or k = 1. For k = 1, the function becomes f(x) = x^2. (2) The function g(x) then becomes g(x) = 1 - qx^2 + (2q-1)x. The axis of symmetry for the parabola defined by g(x) is at x = frac{2q-1}{2q} = 1 - frac{1}{2q}. Since q > 0, we have 1 - frac{1}{2q} < 1. When 1 - frac{1}{2q} > -1, or equivalently q > frac{1}{4}, we find the maximum value of g(x) to be: g_{max} = gleft(1 - frac{1}{2q}right) = frac{4q^2 + 1}{4q} Setting this equal to frac{17}{8}, we solve for q: frac{4q^2 + 1}{4q} = frac{17}{8} This yields q = 2 or q = frac{1}{8} (which we discard). At this time, evaluating g(x) at the endpoints: begin{align*} g(-1) &= -q(-1)^2 + (2q-1)(-1) + 1 = -4  g(2) &= -q(2)^2 + (2q-1)(2) + 1 = -1 end{align*} The minimum value is -4, which fits the requirement. When 1 - frac{1}{2q} leq -1, or equivalently q leq frac{1}{4}, the maximum of g(x) would be g_{max} = g(-1) = -3q + 2, and the minimum would be g_{min} = g(2) = -1, which does not meet the conditions of the problem. Therefore, there exists a positive number boxed{q = 2} which ensures that the function g(x) = 1 - qf(x) + (2q-1)x has a range of [-4, frac{17}{8}] on the interval [-1, 2]."},{"instruction":"Prove that among  20  consecutive positive integers there is an integer  d  such that for every positive integer  n  the following inequality holds   n sqrt{d} left{n sqrt {d} right } > dfrac{5}{2}   where by  left {x right }  denotes the fractional part of the real number  x .

Note that ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ) implies ( x > 2 ) and ( x ) is not a perfect square.    - Write ( x = a^2 + b ) with ( (a, b) in mathbb{N}^2 ) and ( b leq 2a ).    - Then, ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ) if and only if ( a^2 + b - a sqrt{a^2 + b} > frac{5}{2} ).    - This simplifies to ( a^2 + b - frac{5}{2} > sqrt{(a^2)^2 + a^2 b} ).    - Squaring both sides, we get ( (b - frac{5}{2})^2 > (5 - b) a^2 ). 4. **Analyzing the Inequality:**    - If ( b leq 4 ), then ( frac{(b - frac{5}{2})^2}{5 - b} leq (b - frac{5}{2})^2 leq frac{9}{4} < 4 leq (2b)^2 ), so ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ) cannot hold.    - If ( b geq 5 ), then any such ( x ) satisfies ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ). 5. **Application to the Problem:**    - Consider ( x = n^2 d ) for ( d ) non-square. For any ( (n, d) in mathbb{N}^2 ), we can write ( n^2 d = a_{n,d}^2 + b_{n,d} ) with ( b_{n,d} leq 2a_{n,d} ).    - According to the lemma, the problem asks for a sequence ( d_1 < d_2 < cdots ) of naturals such that ( d_{k+1} - d_k leq 20 ) and ( min_{n,k} { b_{n, d_k} } geq 5 ). 6. **Choosing ( d ):**    - The condition ( b_{n,d} geq 5 ) is satisfied if ( d ) is non-square and ( -1, -2, -3, -4 ) are quadratic non-residues modulo ( d ).    - This is true for any ( d ) satisfying ( d equiv 3 pmod{4} ) and ( d equiv 0 pmod{5} ), i.e., for ( d equiv 15 pmod{20} ). 7. **Conclusion:**    - Among any 20 consecutive positive integers, there is always an integer ( d ) such that ( d equiv 15 pmod{20} ).    - For such ( d ), the inequality ( n sqrt{d} left{ n sqrt{d} right} > frac{5}{2} ) holds for every positive integer ( n ).

Since (c > 2), we have (c/2 > 1). The series (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^p}) converges for (p > 1). Therefore, (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^{c/2}}) converges. 3. **Defining a Bound:**    - Let (C = sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^{c/2}}). Since the series is convergent, (C) is a finite positive number. 4. **Using the Given Conditions to Bound (a(n)):**    - We will use induction and the given conditions to show that (a(n)) is bounded by a constant multiple of (C^2). 5. **Base Case:**    - For (n = 2^k), we have (a(2^k) leq frac{1}{(k+1)^c}). 6. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that for all (m < n), (a(m) leq 2C^2).    - We need to show that (a(n) leq 2C^2).    - Write (n) in binary form: (n = 2^{i_1} + 2^{i_2} + cdots + 2^{i_k}) where (i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_k).    - Using the given condition (a(m+n) leq 2a(m) + 2a(n)), we can recursively apply this to break down (a(n)) into sums of (a(2^i)). 7. **Bounding (a(n)) Using the Binary Representation:**    - For (n = 2^{i_1} + 2^{i_2} + cdots + 2^{i_k}), we have:      [      a(n) leq 2(a(2^{i_1}) + a(2^{i_2}) + cdots + a(2^{i_k}))      ]    - Using the bound (a(2^i) leq frac{1}{(i+1)^c}), we get:      [      a(n) leq 2 left( frac{1}{(i_1+1)^c} + frac{1}{(i_2+1)^c} + cdots + frac{1}{(i_k+1)^c} right)      ] 8. **Summing the Series:**    - Since (i_1, i_2, ldots, i_k) are distinct and each term (frac{1}{(i+1)^c}) is part of the convergent series (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^c}), we can bound the sum by (C):      [      a(n) leq 2 sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{1}{(i+1)^c} leq 2C      ] 9. **Final Bound:**    - Since (C) is a finite constant, we have:      [      a(n) leq 2C^2      ]    - Therefore, the sequence (a(n)) is bounded by (2C^2).

To find the maximum number of intersection points formed by these lines, we start by considering the maximum number of intersection points for 100 lines without any specific properties: 1. **Total possible intersections without restrictions:**    Each pair of lines can intersect in exactly one point. Therefore, the number of intersection points for 100 lines is given by the number of ways to choose 2 out of 100 lines:    [    binom{100}{2} = frac{100 cdot 99}{2} = 4950    ] 2. **Accounting for parallel lines:**    For the lines of the form (L_{4n}):    - There are 25 such lines (since (100/4 = 25)).    - Since these lines are parallel, they do not intersect with each other. Thus, they contribute no intersection points among themselves.    The reduction in the number of intersections due to these parallel lines can be calculated by:    [    binom{25}{2} = frac{25 cdot 24}{2} = 300    ] 3. **Accounting for lines passing through a common point:**    For the lines of the form (L_{4n-3}):    - There are also 25 such lines.    - All these lines intersect at exactly one point, the point (A). Hence, the number of intersection points among these lines is reduced to just that single point (A).    The intersections among these lines without the common point constraint would have been:    [    binom{25}{2} = 300    ]    Since all these lines intersect at (A), we must subtract (300-1=299) intersections. 4. **Combining all reductions:**    The adjusted total number of intersections is then calculated by considering the parallel lines and the lines passing through the common point:    [    4950 - 300 - 299 = 4351    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of intersection points for the given 100 lines is: ( boxed{4351} )"},{"instruction":"Show that for all (x, y > 0), the following inequality holds: [ frac{x}{x^{4} + y^{2}} + frac{y}{x^{2} + y^{4}} leq frac{1}{xy} ]","output":"1. **Rewriting the Expression:**    We start with the given inequality:    [    frac{x}{x^4 + y^2} + frac{y}{x^2 + y^4}    ] 2. **Applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality:**    Recall that for any non-negative real numbers (a) and (b), the AM-GM inequality states:    [    frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}    ]    Applying AM-GM to (x^4) and (y^2):    [    x^4 + y^2 geq 2 sqrt{x^4 y^2}    ]    Since (x, y > 0):    [    sqrt{x^4 y^2} = x^2 y quad Rightarrow quad x^4 + y^2 geq 2 x^2 y    ] 3. **Forming the First Term:**    Considering the first term ( frac{x}{x^4 + y^2} ):    [    frac{x}{x^4 + y^2} leq frac{x}{2 x^2 y} = frac{1}{2xy}    ] 4. **Applying AM-GM Again:**    Similarly, applying AM-GM to (x^2) and (y^4):    [    x^2 + y^4 geq 2 sqrt{x^2 y^4}    ]    Since (x, y > 0):    [    sqrt{x^2 y^4} = xy^2 quad Rightarrow quad x^2 + y^4 geq 2 xy^2    ] 5. **Forming the Second Term:**    Considering the second term ( frac{y}{x^2 + y^4} ):    [    frac{y}{x^2 + y^4} leq frac{y}{2 xy^2} = frac{1}{2xy}    ] 6. **Combining the Two Terms:**    Adding the two fractions:    [    frac{x}{x^4 + y^2} + frac{y}{x^2 + y^4} leq frac{1}{2xy} + frac{1}{2xy} = frac{1}{xy}    ] # Conclusion:    Hence, we have proven that:    [    frac{x}{x^4 + y^2} + frac{y}{x^2 + y^4} leq frac{1}{xy}    ]    (boxed{frac{x}{x^4 + y^2} + frac{y}{x^2 + y^4} leq frac{1}{xy}})"},{"instruction":"There are values A and B such that [frac{Bx11}{x^27x+10}=frac{A}{x2}+frac{3}{x5}.]Find A+B.","output":"To solve the given problem, let's break it down into detailed steps: 1. **Factor the Denominator and Rewrite the Equation:** Given the equation [frac{Bx-11}{x^2-7x+10}=frac{A}{x-2}+frac{3}{x-5},] we first factor the denominator on the left-hand side.

First, we need to analyze the information given in the problem. They state that triangles ( triangle ABH ) and ( triangle CDE ) are equal in area, and that the ratio of the segments ( frac{AE}{BE} = frac{DH}{CH} ). 2. Based on these equality conditions, we begin by recognizing the property that the area of a triangle is proportional to its base for a given height. This can be formulated using the fact that the height from a shared vertex to the base is common. 3. Let's consider the specific triangles involved. For the triangles ( triangle AEH ) and ( triangle BEH ), we know that if ( frac{AE}{BE} = frac{DH}{CH} ), then the line segment ( EH ) (a common height) divides the areas of these triangles in the same ratio as it divides their bases. 4. Formally, we can express this using areas:        frac{S_{triangle AEH}}{S_{triangle BEH}} = frac{AE}{BE}     5. Similarly, looking at triangles ( triangle EDH ) and ( triangle ECH ) given:        frac{S_{triangle EDH}}{S_{triangle ECH}} = frac{DH}{CH}     6. Since ( frac{AE}{BE} = frac{DH}{CH} ), we can understand that:        frac{S_{triangle AEH}}{S_{triangle BEH}} = frac{S_{triangle EDH}}{S_{triangle ECH}}     7. Knowing that ( S_{triangle ABH} = S_{triangle CDE} ), it implies that the common height line ( EH ) divides the areas equally between ( triangle ABH ) and ( triangle CDE ). 8. Since the areas ( S_{triangle BEH} = S_{triangle CEH} ) and they have the same height from ( EH ), the bases ( BE ) and ( CE ) must be equal. 9. Thus, triangles ( triangle BEH ) and ( triangle CEH ) have equal areas:        S_{triangle BEH} = S_{triangle CEH}     10. This implies their heights from ( EH ) to points ( B ) and ( C ) respectively must be equal. Therefore, points ( B ) and ( C ) must be equidistant from the line ( EH ), making ( BC ) parallel to ( EH ). 11. Analyzing similarly for ( AD ):     - Consider the areas of ( triangle AEH ) and ( triangle DEH ):              S_{triangle AEH} = S_{triangle DEH}            - With the same logic as above, we see points ( A ) and ( D ) are equidistant and therefore parallel to ( EH ). 12.

Given that the sum with the fifth score must be a multiple of 5 and that the scores are different, we examine these possibilities: - If the sum is 20 (the smallest possible sum that fits), then the sum of the four scores is (20 - 5 = 15). However, there is no way to choose four distinct numbers from (S) that sum to 15. - If the sum is 25, then the sum of the four scores is (25 - 5 = 20), which is possible with the numbers (1, 2, 8, 9) (since they are distinct and sum to 20). Thus, the sum of the scores from the first test to the fourth test must be 20, with the possible scores being (1, 2, 8, 9). If the fourth test score must be higher than the fifth (which was 5), the possible fourth test scores from our set are 8 or 9. Since there are only two options and the problem asks for one score, we can conclude that his score on the fourth test was either 8 or 9, which translates back to (8+84=92) or (9+84=93). As both are possible without further information, we consider both.

Consider the point ( (a, 0) ) with ( a > 1 ). Construct the lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) that are perpendicular to each other and intersect ( C ) at points ( P, Q ) and ( R, S ) respectively. 3. First, analyze when ( l_1 ) is vertical and thus ( l_2 ) must be horizontal.     - Let ( l_1: x = a ).     - The points of intersection of ( l_1 ) with ( C ) are obtained by solving ( a^2 - y^2 = 1 ):       [       y^2 = a^2 - 1 Rightarrow y = pm sqrt{a^2 - 1}       ]       Hence, ( P_0(a, sqrt{a^2 - 1}) ) and ( Q_0(a, -sqrt{a^2 - 1}) ).     - Let ( l_2: y = 0 ).     - The points of intersection of ( l_2 ) with ( C ) are ( R_0(1, 0) ) and ( S_0(-1, 0) ). 4.

Mark has 35 flowers in his garden. What is the percentage of green flowers compared to yellow and purple flowers?","output":"First, let's find out how many purple flowers there are. If there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, we can calculate this by taking the number of yellow flowers and multiplying by 80%. Number of yellow flowers = 10 Percentage increase for purple flowers = 80% of 10 = 0.80 * 10 = 8 So, there are 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers. To find the total number of purple flowers: Number of purple flowers = Number of yellow flowers + Additional purple flowers Number of purple flowers = 10 + 8 = 18 Now, we know there are 10 yellow flowers, 18 purple flowers, and a total of 35 flowers in the garden. To find the number of green flowers: Number of green flowers = Total number of flowers - (Number of yellow flowers + Number of purple flowers) Number of green flowers = 35 - (10 + 18) Number of green flowers = 35 - 28 Number of green flowers = 7 To find the percentage of green flowers compared to yellow and purple flowers, we'll add the number of yellow and purple flowers and then divide the number of green flowers by that sum, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Total number of yellow and purple flowers = 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) = 28 Percentage of green flowers = (Number of green flowers / Total number of yellow and purple flowers) * 100 Percentage of green flowers = (7 / 28) * 100 Percentage of green flowers = 0.25 * 100 Percentage of green flowers = 25% So, the percentage of green flowers compared to yellow and purple flowers is boxed{25%} ."},{"instruction":"Let  p,q,rin R   with  pqr=1 .

Using the fact that w^6 = 1, we can simplify the powers of w: [ w^{120} = (w^6)^{20} = 1, quad w^{121} = w^{120} cdot w = w, quad w^{122} = w^{120} cdot w^2 = w^2, ] [ w^{123} = w^{120} cdot w^3 = w^3, quad w^{124} = w^{120} cdot w^4 = w^4. ] Therefore,  [ w^{120} + w^{121} + w^{122} + w^{123} + w^{124} = 1 + w + w^2 + w^3 + w^4. ] Given w^6 = 1, and the polynomial w^6 + w^4 + w^2 = 0, we know w^4 = -w^2 - 1 using w^6=1.

We need to find all ( b ) such that the equation ( f_a(x) = b ) has exactly one solution. The derivative of ( f_a(x) ) is:    [    f'_a(x) = frac{2x}{1 + x^2} - a    ] 2. **Case ( a = 0 ):**    If ( a = 0 ), then ( f_0(x) = ln(1 + x^2) ). This function is even, i.e., ( f_0(x) = f_0(-x) ), and for ( x > 0 ), ( f_0(x) > f_0(0) ). Therefore, the only ( b ) for which ( f_0(x) = b ) has exactly one solution is ( b = f_0(0) = ln(1 + 0^2) = 0 ). 3. **Case ( a neq 0 ):**    Assume ( a neq 0 ). We analyze the behavior of ( f_a(x) ) as ( x to pm infty ):    - If ( a > 0 ):      [      lim_{x to -infty} f_a(x) = lim_{x to -infty} left( ln(1 + x^2) - ax right) = +infty      ]      [      lim_{x to +infty} f_a(x) = lim_{x to +infty} left( ln(1 + x^2) - ax right) = -infty      ]    - If ( a < 0 ):      [      lim_{x to +infty} f_a(x) = lim_{x to +infty} left( ln(1 + x^2) - ax right) = +infty      ]      [      lim_{x to -infty} f_a(x) = lim_{x to -infty} left( ln(1 + x^2) - ax right) = -infty      ]    Therefore, ( f_a(x) ) has a range equal to the entire ( mathbb{R} ). 4. **Monotonicity and injectivity:**    We analyze the derivative ( f'_a(x) = frac{2x}{1 + x^2} - a ):    - Since ( |2x| leq 1 + x^2 ), we have ( -1 leq frac{2x}{1 + x^2} leq 1 ).    - If ( |a| > 1 ), then ( f'_a(x) ) is either always positive or always negative, making ( f_a(x) ) strictly monotonic and hence injective. Therefore, ( f_a(x) = b ) has exactly one solution for any ( b in mathbb{R} ).    - For ( |a| = 1 ):      - If ( a = 1 ), ( f'_1(x) leq 0 ) with equality only at ( x = 1 ).      - If ( a = -1 ), ( f'_{-1}(x) geq 0 ) with equality only at ( x = -1 ).      Thus, ( f_a(x) ) is injective for ( |a| geq 1 ). 5. **Case ( 0 < |a| < 1 ):**    Without loss of generality, consider ( a > 0 ). The critical points of ( f_a(x) ) occur where ( f'_a(x) = 0 ):    [    frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = a implies x = frac{1}{a} pm sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1}    ]    - ( f_a(x) ) is increasing on ( left( frac{1}{a} - sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1}, frac{1}{a} + sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1} right) ) and decreasing otherwise.    - The function ( f_a(x) ) has a local maximum and minimum at these critical points. Therefore, ( f_a(x) = b ) has exactly one solution if ( b ) is outside the interval:      [      left[ f_aleft( frac{1}{a} - sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1} right), f_aleft( frac{1}{a} + sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1} right) right]      ]    - Compute the values:      [      f_aleft( frac{1}{a} - sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1} right) = lnleft( frac{2}{a} left( frac{1}{a} - sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right) - left( frac{1}{a} - sqrt{1 - a^2} right)      ]      [      f_aleft( frac{1}{a} + sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} - 1} right) = lnleft( frac{2}{a} left( frac{1}{a} + sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right) - left( frac{1}{a} + sqrt{1 - a^2} right)      ] 6. **Conclusion:**    For ( a < 0 ), the analysis is similar, and the suitable ( b ) values are those outside the interval:    [    left[ lnleft( frac{2}{|a|} left( frac{1}{|a|} - sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right) - left( frac{1}{|a|} - sqrt{1 - a^2} right), lnleft( frac{2}{|a|} left( frac{1}{|a|} + sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right) - left( frac{1}{|a|} + sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right]    ] The final answer is ( boxed{ (0, 0) } ), all ((a, b)) with (|a| geq 1), and all ((a, b)) with (0 < |a| < 1) and (b notin left[ lnleft( frac{2}{|a|} left( frac{1}{|a|} - sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right) - left( frac{1}{|a|} - sqrt{1 - a^2} right), lnleft( frac{2}{|a|} left( frac{1}{|a|} + sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right) - left( frac{1}{|a|} + sqrt{1 - a^2} right) right] )."},{"instruction":"Define the operation a*b= begin{cases}a & (aleqslant b)  b & (a > b)end{cases}.

This angular measure is taken to be positive if the radius vector (drawn from the center of the circle) points inward towards the paper circle, and negative if it points outward. 4. **Sum of angular measures**: Assign each piece the sum of the angular measures of the arcs on its boundary.

Next, we need to add three more line segments under the constraint that at least one must be parallel to one of the rectangle's sides. 1. Let the first of the three additional line segments be parallel to the shorter side of the rectangle, diving one of the initial halves into two smaller rectangles. This addition increases the region count to 3. 2. Add the second new line segment in such a way that it intersects all previously drawn lines (including the initial MN). By crossing MN and the first additional line vertically, it maximizes new regions, adding two additional parts, increasing the region count from 3 to 5. 3. The final line segment could then be added diagonally from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner, intersecting all previous lines. Each intersection point with an already present line creates a new region. As it crosses three lines, it adds four more regions (one for each section of the newly drawn line itself), making the total number of regions equal to 9.

Take out the trash: 1/6 of the time it takes to do homework, so 30/6 = 5 minutes Now, let's add up the time for these three tasks: Homework + Walk the dog + Take out the trash = 30 + 35 + 5 = 70 minutes Janice has 2 hours (120 minutes) before the movie starts, and she has 35 minutes left.

Verification: When a=0, f'(x)= frac{x-1}{x^{2}}, which satisfies that the function f(x) takes an extreme value at x=1.    Therefore, a=0.    When 0 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0, so the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (0,1);    When x > 1, f'(x) > 0, so the function f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (1,+infty).

Steps and Proof: 1. **Assumption**:    - Suppose the sum ( mathbf{a} ) of the given vectors is not zero. If it were zero, the problem statement would be obvious. 2. **Coordinate System**:    - Introduce a coordinate system with the y-axis directed along vector ( mathbf{a} ).    - Number the vectors in the lower half-plane in a clockwise direction: ( mathbf{e}_{1}, mathbf{e}_{2}, ldots ). 3. **Condition Analysis**:    - There are at least (k) vectors in the considered half-plane.    - We can always find (k) vectors ( mathbf{v}_{1}, ldots, mathbf{v}_{k} ) such that for any ( i = 1, ldots, k ), the vector ( mathbf{v}_{i} + mathbf{e}_{i} ) has a non-positive second coordinate. 4. **Proof of Required Statement**:    - The sum of vectors ( mathbf{e}_{1}, mathbf{v}_{1}, ldots, mathbf{e}_{k}, mathbf{v}_{k} ) has a non-positive second coordinate.    - The second coordinate of any of the remaining ( n - 2k ) vectors does not exceed 1.    - Hence, the second coordinate of the sum of all given vectors does not exceed ( n - 2k ).     5. **Detailed Calculation**:    - Let vectors ( e_{1}, ldots, mathbf{e}_{p} ) lie in the fourth quadrant.    - For each vector in this quadrant, find another vector ( mathbf{v}_{i} ) such that their sum has a non-positive second coordinate.    - Rotate the lower half-plane clockwise from 0^circ to 90^circ, moving the ( O x )-axis:       - When the ( O x )-axis passes over ( mathbf{e}_{1} ), it must include at least one more vector into consideration.       - Follow similar steps to find the vectors sequentially: ( mathbf{v}_{2} ), etc. until ( mathbf{v}_{k} ).    - The remaining vectors ( e_{p+1}, ldots, mathbf{e}_{k} ) lying in the third quadrant are treated similarly, pairing them to ensure the second coordinate remains non-positive collectively.

Therefore, without detailed analysis, we can conclude that the solution set cannot simply be left[0,3right] since x=1 is not included. Thus, **Proposition A is incorrect**. **For Proposition B:** Given the function fleft(xright)=-x^{2}+ax+4, we need to ensure it has two zeros, one greater than 2 and the other less than -1. This leads to two conditions based on the value of the function at these points: 1. f(-1)=3-a＞0 implies that a<3. 2. f(2)=2a＞0 implies that a>0. Combining these conditions, we get 0<a<3. Therefore, the range of a is left(0,3right), making **Proposition B correct**. **For Proposition C:** To compare f(x)=frac{{{x^4}-1}}{{{x^2}+1}} and gleft(xright)=x^{2}-1, we simplify f(x): f(x)=frac{x^4-1}{x^2+1}=frac{(x^2+1)(x^2-1)}{x^2+1}=x^2-1.

Let's assume the total distance of the trip is D. Since the car travels each third of the distance at different speeds, we can divide the distance into three equal parts, each being D/3. For the first third of the distance at 80 km/h: Time taken for the first third = (D/3) / 80 hours For the second third of the distance at 24 km/h: Time taken for the second third = (D/3) / 24 hours For the last third of the distance at 30 km/h: Time taken for the last third = (D/3) / 30 hours Now, let's calculate the time taken for each part: Time for first third = (D/3) / 80 = D / 240 hours Time for second third = (D/3) / 24 = D / 72 hours Time for last third = (D/3) / 30 = D / 90 hours Total time taken for the trip = Time for first third + Time for second third + Time for last third Total time = D / 240 + D / 72 + D / 90 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 240, 72, and 90 is 720.

Рассмотрим число 2013 и найдем сумму его цифр: [ 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 6 ] 2. Вспомним признак делимости на (9): число делится на 9 тогда и только тогда, когда сумма его цифр делится на 9. 3. Пусть мы хотим узнать, сколько раз нужно записать число 2013 подряд, чтобы полученное число делилось на 9. Для этого заметим следующее: если сумма цифр одного числа 2013 равна 6, то сумма цифр (n) таких чисел, записанных подряд, будет равной (6n). Нам нужно, чтобы сумма цифр делилась на 9, то есть (6n) делилось на 9. 4. Поскольку НОД(6, 9) = 3, то (6n) делится на 9, если (n) делится на 3. Следовательно, (n) должно быть кратно 3. 5. Выберем минимальное значение (n = 3). Тогда получаем число, составленное из трех последовательных 2013: [ 201320132013 ] 6. Проверим, что сумма цифр этого числа действительно делится на 9: [ (2 + 0 + 1 + 3) times 3 = 6 times 3 = 18 ] Поскольку 18 делится на 9, то и само число (201320132013), составленное из трех подряд стоящих 2013, делится на 9. 7.

Step 2: Derive a Recurrence for (b_n) To find a recurrence relation for (b_n), note: [ b_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} ] [ a_{n+1} = 2b_n rightarrow b_{n+2} = 2b_n + b_{n+1} ] This allows us to write: [ b_{n+2} - 2b_{n+1} = - (b_{n+1} - 2b_n) ]  Step 3: Identify Sequences and Initial Terms Let: [ u_n = b_{n+1} + b_n quad text{and} quad v_n = b_{n+1} - 2b_n ] Then: [ u_{n+1} = 2u_n quad text{with} quad u_0 = b_1 + b_0 = 1 + 1 = 2 ] [ v_{n+1} = -v_n quad text{with} quad v_0 = b_1 - 2b_0 = 1 - 2 cdot 1 = -1 ]  Step 4: General Formulas for (u_n) and (v_n) We can solve these recurrence relations explicitly: [ u_n = 2^n cdot u_0 = 2^n cdot 2 = 2^{n+1} ] [ v_n = (-1)^n cdot v_0 = (-1)^n cdot (-1) = -(-1)^n ]  Step 5: Solving for (b_n) Using the definitions of (u_n) and (v_n), we have: [ b_{n+1} + b_n = 2^{n+1} quad text{and} quad b_{n+1} - 2b_n = -(-1)^n ] Adding and subtracting these equations: [ 2b_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - (-1)^n quad Rightarrow quad b_{n+1} = frac{1}{2} left( 2^{n+1} - (-1)^n right) ] [ 3b_n = 2^{n+1} + (-1)^n quad Rightarrow quad b_n = frac{1}{3} left( 2^{n+1} + (-1)^n right)  ]  Step 6: Solving for (a_n) Substituting into the recurrence for (a_n): [ a_{n+1} = 2b_n quad Rightarrow quad a_n = 2b_{n-1} ] [ a_n = frac{2}{3} left( 2^n - (-1)^{n-1} right) ]  Step 7: Position on the 2017th Day Given (n=2017): [ a_{2017} = frac{2}{3} left( 2^{2016} - (-1)^{2016} right) = frac{2}{3} left( 2^{2016} - 1 right) ] [ b_{2017} = frac{1}{3} left( 2^{2018} + (-1)^{2017} right) = frac{1}{3} left( 2^{2018} - 1 right) ] Thus, the position on the 2017th day is: [ boxed{left( frac{2}{3} times 2^{2016} - frac{2}{3}, frac{1}{3} times 2^{2017} + frac{1}{3} right)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the parabola y=x^2 and the moving line y=(2t1)xc have common points (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), and x_1^2+x_2^2=t^2+2t3.

The Old Republic imposed sanctions on the Trade Federation for attempting to blockade the peaceful planet of Naboo. 2. As a result, the population of the Republic drastically reduced both exports to and imports from the Trade Federation. 3. Given that both exports and imports have decreased, the demand for and the supply of the Trade Federation's currency should theoretically both decrease. 4. This leads to an indeterminate effect on the equilibrium exchange rate of the Trade Federation's currency because:     - Reduction in exports implies less demand for the Republic’s goods which will reduce the need for Trade Federation’s currency to pay for these goods.     - Reduction in imports implies less demand for foreign goods which will reduce the need for the Republic’s currency.  Conclusion:    - The direction of change in the exchange rate cannot be determined with the given information. Given these alterations in demand and supply, any further volatility in the currency will depend on factors not currently accounted for. Therefore, the net effect on the currency rate can go in either direction or remain neutral. # Part (b) 1. There are primarily two main types of exchange rate regimes in an economy:    - **Floating Exchange Rate:** The Central Bank does not intervene, allowing the currency to be determined by market forces.    - **Fixed Exchange Rate:** The Central Bank intervenes to maintain the currency at a pegged value against another currency or a basket of currencies. 2. Another regime is the **Currency Corridor:** Here, the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate within a predetermined range, and central bank intervention occurs only when the rate approaches the bounds of this corridor. 3. To fix the exchange rate, the Central Bank can use:    - **Monetary Interventions:** Such as changing the money supply.    - **Adjusting Key Interest Rates:** To influence liquidity and investment.    - **Manipulating Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves:** By buying/selling currencies to stabilize their own currency.  Part (c) 1. The decrease in value of the Trade Federation's currency is being studied. 2. Given the current fixed rate of ( E_0 = 90 ) units of Trade Federation's currency per 1 unit of Naboo's currency, and the new rate ( E_1 = 100 ) units post-sanction, the percentage change in the exchange rate is:    [    Delta E = left( frac{E_1 - E_0}{E_0} right) times 100 = left( frac{100 - 90}{90} right) times 100 = frac{10}{90} times 100 = 11.11%    ] 3. To return the currency to its original rate:    - Increase needs to be 11.11% (rounded to 10% for practical purposes).    - Given that a 1% change in money supply corresponds to a 5% change in currency rate.    - Required change in money supply ( Delta M ):    [    x times 5% = 10% implies x = frac{10%}{5%} = 2    ] # Conclusion: - Therefore, the money supply needs to be reduced by (2%). # Part (d) 1. To achieve the necessary change in money supply:    - A change of 1 percentage point (p.p.) in the interest rate results in a 4% change in the money supply. 2.

This duration includes all four ancient time periods mentioned, each lasting for 2 hours. 2. **Observation Shifts**: Since each person observes for 2 hours and there are four students, including Xiao Ming, each student will take one shift, covering the entire observation duration. 3. **\\"Zi Shi\\" Period Duration**: The \\"zi shi\\" period specifically lasts from 23:00 to 1:00, which is a 2-hour duration. 4. **Probability Calculation**: The probability of Xiao Ming observing during the \\"zi shi\\" period can be calculated by dividing the duration of the \\"zi shi\\" period by the total observation duration. This is because each student's shift is determined randomly, making each 2-hour shift equally likely to be assigned to any student. Therefore, the calculation is as follows: text{Probability of Xiao Ming observing during \\"zi shi\\"} = frac{text{Duration of \\"zi shi\\"}}{text{Total observation duration}} = frac{2 text{ hours}}{8 text{ hours}} = frac{1}{4}.

Consider a polynomial ( P ) of degree ( n+1 ):      [      P(x+1) - P(x) = (a(x+1)^{n+1} + Q(x+1)) - (ax^{n+1} + Q(x))      ]      [      = a((n+1)x^n + ldots + 1) + Q(x+1) - Q(x)      ]      This is a polynomial of degree ( leq n ), which by the induction hypothesis is unbounded.

This is possible because there exists a prime between ( y ) and ( 2y ) (by Bertrand's postulate).    - By Dirichlet's theorem, we can take ( p_infty equiv -k pmod{q} ).    - Let ( S = text{lcm}(p_infty + 1, p_infty + 2, ldots, p_infty + k - 1) ).    - Then,      [      f(p_infty - 1) = text{lcm}(p_infty, p_infty + 1, ldots, p_infty + k - 1) = text{lcm}(p_infty, S) = frac{Sp_infty}{gcd(p_infty, S)} = Sp_infty      ]    - Since ( q mid (p_infty + k) ) and ( q mid S ), we have ( gcd(p_infty + k, S) geq q ).    - Thus,      [      f(p_infty) = text{lcm}(p_infty + 1, p_infty + 2, ldots, p_infty + k) = text{lcm}(p_infty + k, S) = frac{(p_infty + k)S}{gcd(p_infty + k, S)} leq frac{(p_infty + k)S}{q}      ]    - Given ( f(p_infty - 1) < f(p_infty) ), we get:      [      Sp_infty < frac{(p_infty + k)S}{q} implies p_infty(q - 1) < k      ]    - This is a contradiction for sufficiently large ( p_infty ). 5. **Case Analysis for ( k leq 2 ):**    - For ( k = 1 ), ( text{lcm}(n+1) = n+1 ), so ( f(n) = n+1 ).    - For ( k = 2 ), ( text{lcm}(n+1, n+2) = frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{gcd(n+1, n+2)} = (n+1)(n+2) = n^2 + 3n + 2 ), so ( f(n) = n^2 + 3n + 2 ).

This means:    [    f(n) mod f(k) = 0    ] 3. **Analyzing Specific Cases**:    - First, let's consider the case when ( k = 1 ):      [      f(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3      ]      Thus, for all ( n ), ( 3 ) must divide ( f(n) ).

How did the seventh group member figure out the number?","output":"1. **Determine the Validity of Statements V and VI:**    - If Statement VI is true (i.e., b is an integer divisible by 14), then it implies b is also a rational number, because all integers are rational numbers. Hence, both statements V and VI would be true, which contradicts the condition that only one of them can be true.    - Therefore, Statement VI must be false, and Statement V is true:       [      text{b is a rational number.}      ] 2. **Determine the Validity of Statements III and IV:**    - Since b is rational (from Step 1), Statement III cannot be true because there is no rational number whose square is 13. Specifically:      - Assume b = frac{p}{q} is in its simplest form.      - If left(frac{p}{q}right)^{2} = 13, then:        [        p^2 = 13q^2        ]      - This implies p^2 is divisible by 13, and hence, p is divisible by 13. Let p = 13r, then:        [        (13r)^2 = 13q^2 implies 169r^2 = 13q^2 implies q^2 = 13r^2        ]      - This shows q is also divisible by 13, which contradicts the assumption that frac{p}{q} is in its simplest form. Therefore, no rational solutions exist.    - So, Statement III is false, and Statement IV is true:      [      text{b is an integer divisible by 7.}      ] 3. **Determine the Validity of Statements I and II:**    - Statement IV tells us that b is divisible by 7 and an integer.    - If Statement I (b is even) were true, b would be a multiple of 14. However, this contradicts the falsity of Statement VI (as b cannot be divisible by 14).    - Therefore, Statement I must be false and Statement II is true:      [      text{Adding the cube of b to b gives a positive number less than 8000.}      ] 4. **Find the Correct Value of b:**    - From Statement II being true, we have:      [      b + b^3 < 8000      ]    - Knowing b is odd (since b is not even and divisible by 7) and a positive integer (since b + b^3 is positive):      [      text{Check possible values of } b text{ that are less than } 20 text{ (since } b + b^3< 8000 text{ and } 20 + 20^3 > 8000 text{)}.      ]      - Trying b = 7:        [        b^3 = 7^3 = 343, quad b + b^3 = 7 + 343 = 350        ]      - 350 is indeed less than 8000, and 7 meets all required conditions: it is a positive odd number less than 20, divisible by 7, and not divisible by 14.        **Conclusion:** The correct number b is:    [    boxed{7}    ]"},{"instruction":"Let mathbf{a}, mathbf{b}, mathbf{c} be vectors such that |mathbf{a}| = 2, |mathbf{b}| = 2, |mathbf{c}| = 3, and [mathbf{a} times (mathbf{a} times mathbf{c}) + mathbf{b} = mathbf{k},] where mathbf{k} = begin{pmatrix} 2  1  0 end{pmatrix}.

It is observed that five of the sums are positive and five of the sums are negative. We want to determine how many of the products are positive and how many are negative.  Step-by-Step Explanation: 1. **Identify the Condition**:     - We know there are 5 sums that are positive and 5 sums that are negative.      - Given the presence of both positive and negative sums, it implies that there must be a mix of positive and negative numbers. 2. **Reason about the Number Composition**:     - If all five numbers were of the same sign, all pairs would have the same type of sums, either all positive or all negative. Therefore, we must have both positive and negative numbers represented.      - Since there are more than three pairs, a scenario with four numbers of one sign and one of the other would yield six sums of the majority sign (total pairs ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) plus four pairs involving the fifth number), violating the given conditions of five sums each being positive and negative.  3. **Dividing into Groups**:     - Thus, the numbers must be divided into a group of three with one sign and a group of two with the other sign.  4. **Number of Positive and Negative Products**:     - Products are positive if both factors have the same sign.     - Products are negative if both factors have different signs.     - Let's designate three numbers as positive ((a, b, c > 0)) and two numbers as negative ((d, e < 0)). 5. **Product Calculation**:     - Positive products: There will be (binom{3}{2}) products among the positives and no products among the negatives.         [         binom{3}{2} = 3         ]     - Negative products: Products of a positive number and a negative number:         [         binom{3}{1} times binom{2}{1} = 3 times 2 = 6         ]     - Additionally, products among the negative would also be positive:         [         binom{2}{2} = 1         ]     Combining them together:     - Total positive products (= 3 + 1 = 4)     - Total negative products (= 6) # Conclusion: The total number of positive products is (4) and the total number of negative products is (6).

Each coin is either heads-up or tails-up. The assistant covers all but one coin with cups. The magician then enters and reveals another covered coin that matches the side (heads or tails) of the initially uncovered coin. 2. **Key Observation**:     The total number of coins (11) is odd. This means there will inevitably be at least one pair of adjacent coins that show the same face (both heads or both tails). This uses the fact that in a circular arrangement with an odd number of positions, you cannot alternate between heads and tails without repetition. 3. **Assistant's Action Plan**:    - The assistant looks for any two adjacent coins that show the same face.    - Let’s denote these two adjacent coins as ( C_i ) and ( C_{i+1} ).    - The assistant leaves ( C_i ) uncovered (this can be either ( C_i ) or ( C_{i+1} )), and covers all other coins with cups. 4. **Magician's Strategy**:    - The magician observes the single uncovered coin, ( C_i ), and notes its face (either heads or tails).    - Knowing that there is at least one more coin (( C_{i+1} )) immediately next to ( C_i ) with the same face, the magician points to ( C_{i+1} ) when prompted by the audience.     5. **Confirmation**:    - Since ( C_i ) and ( C_{i+1} ) were noted by the assistant as having the same face, the magician’s revealed coin will match the face of the initially uncovered coin.

So, he spent ( frac{1}{3} times (1 - f) times 2.25 ) dollars at the toy store. After spending at the toy store, he had ( (1 - f) times 2.25 - frac{1}{3} times (1 - f) times 2.25 ) dollars left. Finally, he spent his last 0.60 at the candy store. This means that the amount he had left after the toy store was 0.60. So we have the equation: [ (1 - f) times 2.25 - frac{1}{3} times (1 - f) times 2.25 = 0.60 ] Let's solve for ( f ): [ (1 - f) times 2.25 - frac{1}{3} times (1 - f) times 2.25 = 0.60 ] [ (1 - f) times 2.25 times left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) = 0.60 ] [ (1 - f) times 2.25 times frac{2}{3} = 0.60 ] [ (1 - f) times 1.50 = 0.60 ] [ 1 - f = frac{0.60}{1.50} ] [ 1 - f = frac{2}{5} ] [ f = 1 - frac{2}{5} ] [ f = frac{5}{5} - frac{2}{5} ] [ f = frac{3}{5} ] So, John spent ( boxed{frac{3}{5}}  ) of his allowance at the arcade."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Unlike Finite Element Method (FEM) which follows the continuum approach, Discrete Element Method (DEM) was developed roughly 40 years ago attempted to model the nature behavior of particulate discontinuous media. Various studies have tried to simulate the mechanical soil behaviors under different controlled conditions by calibrating the DEM input micro-parameters. The calibration process plays essential role in reproducing the meso-mechanical response of granular materials subjected to laboratory tests. The goal of this study is to develop a methodology to calibrate the DEM input micro-parameters to accurate reproduce the meso-mechanical behaviors of granular materials subjected to controlled test conditions then apply to the in-situ conditions. This research consists of four studies. The first study investigates the effect of sample preparation conditions on material response using air pluviation method to prepare the sample. The DEM model is created to verify its ability to resemble the heterogeneity of the prepared granular sample via air pluviation. The second study presents a simple DEM model to replicate the triaxial compression test result for mono size steel spheres. The third study proposes a calibration process on model micro-parameters subjected to a compression test incorporating flexible membrane in the DEM model. The fourth study tries to apply DEM for solving large displacement problem like asteroid impact at Chicxulub.","output":"This thesis focuses on the simulation of soil behaviors using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and aims to develop a methodology to accurately reproduce the meso-mechanical behaviors of granular materials under controlled test conditions and in-situ conditions.

The plots of void ratio variation of samples prepared by air pluvitation and radius expansion methods are compared with the global experimental void ratio. The DEM model replicating the air pluviation method yields more accurate void ratio. In the second study, a 2D DEM model of triaxial test with flexible membrane is created capturing the slope and peak stress behavior of the material. However, the model has greater softening effect comparing to the experimental result due to the difference between 2D model and 3D experimental result. It is noticed that there are significant fluctuation in the model stress-strain curve due to the crystalline effect of using mono size particles in the model. The material elastic modulus needs to be reduced significantly to 1e8 Pa in order to match with the experimental response. The local deformation and formation of shear band can be observed in the model. The calibration of model micro parameters using probabilistic framework is established in the third study to replicate the behavior of sand under triaxial compression. Initial sensitivity analysis confirms that the 2D model response can capture the sample modulus of elasticity and the peak stress. Softening effect is still experienced in the model behavior. The fourth study produces a numerical assessment for the effects of asteroid impact at various impact conditions (impact angle and impact velocity). The resulted craters have complex craters aspects similarly to the Chicxulub crater. The topographies of simulated craters are then compared with the actual crater topography obtained from site investigation and show similar trend for simulations of 90 0 impact angle. Velocity fields are presented at the moments right after the impact blast to capture the transmission in impact shockwave through the bedrock. Horizontal and vertical stresses are also recorded throughout the impact duration along the vertical centerline of the simulated field. It is observed that the greatest stresses experienced at the depth of 40 km below the surface level. The magnitude of the maximum stresses is within 30 GPa which seems reasonable when comparing with other previous numerical simulations since the simulations only represent mechanical response to the impact. The distribution of the impact bedrock debris is more visible on the same side with the asteroid location (uprange direction). This finding contradicts with the previous numerical study by G. Collins and needs to be further investigated.","output":"The conclusion of the thesis highlights the preliminary results of the four studies conducted.

Here's an example of what a Shortstack race and its subraces could look like, using the standard PHB races as guidelines for game balance. **Shortstack Racial Traits** - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 2. Shortstacks are hardy due to their unique build and surprising resilience. - **Age:** Shortstacks reach adulthood at the same rate humans do and live into their second century. - **Alignment:** Most Shortstacks lean towards good alignments, having tight-knit communities, but their personalities and morals are as varied as any other race. - **Size:** Shortstacks stand around 3 to 4 feet tall and have robust, wide frames. Your size is Small. - **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 25 feet due to your short legs. - **Sturdy Frame:** Despite your size, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. - **Low Center of Gravity:** You have advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone. - **Distinct Physique:** You gain proficiency in one of the following skills due to your build: Athletics, Acrobatics, or Performance. - **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Subraces can add flavor and represent different cultures or genetic traits within the Shortstack race. **Subrace: Femina** - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma score increases by 1. The Femina's impressive presence makes them naturally charming. - **Bountiful Presence:** Once per long rest, you may use your action to captivate those around you. Any creature within 10 feet that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. - **Voluptuous Advantage:** You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill. **Subrace: Masculinus** - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 1. The Masculinus's stout legs and lower body strength give them a solid foundation. - **Leg Power:** You can jump twice as far as a normal creature of your size. - **Unyielding Posture:** You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would move you against your will or alter your position (such as the shove action or spells like Thunderwave). When developing homebrew content, remember to playtest with your group and be willing to make adjustments for balance and fun. The above is a rough guideline and can be changed to better fit the specific themes and needs of your campaign setting.

Si aucune des conditions \\"if\\" ni \\"elif\\" n'est évaluée à True, le code à l'intérieur du bloc \\"else\\" (s'il y a un bloc \\"else\\") sera exécuté. La structure générale est donc : \`\`\` if condition1: # code à exécuter si condition1 est True elif condition2: # code à exécuter si condition2 est True elif condition3: # code à exécuter si condition3 est True ... else: # code à exécuter si aucune des conditions précédentes n'est True \`\`\` Il est important de noter que seuls les blocs \\"if\\" et \\"else\\" sont obligatoires, mais on peut avoir autant de blocs \\"elif\\" que nécessaire. Cela permet de gérer plusieurs conditions et d'exécuter le code approprié en fonction du résultat de ces conditions."},{"instruction":"Насколько часто встречаются дипломаты, которые являются полиглотами? Редкое ли это явление или нет? Под полиглотом я имею ввиду человека, который знает как минимум 3 языка","output":"Дипломаты, которые являются полиглотами, довольно распространены. Это связано с тем, что дипломатическая работа часто требует общения с представителями различных культур и стран. Знание нескольких языков позволяет дипломатам лучше понимать и общаться с иностранными коллегами, а также эффективнее представлять интересы своей страны. Официальный статус полиглота определенного количества знаний языков не существует. Однако большинство дипломатов имеют хорошие языковые навыки. Во многих странах знание двух или трех иностранных языков является обязательным условием для поступления на работу в дипломатический корпус.

Jemima Wanjiku fredonne, elle aussi, quelques notes en enfilant ses gants. Sécateur en main, elle par- court les longues allées de rosiers à la recherche des boutons presque éclos, coupe les tiges et les rassemble sans même interrompre sa marche Immédiatement après leur récolte, les fleurs sont transportées dans l'atelier attenant. Là, l'effervescence règne. Des cen- taines de petites mains saisissent, sectionnent, effeuil- lent, ajustent et rassemblent les tiges en bouquets. Le temps est compté. Ces roses, cultivées par la ferme horticole Wildfire sur le lac Naivasha, à une centaine de kilomètres au nord de Nairobi, au Kenya, doivent arri- ver le lendemain sur les étals français, anglais ou néer- landais pour la Saint-Valentin <<< Les ouvrières ont trente minutes entre la récolte et la mise en chambre froide, à 4°C. Après, les fleurs ris- quent de s'ouvrir. Or les consommateurs veulent qu'elles tiennent au moins sept jours dans leur vase », explique Peter Szapary, le propriétaire autrichien de la ferme, venu s'installer au Kenya en 1997 comme d'autres horticulteurs européens, rejoints aujourd'hui par des firmes transnationales, essentiellement in- diennes. Entre 70 000 et 80 000 roses, d'une palette allant du rouge au jaune, sortent tous les jours de ses entrepôts. Direction l'Europe, à 7 000 kilomètres de là, mais aussi les Etats-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. Peter Szapary a choisi de ne pas augmenter sa production pour la fête des amoureux. <« J'ai des accords de vente à l'année avec des supermarchés », justifie-t-il. En effet, les groupes de grande distribution (Carrefour, Tesco...) si- gnent des accords de vente annuels pour sécuriser leur approvisionnement. Dans le même temps, les produc- teurs dépendent de plus en plus de ces contrats, qui dictent à l'avance les prix et la quantité de fleurs à pro- duire. Controverse Depuis une vingtaine d'années, le Kenya s'est fait con- naître pour sa production de fleurs: il a remplacé l'Eu- rope (Pays-Bas, France...) comme un des principaux producteurs mondiaux. Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac. Les centaines de mil- liers de personnes qui vivent sur ses rives y contri buent, notamment par les rejets d'effluents des bidon- villes. Conséquence: des algues invasives proliferent en présence des nutriments, au grand dam des 400 pê- cheurs du lac qui peinent chaque jour davantage à ma- nœuvrer leurs embarcations. d'après Audrey Garric, « Au Kenya, les épineuses roses de la Saint-Valentin », Le Monde, 10 février 2015. Grâce à ce texte répond au question entre guillemets \\"Type d'acteurs qui interviennent dans la mise en relation des espaces (carac- téristiques et locali- sation) Propriétaires des roseraies,Main d'œuvre ou- vriers, médias, pêcheurs,État(s), gouverne- ment(s),ONG (organisations non-gouvernemen- tales),Consommateurs,Groupes de grande distribution","output":"Les propriétaires des roseraies, comme Peter Szapary, agissent principalement sur plusieurs espaces. Premièrement, ils agissent au niveau local dans la gestion et l'exploitation des fermes horticoles situées près du lac Naivasha, au Kenya. Ces acteurs sont responsables de l'ensemble des processus de production, de la coupe des roses à leur préparation pour l'expédition. Deuxièmement, ils interagissent aussi à l'échelle internationale, car leurs produits sont exportés vers de nombreux pays tels que la France, l'Angleterre, les Pays-Bas, mais aussi vers d'autres marchés éloignés comme les États-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. Par leur action, les propriétaires des roseraies influencent directement la mise en relation des espaces mentionnés ci-dessus : 1. **Propriétaires des roseraies** : Situés au Kenya, ils gèrent les exploitations horticoles et prennent les décisions opérationnelles et stratégiques, notamment concernant la production et la distribution. 2. **Main d'œuvre ouvriers** : Les travailleurs sont originaires du Kenya et d'autres régions, attirés par les offres d'emploi dans les fermes floricoles. Ils interviennent dans le processus de production, depuis la récolte jusqu'au conditionnement des roses pour l'exportation. 3. **Médias** : Ils jouent un rôle de surveillance et de reportage, souvent étrangers ou locaux non accueillis dans les fermes. Ils participent à la sensibilisation des consommateurs et à la mise en lumière des pratiques dans les roseraies. 4. **Pêcheurs** : Locaux, ils subissent les conséquences environnementales de l'exploitation horticole sur leur écosystème, notamment sur le lac Naivasha. 5. **État(s), gouvernement(s)** : Le gouvernement kenyan intervient dans la régulation et la modernisation du secteur, comme avec la modernisation de l'aéroport de Nairobi et la mise en place d'un plan de gestion de l'eau. 6. **ONG (organisations non-gouvernementales)** : Elles peuvent être locales ou internationales, et elles agissent dans le contrôle et la critique des pratiques sociales et environnementales de l'industrie de la floriculture au Kenya. 7. **Consommateurs** : Situés principalement en Europe, mais aussi dans d'autres parties du monde, ils sont l'objet final de la chaîne de distribution des roses. Leurs attentes et leurs choix de consommation influencent les pratiques de production et de commercialisation. 8. **Groupes de grande distribution** : Ces groupes, comme Carrefour ou Tesco, situés principalement en Europe, signent des contrats annuels et dictent les conditions de vente, influençant ainsi la production et la stratégie commerciale des propriétaires des roseraies. Les propriétaires des roseraies sont donc des acteurs clés qui interconnectent des espaces locaux de production avec des espaces de consommation mondiaux, tout en étant influencés par une multitude d'autres acteurs sociaux, économiques et environnementaux."},{"instruction":"Hi!

To create a business rule to track the total count of incidents raised by a logged-in user, you will need to have the appropriate access rights to create and modify business rules. Below is a high-level description of how you would set up such a business rule. Note that this is just an example, and there may be variations or additional considerations depending on your specific ServiceNow instance and its configuration. 1. Navigate to System Definition > Business Rules in your ServiceNow instance. 2. Click on the \\"New\\" button to create a new business rule. 3. Give the business rule a descriptive Name (e.g., \\"Count User Incidents\\"). 4. In the Table field, select \\"Incident\\" (or the name of your incident table, which is usually \\"incident\\"). 5. In the \\"When to run\\" tab, you will need to set the conditions for running this rule. Depending on your requirement, you likely want the rule to run: - Before the record is inserted (If you simply want to count incidents as they are created) - On the \\"insert\\" operation specifically, so select the \\"insert\\" checkbox 6. In the \\"Advanced\\" tab, check the \\"Advanced\\" checkbox to be able to write a script. 7. In the \\"Script\\" field, enter the JavaScript code for your business rule. Here's an example of what the code might look like: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Get the sys_id of the current logged-in user var userID = gs.getUserID(); // Query the Incident table to get the count of incidents created by the logged-in user var incGr = new GlideRecord('incident'); incGr.addQuery('caller_id', userID); incGr.query(); // Variable to hold the count of incidents var incidentCount = 0; // Loop through the results and count the incidents while (incGr.next()) { incidentCount++; } // Log the count or take additional action as needed gs.info('Total Incidents raised by user ' + gs.getUserName() + ': ' + incidentCount); // Optionally, set a user preference or some other record field with the count // current.setValue('u_incident_count', incidentCount); })(current, previous); \`\`\` 8. Click \\"Submit\\" to save the business rule. Remember that the script above is a simple example and may need to be adapted for your specific requirements, such as where to store the count and whether to display the count to the user or perform additional actions based on the count. Also, be aware that counting incidents each time a new incident is created may not be the most efficient approach, especially if the count is simply for display purposes; in such cases, consider using an aggregation function or maintaining a count through a separate process or scheduled job."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As their name implies, shortstacks are short, akin to halflings, and stacked, a typical member sporting assets far larger than even voluptuous humans, making them look even huger on their diminutive bodies.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - DAY Background: In the previous scene, ELENA, a young, Mexican American woman in her mid-twenties with her hair tied in a casual bun, wearing a colorful embroidered blouse and comfortable khaki capris, made an urgent exit from a particularly lengthy work meeting which had overrun. She had ignored several signals from her body, suppressing the growing urge to move her bowels in hopes of making it home in time. In her hastened departure, she had neglected to visit the restroom—a decision she now regrets as she scurries toward her family's apartment with clenched cheeks and a gait that signifies her discomfort. EXT. FAMILY'S APARTMENT DOOR - DAY ELENA, out of breath and sweating slightly from the strain of holding back nature's call, reaches the apartment door. She frantically pats down her pockets, her movements increasingly frantic, and realization dawns—she's misplaced her house key. ELENA (shouting) ¡Ay no, no puede ser! She begins KNOCKING fiercely on the door. INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS From inside, we hear the clamor. MARIA, Elena's mother, a stout woman in her fifties with silver-streaked hair and a colorful apron splattered with flour, makes her way to the door. MARIA (calling out) ¿Quién es? ¡Ya voy! EXT. FAMILY'S APARTMENT DOOR By now, Elena is hopping from one foot to the other, a dance of agony played out on her pained expression. ELENA (pleading through the door) ¡Mamá, abre rápido, por favor! INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Maria, struggling with the locks, finally starts opening the door. She's confused by Elena's panic. EXT. FAMILY'S APARTMENT DOOR With the door now slightly ajar, Elena tries to bolt past her mother. ELENA ¡Muevete, mamá, por favor! Maria instinctively grabs Elena's arm, concerned. MARIA (concerned) Mija, ¿qué te pasa? Dime. ELENA (desperate) ¡Déjame entrar, por favor! Their bicker continues as they tangle, Maria inadvertently blocking Elena's path. INT. FAMILY APARTMENT FOYER - CONTINUOUS Suddenly, Elena can't hold it any longer. She lets out a GROAN, her face contorting in shock and untimely relief. MARIA (perplexed) Elena, ¿qué tienes? Elena gently breaks her mother's grip and plants her feet, assuring her stance as she continues to involuntarily relieves herself in her pants, now GRUNTING with exertion and relief. Elena whispers through her relief, a muffled grunt accompanying her words. ELENA (whispering) Ay, qué alivio, pero qué pena... Maria, still trying to understand, is puzzled and frowns as she senses something is amiss. MARIA (confused) Hija, ¿estás...? Suddenly, Maria's nose WRINKLES as she notices the odor. Elena stands with a sheepish expression. Maria's realization is painted on her face. MARIA (disgusted) ¿Hiciste lo que creo que hiciste? Elena's silence is mortifying. Maria asks more directly, REACTING to the smell. MARIA (disgusted) Elena, ¿te hiciste en los pantalones? ELENA (deflecting) Nomas déjame pasar, mamá. Maria steps aside, waving her hand in disgust. ELENA (waddling) Lo siento, mamá. Maria stops Elena just a few steps inside, authoritatively. MARIA (scolding) ¡Espera ahí! No quiero que tires eso en el suelo. Elena reacts with an embarrassed grimace. MARIA (taunting) ¿No puedes ser más limpia? ¿Cuándo vas a madurar? Elena responds playfully but with a hint of blame. ELENA (playful) ¡Es tu culpa por tardarte tanto y no dejarme pasar! Maria rejects this, scolding further. MARIA (indignant) ¡Ninguna excusa es válida! ¡No seas niña! Elena insistently defends her predicament. ELENA (desperate) ¡Tenía que sacar todo! ¡Era demasiado urgente! She apprehensively TOUCHES the bulge in her pants, a wry smile mixing with discomfort. ELENA (wryly) Aunque no lo creas, sí se sintió... mejor... Ahora déjame ir al baño. Maria blocks Elena, feigning indignation at her last comment. MARIA (mocking) ¡Qué asco! Disfrutas de algo tan sucio. Maria insists on examining Elena's soiled pants. After a small struggle, she turns Elena around, expressing SCORN. MARIA (incredulous) ¡Mira nada más! Con razón te sentías bien. Elena bickers back coyly, touching her bulging pants. ELENA (coyly) Tenía mucho que sacar. Necesitaba alivio. Maria, scoffing, leans in closely, sniffs the bulge in Elena's pants with mock scrutiny. MARIA (mocking) ¡Apestas como niña! Así que te trataré como una. Elena cringes as Maria continues the infantile mockery. ELENA (resigned) Si quieres que me quede aquí apestosa, está bien. Maria waves off the comment, GUIDING her to the bathroom. MARIA (scolding) Vamos al baño, ya no aguanto el olor. They make their way, with Maria continuing to REACT to the odor and Elena cringing awkwardly. ELENA (bashful) Siento que se va a caer... They stop at the bathroom door. Elena teases Maria before entering. ELENA (coyly) ¿Quieres cambiarme el 'pañal'? Maria, at her wit's end, GRABS the bulge and PUSHES her into the bathroom, squashing it deliberately. MARIA (forceful) ¡Métete en el baño ya, qué cochina! Elena YELPS with disgust while Maria lets go, closing the door behind her. MARIA (to herself) ¡Increíble que una adulta haga estas cosas! Maria walks away still complaining as Elena is left alone, to clean up the mess she's made.

The deep reddish-brown color, like the eaves of the small town under the setting sun, and the clear amber, like the faint light in the alley at dusk. Like a cup of Pu'er tea, it emits a unique texture and structure. The water in the fire pit is gently bubbling, and the water droplets are lively and agile, deconstructing the color, fragrance, charm, and appearance of tea and tea people. The tea leaves unfold, like the alleys of the small town, winding and peaceful. When the texture of the tea slips through the fingertips, it outlines the traces of the years, as if time is frozen in a quiet flow, and every moment is immersed in the charm of a slow life. The people here are not oppressed by the busy pace of the city. They understand how to appreciate the overlooked beauty of life. A detailed description of the prompt above: The scene is set in a warm small town surrounded by picturesque mountains. The small town is characterized by traditional architecture with red-brick walls and curved roofs. The streets are lined with ancient stone pavements and delicate lanterns. There are small tea houses scattered throughout the town, emitting a subtle fragrance of tea. The tea houses are adorned with wooden furniture and hand-painted murals depicting the stories of tea. There are also local shops selling pottery, calligraphy brushes, and other traditional crafts. The ambiance is peaceful and serene, with the sound of camel bells echoing through the air. The streets are filled with locals and tourists, leisurely enjoying their cups of Pu'er tea and engaging in conversations. The atmosphere is vibrant and harmonious, creating a sense of community and celebration of tea culture. The compositions of the scene are carefully crafted to highlight the essence of tea and the beauty of the small town. The focal point of the composition is a tea table set against the backdrop of the small town's architecture. The table is adorned with delicate tea cups, tea leaves, and a teapot. The composition is balanced, with the tea table placed slightly off-center to create a sense of movement and depth. The surrounding elements, such as the street vendors, passersby, and blooming flowers, add layers of visual interest and storytelling to the scene. The use of leading lines and framing techniques guides the viewer's gaze towards the main subject, emphasizing the importance of tea in this small town. The mood, feelings, and atmosphere of the scene are tranquil, nostalgic, and full of appreciation for life's simple pleasures. The warm golden light of the setting sun bathes the small town, casting a soft glow on the buildings and streets. The air is filled with the aroma of tea and the sound of laughter. The people in the scene exude a sense of contentment and fulfillment, cherishing the beauty of nature, community, and the art of tea. The atmosphere is one of calmness and appreciation, inviting the viewer to slow down, immerse themselves in the scene, and savor the moment. In a photographic style reminiscent of Henri Cartier-Bresson's candid street photography, the scene is captured with a Leica M10 camera, using a 35mm lens. The composition is carefully framed to capture the essence of the small town and the tea culture. The use of shallow depth of field creates a sense of intimacy and focus on the tea table and its details. The color palette is rich and warm, with muted earth tones and pops of vibrant red and amber. The photograph has a timeless quality, evoking a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for traditional culture. --ar 9:16 --v 5."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

Heute möchte ich mit Ihnen über das Thema Gewicht und Masse sprechen. Gewicht und Masse sind zwei wichtige Konzepte in der Physik, die oft verwechselt werden. Es ist jedoch wichtig, den Unterschied zwischen ihnen zu verstehen. Masse ist eine physikalische Größe, die angibt, wie viel Materie ein Objekt enthält. Sie wird in Kilogramm gemessen und ist eine grundlegende Eigenschaft eines Körpers. Die Masse bleibt unverändert, unabhängig vom Ort oder der Schwerkraft, in der sich das Objekt befindet. Auf der anderen Seite ist das Gewicht die Kraft, die auf einen Körper durch die Schwerkraft wirkt. Es ist die Wirkung der Schwerkraft auf die Masse. Das Gewicht wird in Newton gemessen und ändert sich je nach Ort in Bezug auf die Schwerkraft. Zum Beispiel haben wir auf der Erde ein bestimmtes Gewicht, aber auf dem Mond wäre es anders, da die Schwerkraft geringer ist. Um den Unterschied zwischen Gewicht und Masse zu verdeutlichen, können wir folgendes Beispiel betrachten: Wenn wir ein Kilogramm Feder und ein Kilogramm Eisen haben, haben beide die gleiche Masse. Ihr Gewicht ist jedoch unterschiedlich, da die Schwerkraft auf jeden Gegenstand unterschiedlich wirkt. Es gibt eine wichtige Formel, die den Zusammenhang zwischen Gewicht, Masse und Schwerkraft herstellt: F = m * g, wobei F die Kraft (Gewicht) in Newton, m die Masse in Kilogramm und g die Erdbeschleunigung in Metern pro Sekunde zum Quadrat ist. Es ist auch wichtig anzumerken, dass Gewicht und Masse eng miteinander verbunden sind, aber in verschiedenen Kontexten verwendet werden. Im Alltag sprechen wir oft über Gewicht, während Masse ein Begriff ist, der in wissenschaftlichen Bereichen verwendet wird. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass Gewicht und Masse zwei unterschiedliche physikalische Größen sind. Masse ist eine grundlegende Eigenschaft eines Körpers und bleibt unverändert, während das Gewicht die Wirkung der Schwerkraft auf die Masse ist und sich je nach Ort ändert. Vielen Dank für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit! Haben Sie noch Fragen zu diesem Thema?"},{"instruction":"Il est 8 heures et on entend les oiseaux chanter dans la serre. Jemima Wanjiku fredonne, elle aussi, quelques notes en enfilant ses gants. Sécateur en main, elle par- court les longues allées de rosiers à la recherche des boutons presque éclos, coupe les tiges et les rassemble sans même interrompre sa marche Immédiatement après leur récolte, les fleurs sont transportées dans l'atelier attenant. Là, l'effervescence règne. Des cen- taines de petites mains saisissent, sectionnent, effeuil- lent, ajustent et rassemblent les tiges en bouquets. Le temps est compté. Ces roses, cultivées par la ferme horticole Wildfire sur le lac Naivasha, à une centaine de kilomètres au nord de Nairobi, au Kenya, doivent arri- ver le lendemain sur les étals français, anglais ou néer- landais pour la Saint-Valentin <<< Les ouvrières ont trente minutes entre la récolte et la mise en chambre froide, à 4°C. Après, les fleurs ris- quent de s'ouvrir. Or les consommateurs veulent qu'elles tiennent au moins sept jours dans leur vase », explique Peter Szapary, le propriétaire autrichien de la ferme, venu s'installer au Kenya en 1997 comme d'autres horticulteurs européens, rejoints aujourd'hui par des firmes transnationales, essentiellement in- diennes. Entre 70 000 et 80 000 roses, d'une palette allant du rouge au jaune, sortent tous les jours de ses entrepôts. Direction l'Europe, à 7 000 kilomètres de là, mais aussi les Etats-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. Peter Szapary a choisi de ne pas augmenter sa production pour la fête des amoureux. <« J'ai des accords de vente à l'année avec des supermarchés », justifie-t-il. En effet, les groupes de grande distribution (Carrefour, Tesco...) si- gnent des accords de vente annuels pour sécuriser leur approvisionnement. Dans le même temps, les produc- teurs dépendent de plus en plus de ces contrats, qui dictent à l'avance les prix et la quantité de fleurs à pro- duire. Controverse Depuis une vingtaine d'années, le Kenya s'est fait con- naître pour sa production de fleurs: il a remplacé l'Eu- rope (Pays-Bas, France...) comme un des principaux producteurs mondiaux. Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac. Les centaines de mil- liers de personnes qui vivent sur ses rives y contri buent, notamment par les rejets d'effluents des bidon- villes.

Ces acteurs sont situés au Kenya mais ont des liens avec leur pays d'origine, comme l'Autriche, et d’autres pays où ils pourraient développer leur activité, comme l’Éthiopie. 2. **Main d'œuvre - Ouvriers :** Des travailleurs kényans, comme James Kihara Ndung'u, qui sont employés dans les fermes horticoles. Ils vivent souvent dans des bidonvilles à proximité des serres, comme Karagita, et peuvent venir de différentes régions du Kenya. 3. **Médias :** Les journalistes locaux et étrangers qui cherchent à rendre compte du secteur horticole au Kenya, mais se heurtent souvent à des restrictions d'accès. Ils peuvent être basés au Kenya ou venir de l’étranger. 4. **Pêcheurs :** Les habitants locaux qui vivent du lac Naivasha et qui sont affectés par l'activité des roseraies et la pollution qu'elle engendre. 5. **État, gouvernement :** Le gouvernement kenyan, qui régule le secteur, délivre des permis d’eau et modernise des infrastructures comme l'aéroport de Nairobi, est un acteur clé. C’est à la fois un acteur local et un représentant de l'État kényan. 6. **ONG (organisations non-gouvernementales) :** Des organisations nationales et internationales qui surveillent les impacts sociaux et environnementaux de l'industrie florale, telles que des associations riveraines du lac Naivasha. 7. **Consommateurs :** Les clients en Europe (France, Angleterre, Pays-Bas) ainsi qu'aux États-Unis, en Australie et au Japon, qui achètent les roses produites au Kenya pour des occasions comme la Saint-Valentin. Ils sont répartis dans le monde entier. 8. **Groupes de grande distribution :** Des sociétés comme Carrefour, Tesco, etc., qui signent des contrats annuels avec des fermes pour sécuriser leur approvisionnement en fleurs. Ces acteurs sont principalement situés dans les pays consommateurs, en Europe et ailleurs. Chaque groupe d'acteurs joue un rôle spécifique dans la chaîne de valeur de l'industrie florale, affectant les relations économiques et environnementales entre les pays producteurs et les pays consommateurs."},{"instruction":"una sbarra omogenea di lunghezza L è appoggiata ad un pavimento orizzontale sollevata da due vincoli posti agli estremi a e b, supponendo che il secondo si trovi ad una distanza l/4 dall'estremo B, calcolare le reazioni vincolari nei due punti dei vincoli.","output":"Per risolvere questo problema possiamo applicare le equazioni dell'equilibrio statico, in particolare l'equilibrio dei momenti e l'equilibrio delle forze verticali. Dato che abbiamo a che fare con una sbarra omogenea, il suo peso si distribuisce uniformemente lungo la sua lunghezza L. Indichiamo con W il peso totale della sbarra. Il baricentro (centro di massa) della sbarra si troverà al centro della sua lunghezza, quindi a una distanza L/2 da entrambi gli estremi. Indichiamo con R_a la reazione vincolare nel punto A e con R_b la reazione vincolare nel punto B. Per l'equilibrio dei momenti possiamo scrivere: ΣM_A = 0 (somma dei momenti rispetto al punto A pari a zero) Il momento generato dalla forza peso della sbarra rispetto al punto A sarà: M_W = W * (L/2) Ora, dato che il punto B si trova a una distanza L/4 dall’estremo B, la distanza dal punto A sarà 3L/4. Quindi, il momento generato dalla reazione vincolare R_b rispetto al punto A sarà: M_b = R_b * (3L/4) Applicando l'equilibrio dei momenti rispetto ad A abbiamo: R_b * (3L/4) = W * (L/2) Da cui: R_b = (2/3) * W Per l'equilibrio delle forze verticali, che ci dice che la somma di tutte le forze verticali deve essere zero, abbiamo: ΣF_y = 0 R_a + R_b = W Sostituendo R_b con (2/3) * W, otteniamo: R_a + (2/3) * W = W R_a = W - (2/3) * W = (1/3) * W Quindi, le reazioni vincolari saranno: R_a = (1/3) * W R_b = (2/3) * W Le reazioni nei punti dei vincoli A e B sono rispettivamente un terzo e due terzi del peso totale della sbarra."},{"instruction":"potresti scrivere una lettera a simone tosti dicendogli che è stao scelo per artecipare all'attivtà politica di Democrazia Sovrana e Popolare di Toscano Francesco e Marco rizzo , e che potrebbe particapre al primo congresso che si terrà il 27 Gennaio a Roma","output":"Certamente!

Entre 70 000 et 80 000 roses, d'une palette allant du rouge au jaune, sortent tous les jours de ses entrepôts. Direction l'Europe, à 7 000 kilomètres de là, mais aussi les Etats-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon.

Dans le même temps, les produc- teurs dépendent de plus en plus de ces contrats, qui dictent à l'avance les prix et la quantité de fleurs à pro- duire. Controverse Depuis une vingtaine d'années, le Kenya s'est fait con- naître pour sa production de fleurs: il a remplacé l'Eu- rope (Pays-Bas, France...) comme un des principaux producteurs mondiaux. Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac.

Cet espace est caractérisé par les serres et les ateliers de préparation des fleurs où les travailleurs cultivent, récoltent, préparent et emballent les produits destinés à l'exportation. Dans le texte, on apprend que cette main-d'œuvre agit sur un espace productif situé près du lac Naivasha au Kenya, où l'on trouve à la fois les champs de rosiers et les infrastructures pour le traitement post-récolte des fleurs (l'atelier attenant). L'ensemble de cette chaine de production est ensuite relié à un réseau logistique international qui achemine les roses vers divers marchés à travers le monde, notamment en Europe, aux États-Unis, en Australie et au Japon. Le texte mentionne l'importance des conditions climatiques favorables autour du lac Naivasha, qui rappellent l'été européen et permettent une floraison optimale des roses sans chauffage artificiel. En outre, le texte aborde les aspects sociaux et environnementaux de cette industrie florale, comme les salaires très bas des ouvriers, la concurrence internationale, et l'impact environnemental dû à l'utilisation intensive de l'eau et de produits chimiques. Il y a des références aux pressions internationales pour \\"verdir\\" le secteur, ainsi qu'aux conditions de travail et au coût humain et écologique de cette production au Kenya. L'espace de production non seulement fournit des emplois dans une région touchée par le chômage, mais pose également des défis considérables en termes de durabilité et de responsabilité sociale, mettant en lumière la complexité des réseaux de production globalisés et leurs implications locales."},{"instruction":"Пееформулируй Целью данной программы для субъектов образования является подготовка консультантов и специалистов по управлению персональным здоровьем людей молодого, зрелого и пожилого возраста, направленному на увеличение продолжительности и качества их предстоящей жизни, предупреждение возраст ассоциированных заболеваний и обострения этих заболеваний, предупреждение и коррекцию дефицита витаминов, минералов и биоактивных веществ, ассоциированного с возрастом.

Для удаления индекса вы можете использовать следующую команду: \`\`\`sql DROP INDEX schema.index_name; \`\`\` Где \`schema\` — это имя схемы, к которой принадлежит индекс, а \`index_name\` — имя индекса, который вы хотите удалить. Если индекс находится в вашей текущей схеме, то указание схемы не обязательно. Если вы получаете ошибку при попытке удалить индекс, убедитесь, что вы указали правильное полное имя индекса, включая схему, если это необходимо. Вы также можете проверить наличие индекса в вашей схеме (или во всей базе данных, если у вас достаточно прав), используя следующую команду: \`\`\`sql SELECT index_name, table_owner, table_name, status FROM all_indexes WHERE index_name = 'ИМЯ_ИНДЕКСА'; \`\`\` Если запись об индексе присутствует в ответе на этот запрос, то индекс существует, и вы должны быть в состоянии его удалить. Если записи нет, то индекс либо не существует, либо принадлежит другой схеме. Убедитесь также, что при запросе имя индекса указано в верхнем регистре, если только индекс не был создан с использованием кавычек и именем в другом регистре. Если проблема не устранена, возможно, вам потребуется дополнительно исследовать состояние вашей базы данных или обратиться за помощью к администратору базы данных."},{"instruction":"удаляет ли команда drop table в Sas индекс у таблицы в базе данных ORACLE?","output":"Когда вы используете SAS для взаимодействия с внешними базами данных, такими как Oracle, поведение SAS при выполнении операций, таких как \`DROP TABLE\`, может зависеть от различных факторов, включая способ подключения SAS к базе данных и настройки сессии. Обычно, если вы подключаетесь к базе данных Oracle через SAS и выполняете команду \`DROP TABLE\`, SAS отправляет соответствующую инструкцию SQL в базу данных Oracle для выполнения. Затем Oracle следует своим обычным правилам обработки таких инструкций. В Oracle, когда таблица удаляется через SQL-команду \`DROP TABLE\`, все ассоциированные с этой таблицей индексы также должны быть удалены. Однако, если SAS подключается к Oracle через ODBC или другие механизмы подключения, некоторые специфические для SAS инструкции или опции могут изменить стандартное поведение. Чтобы точно понять, что произойдет с индексами в Oracle при удалении таблицы из SAS, вам необходимо проверить следующее: 1. Каким методом SAS подключается к Oracle (например, через ODBC, JDBC, или непосредственно используя модуль SAS/ACCESS Interface to Oracle). 2. Конкретные настройки подключения и любые опции, которые могут влиять на то, как SAS отправляет команды в Oracle. 3. Версии и конфигурации Oracle и SAS, так как поведение может изменяться в различных версиях. Если после выполнения \`DROP TABLE\` из SAS индекс все же остается в базе данных Oracle, возможно, это связано с какой-то специфической опцией подключения или настройкой сессии, которая мешает передаче полной команды удаления в Oracle. В таком случае, для гарантированного удаления индекса, рекомендуется выполнить явное удаление индекса с помощью соответствующего SQL-запроса: \`\`\`sql DROP INDEX schema.index_name; \`\`\` Для решения данной проблемы вы можете также обратиться к документации SAS или проконсультироваться с администратором базы данных, который может иметь больше информации о конкретных настройках и поведении в вашей среде."},{"instruction":"верно ли прописан drop?

В Oracle, имя индекса (INDEX_NAME) и имя схемы (SCHEMA) указываются отдельно, и не должны включать имя таблицы. Команда для удаления индекса имеет следующий формат: \`\`\`sql DROP INDEX schema.index_name; \`\`\` Корректная команда для удаления индекса \`IDX_LOAN_CONTNUM\` из схемы \`acs\`, если этот индекс присутствует в базе данных и вы имеете соответствующие права, будет выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\`sql DROP INDEX acs.IDX_LOAN_CONTNUM; \`\`\` Вы упомянули \`BEH_CALC_BEH_DB\` вместе с индексом и схемой, что может вызывать путаницу. Если \`BEH_CALC_BEH_DB\` — это имя таблицы, оно не требуется в команде \`DROP INDEX\`. Однако, если \`BEH_CALC_BEH_DB\` является частью имени схемы (что нестандартно), то вам нужно будет скорректировать команду соответствующим образом, убедившись, что вы используете правильное имя схемы. Прежде чем выполнять команду удаления индекса, удостоверьтесь в том, что у вас есть права для выполнения этой операции и что работа с индексом не нарушит функционирование приложений или не приведет к потере производительности на запросы к соответствующей таблице."},{"instruction":"proc sql; DROP INDEX acs.IDX_LOAN_CONTNUM ; quit; ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the following: ',', FROM, ON.","output":"Причина ошибки в том, что вы используете синтаксис SQL внутри SAS, который несколько отличается от стандартного SQL для взаимодействия с базами данных, такими как Oracle. Когда вы подаете команду SQL из SAS, особенно если вы работаете через интерфейс SAS/ACCESS с внешней базой данных, следует использовать специфичный для SAS синтаксис. Например, если бы вы хотели удалить индекс в локальной SAS таблице, вы бы использовали синтаксис \`PROC DATASETS\`. К сожалению, команды \`DROP INDEX\` нет в \`PROC SQL\` в SAS. Для выполнения DDL команд напрямую в Oracle, вы должны использовать \`EXECUTE\` (или \`PASS-THROUGH\`) функционал в вашем SAS коде. Пример выполнения DDL операции в Oracle через SAS: \`\`\`sas proc sql; connect to oracle (user=oracle_user password=oracle_pass path=oracle_tns); execute(DROP INDEX acs.IDX_LOAN_CONTNUM) by oracle; disconnect from oracle; quit; \`\`\` Примечание: замените \`oracle_user\`, \`oracle_pass\`, и \`oracle_tns\` на реальные данные вашего подключения к базе данных Oracle.

Jemima Wanjiku fredonne, elle aussi, quelques notes en enfilant ses gants. Sécateur en main, elle par- court les longues allées de rosiers à la recherche des boutons presque éclos, coupe les tiges et les rassemble sans même interrompre sa marche Immédiatement après leur récolte, les fleurs sont transportées dans l'atelier attenant. Là, l'effervescence règne. Des cen- taines de petites mains saisissent, sectionnent, effeuil- lent, ajustent et rassemblent les tiges en bouquets. Le temps est compté. Ces roses, cultivées par la ferme horticole Wildfire sur le lac Naivasha, à une centaine de kilomètres au nord de Nairobi, au Kenya, doivent arri- ver le lendemain sur les étals français, anglais ou néer- landais pour la Saint-Valentin <<< Les ouvrières ont trente minutes entre la récolte et la mise en chambre froide, à 4°C. Après, les fleurs ris- quent de s'ouvrir. Or les consommateurs veulent qu'elles tiennent au moins sept jours dans leur vase », explique Peter Szapary, le propriétaire autrichien de la ferme, venu s'installer au Kenya en 1997 comme d'autres horticulteurs européens, rejoints aujourd'hui par des firmes transnationales, essentiellement in- diennes. Entre 70 000 et 80 000 roses, d'une palette allant du rouge au jaune, sortent tous les jours de ses entrepôts. Direction l'Europe, à 7 000 kilomètres de là, mais aussi les Etats-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. Peter Szapary a choisi de ne pas augmenter sa production pour la fête des amoureux. <« J'ai des accords de vente à l'année avec des supermarchés », justifie-t-il. En effet, les groupes de grande distribution (Carrefour, Tesco...) si- gnent des accords de vente annuels pour sécuriser leur approvisionnement. Dans le même temps, les produc- teurs dépendent de plus en plus de ces contrats, qui dictent à l'avance les prix et la quantité de fleurs à pro- duire. Controverse Depuis une vingtaine d'années, le Kenya s'est fait con- naître pour sa production de fleurs: il a remplacé l'Eu- rope (Pays-Bas, France...) comme un des principaux producteurs mondiaux. Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac. Les centaines de mil- liers de personnes qui vivent sur ses rives y contri buent, notamment par les rejets d'effluents des bidon- villes. Conséquence: des algues invasives proliferent en présence des nutriments, au grand dam des 400 pê- cheurs du lac qui peinent chaque jour davantage à ma- nœuvrer leurs embarcations. d'après Audrey Garric, « Au Kenya, les épineuses roses de la Saint-Valentin », Le Monde, 10 février 2015.","output":"Le texte décrit les activités de la ferme horticole Wildfire sur le lac Naivasha au Kenya, affectant principalement deux espaces: l'espace agricole (la production horticole des roses) et l'espace économique et social (les conditions de travail et l'impact environnemental). Deux actions principales sont abordées: la culture des roses et les pratiques commerciales associées. L'activité de la ferme impacte directement l'écosystème local à travers la consommation d'eau et l'utilisation de pesticides, ainsi que la qualité de vie des travailleurs, en offrant à la fois de l'emploi dans une région où le chômage est élevé mais en maintenant des salaires très faibles. Pour répondre à la question de savoir sur quel espace la ferme horticole « Wildfire » agit concrètement, nous pouvons identifier les domaines suivants : 1. L'espace agricole : a. Les serres et les allées de rosiers où les roses sont cultivées et récoltées. b. L'atelier attenant où les fleurs sont transformées en bouquets. 2. L'espace économique : a. Les relations commerciales avec des supermarchés internationaux pour la vente des roses. b. Le transport logistique vers l'Europe, les États-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. c. La stratégie de gestion de la production et des prix pour la Saint-Valentin et tout au long de l'année. 3. L'espace social : a. Les conditions de travail à la ferme horticole, comprenant des enjeux de salaires bas et de temps de travail. b. Les conséquences sociales dans les bidonvilles environnants où vivent beaucoup d'ouvriers. 4. L'espace environnemental : a. L'impact écologique sur le lac Naivasha due à l'irrigation des cultures par pompage de l'eau du lac. b. La contamination potentielle de l'eau par des pesticides et engrais. c. Les effets néfastes sur la pêche et la vie aquatique à cause des algues invasives et d'autres formes de pollution. En résumé, la ferme horticole agit sur l'espace agricole local (en cultivant des roses), l'espace économique international (en commercialisant des roses), l'espace social (en employant et affectant la qualité de vie des travailleurs locaux), et l'espace environnemental (en influençant l'écosystème du lac Naivasha)."},{"instruction":"Fass stichpunktartigg zusammen: Kompartimentierung durch Membranen Auch wenn die Beobachtung im tichtmikroskop dafüir spricht, dassProteine eingelagerte abgebaut Enzymewerden. auch direkt Zum anderen am Stoffwechselgeschehen sind Membranes ieb lebende Zellen von einer Membran umgrenzt sind, konnte erst da ligt.

Là, l'effervescence règne. Des cen- taines de petites mains saisissent, sectionnent, effeuil- lent, ajustent et rassemblent les tiges en bouquets. Le temps est compté.

Entre 70 000 et 80 000 roses, d'une palette allant du rouge au jaune, sortent tous les jours de ses entrepôts. Direction l'Europe, à 7 000 kilomètres de là, mais aussi les Etats-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. Peter Szapary a choisi de ne pas augmenter sa production pour la fête des amoureux. <« J'ai des accords de vente à l'année avec des supermarchés », justifie-t-il. En effet, les groupes de grande distribution (Carrefour, Tesco...) si- gnent des accords de vente annuels pour sécuriser leur approvisionnement. Dans le même temps, les produc- teurs dépendent de plus en plus de ces contrats, qui dictent à l'avance les prix et la quantité de fleurs à pro- duire. Controverse Depuis une vingtaine d'années, le Kenya s'est fait con- naître pour sa production de fleurs: il a remplacé l'Eu- rope (Pays-Bas, France...) comme un des principaux producteurs mondiaux. Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac. Les centaines de mil- liers de personnes qui vivent sur ses rives y contri buent, notamment par les rejets d'effluents des bidon- villes. Conséquence: des algues invasives proliferent en présence des nutriments, au grand dam des 400 pê- cheurs du lac qui peinent chaque jour davantage à ma- nœuvrer leurs embarcations. d'après Audrey Garric, « Au Kenya, les épineuses roses de la Saint-Valentin », Le Monde, 10 février 2015.","output":"D'après le texte, les pêcheurs agissent et exercent leur activité sur le lac Naivasha, situé à une centaine de kilomètres au nord de Nairobi, au Kenya. Toutefois, ils sont affectés par l'expansion de la floriculture — en particulier par la culture intensive de roses pour l'exportation — qui a des répercussions sur l'écosystème du lac. Les rejets d'engrais et de pesticides des fermes horticoles dans les eaux du lac contribuent à la prolifération d'algues invasives et à la contamination de l'eau, ce qui nuit aux conditions de pêche et à la qualité de vie des pêcheurs qui dépendent de cette ressource pour leur subsistance.

Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac. Les centaines de mil- liers de personnes qui vivent sur ses rives y contri buent, notamment par les rejets d'effluents des bidon- villes. Conséquence: des algues invasives proliferent en présence des nutriments, au grand dam des 400 pê- cheurs du lac qui peinent chaque jour davantage à ma- nœuvrer leurs embarcations. d'après Audrey Garric, « Au Kenya, les épineuses roses de la Saint-Valentin », Le Monde, 10 février 2015.","output":"À partir du texte fourni, le gouvernement et l'État peuvent agir sur divers espaces, notamment : 1. Le secteur agricole et horticole : En l'occurrence, le gouvernement kenyan a pris des mesures pour moderniser l'aéroport de Nairobi, facilitant ainsi le transport et l'exportation des fleurs, ce qui montre une action sur l'infrastructure et le secteur économique local. 2. L’environnement et la gestion des ressources naturelles : Le gouvernement kenyan intervient dans la gestion de l'eau en mettant en place un plan d'allocation pour rationner l'utilisation de l'eau du lac Naivasha, ce qui indique une action sur les ressources naturelles et la préservation de l'écosystème. 3. Le cadre législatif et réglementaire : Le gouvernement établit des lois qui encadrent l'utilisation des ressources (comme l'eau) et qui visent à contrôler l'emploi de pesticides et la contamination de l'eau. Ces actions montrent une influence sur les pratiques industrielles et la santé publique. 4. Le domaine social et économique : Le gouvernement établit les salaires minimaux et peut influencer les conditions de travail à travers la législation du travail. Dans le texte, il est fait mention du salaire minimal légal, cela reflète donc une intervention étatique sur les conditions socio-économiques des travailleurs. 5. Le domaine de la santé publique et du travail : En réponse aux controverses autour de l'exploitation des salariés et de leur exposition aux produits chimiques, le gouvernement et les producteurs ont entrepris des démarches pour améliorer la protection des ouvriers. Cela traduit une action sur le bien-être des travailleurs et la qualité de leur environnement de travail. Dans tous ces domaines, les actions de l'État visent à réguler et à améliorer les conditions de production, l’emploi, la gestion des ressources, la protection de l'environnement et la santé publique.

Обозначим эти векторы как AB и AC: AB = B - A = (-1 - 2, 3 - (-3), -1 - 1) = (-3, 6, -2) AC = C - A = (1 - 2, 6 - (-3), 5 - 1) = (-1, 9, 4) Чтобы найти угол между векторами, мы будем использовать скалярное произведение векторов, которое определяется формулой: AB · AC = |AB| * |AC| * cos(θ), где |AB| и |AC| — это длины векторов AB и AC соответственно, а θ — искомый угол между векторами. Длины векторов находим по формуле: |AB| = √(ABx^2 + ABy^2 + ABz^2), |AC| = √(ACx^2 + ACy^2 + ACz^2). Скалярное произведение векторов AB и AC равно: AB · AC = ABx * ACx + ABy * ACy + ABz * ACz. Вычислим длину вектора AB: |AB| = √((-3)^2 + 6^2 + (-2)^2) = √(9 + 36 + 4) = √49 = 7. Вычислим длину вектора AC: |AC| = √((-1)^2 + 9^2 + 4^2) = √(1 + 81 + 16) = √98 ≈ 9.8995. Теперь найдем скалярное произведение векторов AB и AC: AB · AC = (-3) * (-1) + 6 * 9 + (-2) * 4 = 3 + 54 - 8 = 49.

Теперь найдем угол θ, учитывая, что cos(θ) ≈ 0.7071: θ = arccos(0.7071). Вычислим это значение угла с помощью калькулятора: θ ≈ arccos(0.7071) ≈ 45°.

ServiceNow is an IT service management platform that is used to handle ITSM processes. If you're trying to count incidents, here's a general approach to how you might go about it: 1. Log in to your ServiceNow instance. 2. Navigate to the Incidents module. This can typically be found under the \\"Incident\\" application. 3. You can then create a filter to specify the criteria for the incidents you want to count. For example, if you want to count open incidents, you might filter by the Incident State field being set to \\"Open\\". 4. Once you've applied your filter, ServiceNow will display the list of incidents that match your criteria. 5. To see the count of incidents, you can look at the list footer, which will typically display the number of rows (incidents) that match your filter. If the list is paginated, make sure to account for all pages if you want to get the total count. 6. If you are looking to automate counting incidents, you could write a script or use a report. If by \\"by accident\\" you mean to identify or handle a scenario where something was counted incidentally or in error, you could perhaps set up a business rule or client script that checks for specific conditions when an incident is being updated or created, and then adjust the count accordingly. However, it's important to note that accidental or incidental logic should be managed carefully to ensure data integrity within ServiceNow. For more precise guidance, it's best to have a clearer understanding of the specific workflow or business rule you are referring to within ServiceNow.

This horrifying narrative explores themes of discrimination, hatred, and the dehumanization of \\"otherness.\\" In this alternate reality, humanity has colonized multiple planets and encountered various extraterrestrial species. As some humans gradually develop xenophobic tendencies, their fear and insecurity transform into a twisted ideology that justifies the annihilation of the Xenos. With immense technological advancements, the oppressors systematically wage war against the Xenos, perpetrating a genocide on a massive scale. The Xenos are depicted as a diverse, sentient race with unique abilities and cultural practices. However, these fascinating qualities are ruthlessly exploited and demonized by the humans, fueling the destruction and devaluation of their lives. The Xenos are subjected to appalling treatment, mass killings, enslavement, and brutal experiments. Through the eyes of multiple characters, Xenocaust delves deep into the harrowing realities experienced by both the victims and the oppressors. The story follows a courageous group of Xenos who resist their appalling fate, fighting for survival and freedom against overwhelming odds. Meanwhile, tortured human protagonists grapple with their complicity in this genocide, torn between their allegiance to their species and their growing empathy towards the Xenos. As the narrative progresses, Xenocaust explores the profound moral implications of such atrocities, challenging readers to confront their own biases and question the consequences of unchecked hatred and cruelty. The story delves into complex ethical and philosophical issues surrounding identity, perception of the \\"other,\\" and the true cost of unchecked power. Xenocaust is a graphic and emotionally charged exploration of the darkest corners of human nature, reaching beyond societal atrocities of the past to present a cautionary tale of the horrors that may lie ahead.

For example, Treufeld et al. developed novel polyimides by incorporating polar nitrile groups(-CN) with a high dipole moment of 3.9 Debye into the diamine monomers, resulting in an increase in permittivity. The more nitrile groups(-CN) that were grafted, the higher dipolar moments were obtained, leading to polyimides with even greater dielectric constant. (Treufeld et al., 2014) Consequently, sulfonyl groups (-S=O) with higher dipole moment (~4.5 D) are more attractive to the improvement of dielectric constant and energy storage performance. The dielectric constant is enhanced from 5.0 to 0.2 (at 50 ℃ and 1 kHz) and from 3.15 to 5.0 (at room temperature) with sulfonyl groups attached to the side chains of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and PEEK, respectively, while their working temperature is much lower due to their relatively low Tg. Further, improved high-temperature dielectric properties have been demonstrated in intrinsically heat-resistant polymers containing sulfonyl groups. A kind of copolyimide dielectric film, in which the sulfonyl groups are attached to the main chains of diamine moiety, exhibits an increased dielectric constant up to 4.45 and a reduced dielectric loss as low as 0.005 due to the enlarged chain spacing with large free volume fraction by the introduction of sulfone groups. Meanwhile, the copolyimides retain the good thermal properties of the pristine polyimide and maintain a relatively high breakdown strength with an energy density of 1.14 J/cm3 at 260 MV/m and 150 ℃. (polymer 256(2022) 125221) Similarly, the sulfonylated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) with sulfonyl groups in the side chains boosts the dielectric constant from 3.5 to 6.2 along with a substantial discharged energy density of 2.22 J/cm3 at 300 MV/m and 150 ℃. The presence of polar sulfonyl groups and the rigid PPO backbone give reason to the enhanced high temperature dielectric performance. Despite the unique advantages of molecular modification with sulfonyl groups demonstrated to improve the dielectric performance, excessive attention to this approach for polyimide is focused on introducing sulfonyl groups to the PI side chains or the main chains of diamine moieties. For the former, the side chain grafting process is much more complex and time-consuming. And for the latter, the resulted polyimide films have low molecular weight and are relatively brittle owing to the low reactivity of sulfonyl-containing diamine monomers.","output":"Paragraph: In recent years, significant advancements have been made in improving the dielectric constant of polymers by incorporating dipolar groups into the polymer chains.

그것도 잘 모르겠어요. 아시다시피 저는 저 혼자 세상의 비밀을 다 알고 있다고 떠드는 스타일이 아니랬어요. 그러나 이 갈등이 어디에서 시작됐는지는 사실 모든 언론, 모든 이야기가 공통적인 한 사람을 지적하고 있는 것 같습니다. 바로 김경율이에요. 저는 김경율이라는 사람을 개인적으로는 알지 못합니다. 그리고 어떤 루트로 국힘의 비대위에 들어가게 됐는지도 알지 못해요. 참여연대 출신이고 조국 사태를 겪으면서 스탠스에 변화가 있었던 사람입니다. 공식적으로 전향을 한 건지는 모르겠어요. 예를 들면 비슷한 시기에 비슷한 입장 변화를 겪은 사람들 중에 서민 교수는 공식적으로 전향선언을 했다고 본다면 전향선언이라는 건 어떤 정해진 양식이 있는 것은 아닙니다. 그래서 본인이 전향이라고 표현을 한다면 일종의 전향선언이라고 볼 수 있을 것이고 반면 김경율씨나 진중권씨는 적어도 제가 알기로는 전향을 공식화한 적은 없는 것 같아요. 그런데 며칠 전부터 김경율씨가 김건희 여사를 둘러싼 논란을 두고 공개적으로 지적을 하고 또 사과를 요구하고 나섰습니다. 명품백 수수에 대해서 사과를 하라고요. 그리고 논란이 불거지자 김경율씨는 한술 더 떠서 김건희 여사를 마리 앙투아네트에 비교하면서 프랑스 혁명은 마리 앙투아네트의 사치, 난잡한 사생활 이런 것들이 하나하나 드러나서 민중의 감정이 폭발된 것이라고 말하기도 했고요. 그 논란은 정치공작으로 벌어진 것이라는 여당 지도부의 시선을 두고 'PK의 시각이다, 선수만 늘어나기를 바라는 분들의 시각이다' 이런 발언을 하면서 대구, 경북 지역을 무시하는 발언을 했다, 지역 정치인들을 싸잡아 폄훼했다, 이런 논란에 또 한 번 휩싸였습니다. 우선 마리 앙투아네트, 프랑스 혁명의 상징과도 같은 인물이죠. 그런데 김경율씨가 이걸 몰랐을지, 알고 있었을지는 모르겠습니다만, 마리 앙투아네트의 사생활이나 사치 논란은 혁명분자들이 자신들의 광기를 정당화하기 위해서 만들어냈습니다. 마리 앙투아네트의 대사도 사실 마리 앙투아네트와는 아무런 관련이 없는 얘기입니다. 루소가 자기 책에, 심지어 마리 앙투아네트가 태어나기도 전을 회상하면서 쓴 문장을 마리 앙투아네트에게 덮어 씌운 것에 불과해요. 마리 앙투아네트의 대사도 사실 마리 앙투아네트와는 아무런 관련이 없는 얘기입니다. 루소가 자기 책에, 심지어 마리 앙투아네트가 태어나기도 전을 회상하면서 쓴 문장을 마리 앙투아네트에게 덮어 씌운 것에 불과해요. 앙투아네트는 프랑스 혁명의 상징으로 거짓으로 만들어진 겁니다. 그리고 저는 tk 출신도 아니고 국회의원 선수를 늘리려는 정치인도 아닌 사람으로서 말하는데 그 명품 파우치 사건이 정치 공작인 것은 누구누구의 시각 누구누구의 의견이 아니라 그냥 팩트입니다. 객관적인 사실이라고요. 분명한 의도를 가지고 접근해서 악의적인 시나리오 작업을 친거고 그 파우치를 사는 장면까지 녹화를 해서 영상으로 가지고 있다는 것 그리고 그 파우치를 샀다는 주체가 문제의 그걸 전달한 그 목사가 아니라 서울의 소리라는 것은 이게 시작부터 만들어진 쇼라는 것을 증명하는 겁니다 그놈의 파우치도 그자가 놔두고 간 걸 김여사도 놔두고 갔고 나중에 대통령실 직원이 뭔지 열어보았고 그대로 다른 대통령실에 들어오는 선물과 마찬가지로 대통령실로 가져가서 대통령실에서 공식적으로 보관하고 있어요 포장을 뜯은 적도 없고 사용한 적도 없습니다 형사 재판이 진행 중이라고 그래서 반환도 불가능해요 여기까지는 그냥 팩트라고 그 만남 자체가 없었으면 더 좋았겠다 맞아요 맞는데 사후적으로 그런 소리를 누가 못합니까 비트코인 오르기 전에 살 걸 떨어지기 전에 팔 걸 누가 그 소리를 못하나요 그럴 줄 알고 만난 게 아니잖아요 아버지 친구라고 보자고 계속 얘기하니까 마지못해 한번 만나주고 또 보자고 보자고 계속 그러니까 또 한번 만나주고 그렇게 두 번 만난 게 끝이고 그 자리에서 무슨 청탁이 있었느냐 부탁을 들어줬느냐 아무것도 안 해줬어요 그러니까 김건희라는 사람은 이 정치 공작 사건에서 본질적으로 피해자의 입장인 거지 사과를 해야 되는 입장이 아닙니다 뭐라고 사과를 해야 되나요 아버지 친구라길래 만나서 죄송합니다 선물 놓고 간 걸 미리 막지 못해 죄송합니다 그 자리에서 뜯어 보지 않아서 죄송합니다 차라리 시계에 몰카 달고 들어가는 걸 왜 못 잡아 냈느냐 대통령실 경호 관리에 미지남이 있었다고 사과를 한다면 그건 차라리 말이 되죠 몰카가 아니라 폭탄이었으면 어땠어요 독극물이었으면 어땠을 뻔 했습니까? 피해자가 나서서 사과를 한다 대한민국 정치에서 사과를 하면 무슨 일이 벌어지는지 우리는 너무나 잘 알고 있지 않아요? 사과를 하면 문제가 봉합되고 민주당이 물러서던가요? 언론이 사과를 했으니까 이제 됐고 마무리 됐고 다른 얘기 합시다 이렇게 나오던가요? 국민들에게 설명을 해야 된다고 말했다면 차라리 받아들일 수 있겠습니다 어차피 벌어진 일 저것들도 어차피 계속 떠들어 댈 일 뭔가 클로저가 필요하다 하는 주장이라면 그건 지금 상황에서는 고려의 봄직 하다고 치고요 사과를 요구한다 줄리 거짓말해도 사과를 했었어야 됩니까 청담동 술자리도 사과 했었어야 돼요 누군가가 요구하고 있으니까 그리고 더 큰 문제는 뭐냐 이 사건의 본질을 다 떠나서 어떤 개인이 이 사건에 대해서 사과가 필요하다고 판단했다 좋습니다 개인이야 어떤 생각이든 할 수 있으니까요 그런데 문제는 김경율 씨는 지금 참여연대 소속의 개인인가요? 아닙니다 국힘의 비대위원이에요 당직을 가지고 있는 사람이고 당의 지도부라고 그러면 하고 싶은 이야기가 있으면 내부에서 그 이야기를 해야지 그걸 왜 유튜브 채널 같은데 출연해서 떠들고 있습니까 말을 전달할 통로가 전혀 없어서 외부에 말을 할 수밖에 없었다 이것도 아니고 당 내부에서 회의할 때 말하면 되는 거잖아요 그걸 왜 밖에다가 이야기하냐고 왜 언론 기사로 그걸 접하게 하냐고 이거 누가 하던 짓이랑 똑같은 짓 아닙니까? 여기에서 꼭 이런 지적을 하는 사람들이 있어요 그런데 이건 표현의 자유의 영역이 아닙니다 자기 조직을 외부에 나가서 까는 건 책임을 다하지 못하는 무책임한 행동이에요 비판은 당 내 공식 루트를 통하거나 아니면 직을 먼저 내려놓고 자연인으로 돌아가서 하면 됩니다 어디 가서 한마디 찍 흘리고 비판 받으면 다른데 가서 더 심하게 찍 흘리고 욕 먹으면 더 더 심하게 흘리고 참여연대 때 하던 버릇을 직을 받고도 그대로 하고 있는 거 아닌가요? 국회의원에 출마하겠다고 선언을 했는데 국회의원이 돼서도 저런 식으로 행동을 할 겁니까? 언론에 자기당 욕하고 유튜브에 출연해서 자기당 대통령 욕하고 그런 사람 이제 더는 필요 없다구요. 이건 그 판단이 옳다 틀리다 그 내용이 옳다 틀리다의 여부 이전에 이미 문제가 있는 행동입니다. 결국 지금 본인의 행동 때문에 무슨 일이 벌어졌는지 보십시오. 당론과도 다른 얘기를 하지 상황을 수습하려고 하는 용산과도 전혀 다른 얘기를 하지 당 입장에서는 황당할 수 밖에요 그래서 그걸 지적했더니 그건 대구 경북 니들이나 하는 생각이지 이렇게 답변을 하는 건 대체 어디에서 배운 버릇일까요 저 말이 지금 당의 일원으로서 하는 얘기입니까 당의 일원으로서 그 입에서 나오는 이야기입니까 전혀 아니잖아요 한동훈 위원장 역시 여기에 대해서 사과해라 이렇게 말을 한 적이 없죠 한동훈 위원장이 어떻게든 수습하려고 더 문제 삼지 않으려고 이야기하고 넘어갔으면 자중을 해야 되는데 더 심한 말 그보다 더 심한 말 소속자가 발전을 하잖아요 왜 당내에서 당직자로서 그 얘기를 하냐고 그냥 참여연대에 가서 해도 되잖아요 사람마다 생각 다를 수 있습니다 말 다를 수 있죠 그런데 왜 당직자로서 그걸 하냐는 겁니다 입을 봉하고 있어도 모자랄 판에 국힘당 대 김경률 외로운 장판파의 싸움 이런 그림이라도 그리고 싶은 건가요 정치를 시작하기도 전에 벌써 자기 정치만 하고 있어요 저는 김경률의 거취를 두고 이래라 저래라 하고 싶지는 않습니다 그건 전적으로 한동훈 위원장이 결정할 문제고요 그런데 본인이 계속 그런 행동을 한다면 그 누가 믿고 지지를 보낼까요? 지금 참여연대 활동 중인 거 아닙니다 밥 먹고 트림만 해도 국힘 비대위원이 트림한 게 되는 그런 위치에 가 있는 겁니다 용산의 어디에서 어디까지가 이 이야기에 참여한 건지는 알 수 없으나 어쨌든 정황상 한 위원장의 사퇴 이야기가 나온 것은 사실입니다 일각에서 이준석 같은 인간들이 이거 짜고 치는 거다 이러고 있던데 그건 정말 이준석 이준석 수준의 생각인 것 같고요. 짜고 치는 거 아닙니다. 저는 여기에서 누구 편을 들 것도 아니고 이게 누구 편을 들 문제도 아닌 것 같고요. 상황을 정리하면 간단합니다. 지금 현재 구도에서는 한동훈에게는 윤석열이 필요하고 윤석열에게는 한동훈이 필요합니다. 한 위원장이 비대위원장이 되기 전에 다른 사람으로 비대위원장이 정해졌다면 모를까. 이미 그 난리를 겪고 당대표가 둘이나 물러나고 난 후의 비대위입니다. 국민들은 지지자들은 그만큼 피로도가 가득한 거예요. 꼴도 보기 싫었던 국힘의 한자락 희망을 다시 한번 걸어보는 것은 한동훈이라는 사람이 선거 승리를 100% 보장하기 때문이 아니라 이 패배의 냄새가 가득한 집구석에 그나마 실바람이 불어오기 시작했기 때문이에요. 지금 와서 다른 사람 예를 들어서 한 위원장이 물러나고 누군가가 비대위원장으로 등판한다 그러면 그 세 사람이 잘하고 못하고는 이미 의미 없는 얘기예요. 왜? 잘할 기회조차 없을 테니까. 그 순간 그냥 게임 쐬시고 국힘은 100석도 안 되는 경상도 지역 정당으로 찌그러지게 될 수도 있습니다. 대통령은 180석, 190석짜리 민주당에 짓눌려서 3년 동안 아무것도 못하고 이재명 대통령 앞에 카페트나 까는 시간을 보내다가 정권 교체되고 끝날 수도 있어요. 한동훈 위원장이 능력 있는 사람이겠습니다만 한 위원장의 능력이 너무나 대단해서 우리를 구원해줄 사람은 오직 한동훈 뿐이라는 얘기를 하려는 게 아닙니다. 지지자들의 마음에 정치 혐오를 심어줄수록 표심은 떨어지기 마련이죠. 결국 이재명만 신나는 거에요. 아마도 어제 대한민국에서 가장 잘 잔 사람이 자기 전에 이 이야기를 들은 이재명과 이준석일 겁니다. 이재명 이준석만 웃고 있는 거에요. 이준석 쪽 애들은 벌써부터 거부하라 신당이 답이다 이러고 다니고 있습니다. 총선 전에 세 판을 짜는 것은 이제 그만해야 됩니다. 저도 피곤해요. 정치 초고관여층인 저도 피곤하다고요. 공정한 공천이 이루어져야겠죠. 잡음 최소화 해야겠죠. 당연히 그래야 되지만 그건 이제부터 만들어 나가면 됩니다. 오늘 돌아다니는 무수한 찌라시들 중에 이런 문구가 있더라고요. 당 중진을 중심으로 안정된 체제를 구성하고 4주 전만 해도 불가능했던 당 중진을 중심으로 구성된 안정된 체제가 갑자기 가능해지기라도 했다는 말인가요?

To fix this issue, you need to adjust the threshold values based on the range of values you are getting from the potentiometer. You can do this by experimenting with different values and observing the behavior of the LEDs. Start by measuring the minimum and maximum values you get from the potentiometer when you turn it to its minimum and maximum positions. Use these values to set the thresholds accordingly. For example, if the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1023, you can divide the range into equal parts to set the thresholds.

Below is an overview of the steps you might need to take. Please note that the specifics might vary based on your environment and Veritas InfoScale version – the latest version as of the knowledge cutoff date is 8.0, so I will provide steps based on that. It is also critical to consult the official documentation for your specific version of InfoScale as these steps can be complex and system-specific. 1. Prepare the New Node: a. Ensure that the Linux operating system and hardware configuration of the new node matches that of the existing cluster nodes. b. Install Veritas InfoScale on the new node following the installation instructions provided by Veritas for your specific Linux distribution. 2. Configure Networking: a. Assign IP addresses to the new node for all networks that the cluster uses, including public, private, and I/O fencing networks. 3. Configure SSH: a. Set up SSH keys between the new node and the existing cluster nodes to enable password-less SSH access. 4. Join the New Node to the Cluster: a. On the new node, run the \`hasys -add\` command to add the system definition to the cluster configuration. \`\`\` # hasys -add <new_node_name> \`\`\` b. Run the \`hasys -force\` command to propagate the updated configuration. \`\`\` # hasys -force <new_node_name> \`\`\` 5. Configure I/O Fencing: a. Register the new node with I/O fencing by updating the configuration with the \`vxfenconfig\` command. \`\`\` # vxfenconfig -a -c /etc/vxfenmode \`\`\` b. Start the I/O fencing daemon on the new node. \`\`\` # vxfenstart \`\`\` 6. Configure VVR: a. Integrate the new node into VVR replication configurations as needed. b. Modify RVG (Replicated Volume Group) configurations to include the new node, if necessary. 7. Configure GCO: a. Update the GCO configuration on the new node to include it in the global cluster setups. b. Update the wide-area connectors and configure the global service groups as required. 8. Verify Configuration: a. Verify that the cluster configuration is correct and that the new node is fully integrated. \`\`\` # hastatus -sum \`\`\` b. Test failover and failback to ensure that the cluster operates correctly with the new node. 9. Synchronize Service Groups (if applicable): a. Bring any critical service groups offline safely and then online again to ensure that the new node is recognized. b. Adjust any application-specific configurations as needed. Throughout these steps, it is critical to have the Veritas InfoScale documentation on hand for reference as configurations can be quite complex. Additionally, always back up the existing cluster configuration before making changes and test configurations in a non-production environment whenever possible. Please note that these steps are a general guideline; actual commands and configuration steps can differ based on your specific setup and Veritas InfoScale version.

Here are steps to verify these aspects: # Operating System Version 1. **Check OS Version on Existing Nodes and New Node:** Use the command \`cat /etc/os-release\` or \`cat /etc/redhat-release\` (depending on your distribution) to check the version and build of Linux on both the existing nodes and the new node. \`\`\`bash cat /etc/os-release # or cat /etc/redhat-release \`\`\` 2. **Kernel Version:** Kernel versions should also be consistent across nodes. Check the kernel version using: \`\`\`bash uname -r \`\`\` 3. **Package Versions:** Ensure that important packages, especially those related to Veritas InfoScale, are of the same version: For Veritas packages, run: \`\`\`bash rpm -qa | grep VRTS \`\`\` For other packages relevant to your cluster services, use: \`\`\`bash rpm -qa | less \`\`\` # Hardware Configuration: 1. **CPU and Memory:** To check CPU and memory specifications, use: \`\`\`bash lscpu free -h \`\`\` 2. **Disk Configuration:** Since Veritas InfoScale heavily relies on storage configuration, confirm the disk layout is similar across all nodes: \`\`\`bash lsscsi fdisk -l \`\`\` 3. **Network Configuration:** Check network interface names, IPs assigned to them, and other network configurations: \`\`\`bash ip addr show nmcli con show \`\`\` 4. **Shared Storage Visibility:** The new node must have visibility to the same shared storage as the other nodes. Use \`vxdisk list\` or \`multipath -ll\` to view the SAN-connected disks. 5. **Hardware Compatibility:** If possible, check the hardware compatibility list (HCL) provided by Veritas to ensure your server model, and its internal components are supported by the version of InfoScale you are using. 6. **BIOS/Firmware Versions:** While not always necessary to match perfectly, it's worth noting their versions in case of troubleshooting issues that might be related to firmware: \`\`\`bash dmidecode -t bios \`\`\` # Sync Package and Kernel Updates After you've confirmed the versions, you might need to standardize them across nodes: 1. **Update OS Packages:** If updates are needed, use your distribution's package manager (such as \`yum\` or \`dnf\` for Red Hat-based distributions, \`apt\` for Debian-based distributions). 2. **Kernel Updates:** If you upgrade the kernel, you will need to reboot the node to apply the changes. Ensure all nodes are using the same kernel version. 3. **Update Veritas InfoScale Packages:** Use the specific instructions from Veritas to upgrade or update InfoScale packages. # Validation After you have verified and possibly synchronized the OS and hardware configurations, rerun the checks to confirm that the new node now matches the existing cluster nodes. Remember, after making changes to kernel versions or key hardware settings, a reboot of the new node might be necessary.
