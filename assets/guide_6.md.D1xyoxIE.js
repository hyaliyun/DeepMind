Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  take her anti-psychotic medication  for the following movie plot:  A 19-year-old girl named Emily Rose dies, attributed to self-inflicted wounds and malnutrition. After news of it spreads across town, a Catholic priest named Father Richard Moore is arrested and sent to court. The archdiocese wishes for Father Moore to plead guilty, in order for publicity of the incident to be minimized. A lawyer named Erin Bruner is provided to Father Moore to negotiate a plea deal, but Father Moore insists on pleading not guilty. Bruner takes the case, believing it will elevate her to senior partner at her law firm. Father Moore agrees to let her defend him only if he is allowed to tell Emily's story. The trial begins with the calling of several medical experts by the prosecutor Ethan Thomas, and Judge Brewster presiding. One expert testifies that Emily was suffering from both epilepsy and psychosis. The defense contests that she may have actually been possessed but Bruner explains that Emily was suffering from something that neither medicine nor psychology could explain, and that Father Moore as well as her family realized this and tried to help in another way. Several flashbacks reveal the story leading up to the exorcism. Emily gets a scholarship to a university to study for a bachelor's degree in education. After days pass, strange events occur. In her dorm room one night, at 3:00 AM, Emily smells a strange burning smell from the hallway. Attempting to investigate it, she sees a door open and shut itself several times. She then sees a writing material jar move by itself. Emily sees her bed covers roll themselves down, and a great weight pins her in bed along with a force which also proceeds to choke her and seemingly to possess her momentarily. Through these episodes Emily wonders if they are true or just a hallucination. She suffers more of these visions such as people's faces demonically distorting, and being unable to eat. She is hospitalized, and diagnosed with epilepsy. Anti-seizure medications and treatment fail to cure her. A classmate named Jason brings her back home to her...

Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

Write a title for this article: This is a rush transcript from \\"On the Record,\\" December 14, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Police telling us it will take days to process the gruesome crime scene, 26 people, 20 just mere children slaughtered inside the elementary school. Now, we spoke with Connecticut State Police Lieutenant Paul Vance. VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to see you, sir. LT. PAUL VANCE, CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE: Thank you very having us. VAN SUSTEREN: Lieutenant, you know, we've seen so many of these across the country and going back even as long as Columbine and before that. You never think it's going to happen in your own community, do you. VANCE: No, you don't. This is something that is horrific, it's tragic. These parents sent these children to school today to be educated and they never expected never to see them again. And it's just a heartbreaking tragedy that this community's enduring. VAN SUSTEREN: And you think right now -- you haven't identified all the bodies for the families, have you. VANCE: We have not. We have tentative identification. We have a process where we have to positively identify everyone, and we want certainly to do that as expeditiously as possible. We're working on that as we speak right now. We'll work right through the night. It's important for the families and we understand that. VAN SUSTEREN: But just imagine, you're home tonight and you haven't gotten the official word, but your child isn't home, so you know that your child was one of the victims. I mean, it's inevitable. I mean, imagine that pain. VANCE: It's -- it's unbelievable. I mean, it's something that no one really ever wants to bear, and it was heartbreaking to have to hear the parents being told that their children were not coming home. It was heartbreaking for the law enforcement officers to go in to rescue as many people as they did, as many staffers as they did, and then encounter what they discovered in those last two classrooms. VAN SUSTEREN: Was the situation where the killer killed everybody in one single room, so that he killed an entire class? VANCE: No, it wasn't -- it wasn't like that, and it's even difficult to talk about. But suffice to say that, you know, there were deceased in two classrooms and the hallway, and it was a horrific scene. VAN SUSTEREN: Was he known to law enforcement? Because sometimes, these people who come in here and to that, you know, their names are familiar to law enforcement. They've been around. VANCE: We're looking at that. We have a State Police command investigation under way. We've brought in major crime detectives. We've had the Newtown police detectives working with us. And we're going to answer all those questions. We're going to do an extensive background on the shooter, going back as far as we need to go. We're going to answer every question about the history and historical -- any historical events that this young man may have been involved n. We'll leave no stone unturned. VAN SUSTEREN: Has the school indicated that they know him? Had his mother ever complained about him or said anything about him that she was worried about him? VANCE: There's nothing that showed that something like this could occur. But again, our investigators will look at all of that. We'll certainly interview all the administration of the school, superintendent, friends, family, relatives, co-workers. The list is endless, and we will certainly do everything we can to answer all those questions. VAN SUSTEREN: One thing that I was sort of curious -- I didn't quite understand, maybe you can clear it up for me, is that -- that I've read or heard that the mother was found dead at her home and that she's also a teacher. So was she not teaching now or was she not -- did she call in sick? Or why wasn't she at school today, do you know? VANCE: I've got to -- I've got to say we haven't identified officially anyone yet. So I'm in a position where I can tell you we have a secondary scene with a deceased female, who we tentatively have identified. And those are questions that we have and those are questions that we have to answer. And at this point in time, we haven't answered them yet. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, can you tell me whether there was a substitute teacher in that classroom? VANCE: That I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. VAN SUSTEREN: And so -- and right now, medical examiners in with those children and the adults? VANCE: Yes, the medical examiner's at the scene with a team, and he has his team in place and they're going to work right through the night. They're going to do whatever they need to do, again, to identify these children for these families. VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I can't -- you know, every time I've covered these stories, you know, the police officers, the law enforcement -- I mean, they're all parents. And you know, and they go into these scenes and it's, like, you know, it's -- it's unthinkable and unspeakable. I mean, they've all got kids these -- you know, the age of these children. VANCE: Yes. It's a very difficult scene for them. The law enforcement officers that entered that building, we've provided them with counseling. We have the briefers with them. We did the same for the family. We brought in clergy. It's hard. It's very hard for law enforcement, the fire service, EMS personnel, but certainly nothing like the parents are going through. VAN SUSTEREN: No, no parent wants to send his child to school that's essentially a prison and with a lot of metal detectors and security and everything else. But I'm curious. With this school, any security? Not that I'm any way condemning them if it hasn't because it -- you know, both -- it goes both ways. VANCE: Suffice it to say that the school was secure. It was very secure. And we will certainly determine exactly how the shooter was able to gain access. VAN SUSTEREN: Secure in a sense that if I tried to get in, somebody would stop me? Is it that kind of security? You've got -- someone's got to me in? VANCE: That's correct. You could not have gotten in. VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir, and good luck. I know it's tough on you, and everybody in the community, especially the families of the dead. Thank you, sir.","output":"\\"Connecticut School Tragedy: A Heartbreaking Scene Unfolds - An Interview with Lt. Paul Vance\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius Ahenobarbus ran for the consulship in 55 BC promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55 BC, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Crassus led an ill-fated expedition with legions led by his son, Caesar's lieutenant, against the Kingdom of Parthia. This resulted in his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae. Finally, Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.

Guidelines: The main clause of the sentence is 'Everyone held their breaths as a horde of men charged into the room'. The object of a sentence is the person, thing, or place that is receiving the action of the verb. In this case, the action is 'charged' and the object of the action is 'a horde of men'. To decide if the object is singular or plural, we need to check the noun 'a horde of men'. When we have a phrase like 'a horde of...', whatever comes after 'of' will determine if the overall phrase is singular or plural. Here 'men' is plural. Therefore, the phrase 'a horde of men' is seen as plural because of the word 'men'.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"After analyzing the given task, it appears that you have not provided any specific methods to compare. However, I will suggest several effective methods to prevent your clothes from smelling like mildew in the closet. You can evaluate these methods based on your available resources and preferences before choosing the most reasonable method that suits your needs. 1. Proper ventilation and air circulation: Ensure that your closet has proper ventilation to allow air circulation. Open closet doors or install vents, as good air flow aids in evaporating moisture before it causes mildew growth. You can also use a small fan to promote air circulation. 2. Keep clothes clean and dry before storing: Washing and completely drying your clothes before storing them in the closet can significantly reduce the risk of mildew. Damp clothes can encourage mold and mildew growth, so make sure that your clothes are completely dry before hanging or folding them into the closet. 3. Use a dehumidifier: A dehumidifier can help regulate the humidity levels in the area, thereby reducing the chances of mildew development. Portable and compact dehumidifiers are available in the market and can be placed near the closet to maintain optimal humidity. 4. Use moisture-absorbing products: There are various moisture-absorbing products available, such as silica gel packs or moisture absorber tubs, which can be placed inside the closet. These products help reduce excess moisture, thereby preventing mildew growth. 5. Regularly clean the closet: Periodically declutter and clean your closet to remove any mold spores or mildew. Wipe down the shelves, walls, and other surfaces with a vinegar-water solution (1 part white vinegar and 1 part water) or mild bleach solution. This can help prevent mildew build-up. 6. Use essential oils or natural odor absorbers: Certain essential oils, like tea tree oil and lavender oil, have natural antimicrobial properties that can help prevent mold and mildew growth. Additionally, you can place odor-absorbing materials like activated charcoal, baking soda, or coffee grounds in your closet to help neutralize any potential odors. 7. Avoid overcrowding: Do not overstuff your closet, as it can limit air circulation and trap moisture. Give your clothes enough room to breathe, which will help prevent mildew growth. 8. Periodically air out clothes: Take your clothes out of the closet occasionally and expose them to sunlight and fresh air. Sunlight and proper air circulation can help prevent mildew growth and eliminate any existing odors. In summary, several methods can help you keep your clothes from smelling like mildew. Some key factors to consider when selecting the most reasonable method include the effectiveness of the method, ease of implementation, cost, and your personal preferences. By combining multiple methods, you can effectively create an environment that inhibits the growth of mold and mildew, thus ensuring your clothes remain fresh and odor-free."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Carignan (also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Samsó, and Carignane) is a red Spanish/French wine grape variety that is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was once considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley.  - A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \\"châteaux\\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine.  - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 78 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period.  - Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.  - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\".  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan , it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour , but is mostly blended into bulk wines . The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine , and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine . Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines , it does carry their fruitful essence . The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California 's hot climate , specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys . Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural , special acidity .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Beqaa Valley (',  ), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in Classical antiquity as Coele-Syria, is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).  - The wine lake refers to the continuing supply surplus of wine produced in the European Union. A major contributor to that glut is the Languedoc-Roussillon, which produces over one-third of the grapes grown in France. In 2007 it was reported that for the previous several vintages, European countries had been producing 1.7 billion more bottles of wine than they sell. Hundreds of millions of bottles of wine are turned into industrial alcohol every year, a practice that is sometimes described as \\"emergency distillation\\".  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.  - Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.  - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.  - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work.  - \\"Jug wine\\" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or \\"bulk wine\\") typically bottled in a glass jug.   - Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name \\"Merlot\\" is thought to be a diminutive of \\"merle\\", the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \\"fleshiness\\", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.  - Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into ice wine in those regions.    What entity does 'ruby cabernet' has the relation 'instance of' with? Answer:","output":"Ruby Cabernet has the relation 'instance of' with the entity of grape variety. It is a specific red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan, designed to produce an inexpensive table wine with characteristics of both parent varieties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye. contains an answer for the question: What is the nickname of the person who meets Violet Worthing at training camp?, what is it ?

Article: How far would you be willing to go to satisfy your need to know?Far enough to find out your possibility of dying from a terrible disease?These days that's more than an academic question,as Tracy Smith reports in our Cover Story. There are now more than a thousand genetic  tests,for everything from baldness to breast cancer,and the list is growing.Question is,do you really want to know what might eventually kill you?For instance,Nobel Prizewinning scientist James Watson,one of the first people to map their entire genetic makeup,is said to have asked not to be told if he were at a higher risk for Alzheimer's . \\"If I tell you that you have an increased risk of getting a terrible disease,that could weigh on your mind and make you anxious,through which you see the rest of your life as you wait for that disease to hit you.It could really mess you up.\\" said Dr.Robert Green,a Harvard geneticist. \\"Every ache and pain,\\" Smith suggested,could be understood as \\"the beginning of the end.\\"\\"That's right.If you ever worried you were at risk for Alzheimer's disease,then every time you can't find your car in the parking lot,you think the disease has started.\\" Dr.Green has been thinking about this issue for years.He led a study of people who wanted to know if they were at a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's.It was thought that people who got bad news would,for lack of a better medical term, _ .But Green and his team found that there was \\"no significant difference\\" between how people handled good news and possibly the worst news of their lives.In fact,most people think they can handle it.People who ask for the information usually can handle the information,good or bad,said Green.

Write a question about the following article: At home for the first time in three weeks, the Patriots, looking to remain unbeaten, faced off against the 4-2 Redskins. After spending the first seven weeks of the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list, defensive end Richard Seymour was activated for the game, but did not start. Following a Redskins punt, in their first possession of the game, the Patriots drove 90&#160;yards over more than 7&#160;minutes, finishing the drive with a 3-yard Brady rushing touchdown, continuing a season-long opening drive scoring streak. The teams exchanged punts into the second quarter, before a 67-yard Patriots drive was capped off with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Vrabel, his second for the season and the tenth of his career (including playoffs). On the Redskins' ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of Jason Campbell at the Redskins' 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by Phillip Daniels at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&#160;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&#160;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&#160;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins' 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24-0 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in 2004 and 2002, but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games. On the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&#160;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots' lead to 38-0. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots' 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&#160;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45-0. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots' next series, Cassel replaced Brady. A 21-yard pass from Cassel to Gaffney gave the Patriots their 33rd first down of the game, a new single-game franchise record. Two plays later, Cassel ran it in for a touchdown from 15&#160;yards out, and the first rushing touchdown of his career, increasing the Patriots' lead to 52-0; the touchdown was the longest rushing touchdown by a Patriots quarterback in more than 20 years. The Redskins then drove 63&#160;yards and scored their only points of the game on a 15-yard Chris Cooley touchdown reception. Third-string quarterback Matt Gutierrez replaced Cassel on the next possession, a three-and-out. The Redskins then punted back to the Patriots to end the game. The Patriots' 52-7 win gave them an 8-0 record heading into a Week 9 matchup against the 7-0 Colts.  It also made Brady only the second quarterback to defeat the other 31 teams at least once; the Colts' Peyton Manning was the first to accomplish the feat, having done so earlier that day.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: Why did the group pick the color orange? === The answer to the above question is Choose from:  (a). Because the FBI likes it  (b). not enough information  (c).

Unfortunately, however, his writing is often a vehicle for a philosophy of neo-anarchist romanticism and anti-intellectualism. This book, which deals with the implausible concept of mind control through deep programming, is basically an anti-intellectual diatribe. Intellectuals and government are seen as the source of all the problems in the world, and we are told that action guided by moral purpose is all that is needed. We are supposed to learn how to live from the superior wisdom of dogs.

Q: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Question: Why did IMB hire so many designers? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"IBM hired so many designers as a part of their design thinking revolution, led by Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design. The goal of this initiative was to transform the company and adapt to the rapidly changing business environment by incorporating design thinking principles into its core business practices. There were several key reasons behind hiring such a large number of designers: 1. Infusing design thinking into the organization: IBM wanted to ensure that design thinking became an integral part of the company's culture. By bringing in designers from diverse backgrounds, they aimed to foster a creative, user-centered mindset among the workforce. 2. Enhancing product and service development: Designers play a crucial role in shaping products and services that cater to the needs of users. Having a large pool of designers allowed IBM to work on multiple projects simultaneously, ensuring that each product or service met user requirements and provided superior experience. 3. Accelerating innovation: The presence of a large number of designers enabled IBM to generate new ideas quickly, iterate on them, and bring innovative solutions to the market faster. Designers have significantly contributed to the company's innovation pipeline. 4. Strengthening collaboration and cross-functional teams: Designers at IBM work closely with other departments like engineering, marketing, and sales, promoting a collaborative environment and more effective communication. This increased collaboration has been key to the development of innovative solutions that address complex business problems. 5. Staff training and upskilling: With over 1,000 designers on board, IBM provided design thinking training to over 8,000 of its managers and staff. Although this number represents a small portion of the entire workforce, it demonstrates IBM's commitment to invest in employee development and create a more design-driven organization. In summary, IBM hired a significant number of designers to instill a design thinking mindset within the company, improve product and service offerings, accelerate innovation, boost collaboration, and train its workforce in design thinking principles.

I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties  did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province. At the moment the Milu deer live in centres where they are being well protected and cared for. It is hoped that one day there will be enough animals to let them live in the wild again. 294words Question: After some of the Milu deer were taken to Britain,_.

Known as one of the Philadelphia Phillies' greatest pitchers, Roberts left an indelible mark on the sport as he led the Whiz Kids, a group of young and talented players, to win the 1950 National League Pennant. This incredible achievement set the stage for a golden era in the Phillies' history, and Roberts' inspiring leadership is still remembered fondly by fans and colleagues alike. Early Life and Career: Born Robin Evan Roberts on September 30, 1926, in Springfield, Illinois, he spent his early years honing his skills in both basketball and baseball as a multi-sport athlete. Following a short stint at Michigan State University, Roberts was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1948 and made his Major League debut the following year. His impressive fastball and tireless work ethic quickly established him as the team's ace pitcher. During the 1950 MLB season, Roberts helped secure the Phillies' first National League Pennant in 35 years, earning the nickname of \\"Whiz Kids.\\" This success was not only a testament to Roberts' exceptional skill but also his innate leadership qualities, which won him the admiration and respect of his teammates. Leading the Whiz Kids: The 1950 Phillies' team predominantly consisted of young, inexperienced players, collectively known as the Whiz Kids. Their average age was just 26, and they seemed unlikely to win a championship. However, Robin Roberts' unwavering commitment to excellence propelled the team forward. As the team's star pitcher, Roberts had an incredible season in 1950. He secured 20 wins, a feat he would achieve in six consecutive seasons. His exceptional performances on the mound and leadership off the field enabled the Whiz Kids to defy the odds and clinch the National League Pennant in a tense, winner-take-all game against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Roberts' Resilience and Rewards: Robin Roberts' claim to fame did not come without challenges. In 1950, he suffered a near-fatal accident when a line drive fractured his skull. Incredibly, after just three weeks of recovery, he returned to pitch and played an instrumental role in winning the pennant. Throughout his career, Roberts was consistently recognized for his achievements on the field. He was selected to seven All-Star games, becoming the first National League pitcher to start five of the games. In 1962, Roberts became the first Phillies' pitcher to receive an honorary plaque in the team's Wall of Fame, a testament to his lasting legacy in the hearts of Philadelphia baseball fans. Later Years and Legacy: Roberts played a total of 19 seasons in Major League Baseball, with stints on the Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, and Chicago Cubs. He retired from professional baseball in 1966 with 286 career wins, a total of 45 shutouts, and an astonishing 2,357 strikeouts under his belt. In retirement, Roberts turned his attention to coaching and administration. He served as a front-office executive for various teams, including the Reading Phillies, and coached at the University of South Florida. His profound knowledge of the game allowed him to cultivate future generations of baseball players. Robin Roberts’ life was a testament to the enduring power of hard work, dedication, and determination. He led a group of young, inexperienced players to achieve baseball greatness, establishing a lasting legacy that remains woven into the fabric of Philadelphia Phillies' history. His story is a reminder that with passion and perseverance, seemingly insurmountable odds can be overcome, and true success can be achieved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary has been experiencing some health issues lately.  Which person has a stronger immune system?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. A:","output":"Based on the provided information and hint, it can be concluded that Ann, who is in her late 40's, is likely to have a stronger immune system.

Question: What crashes into Melancholia? Movie title: Melancholia Movie plot: The film begins with an introductory sequence involving the main characters and images from space and introducing many of the film's visual leitmotifs. These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one.

Justine happens to notice a particularly bright red star in the twilight sky which John identifies as Antares.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding. However Justines sister ,Claire, who represents order urges Justine to dishonestly hide her debilitating melancholy from her bland, gormless, doting husband, Michael, (This is highlighted by his wedding speech) and anyway...","output":"the Earth crashes into the rogue planet named Melancholia.

Write an article based on this summary: Learn about the process of growing grapes. Decide what your vineyard will be for. Study your local climate. Select a grape variety. Consider grafted vines. Choose the area where you will be planting. Test the soil. Article:","output":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Growing Grapes: From Selection to Harvest Introduction Growing grapes can be an enjoyable and rewarding endeavor, whether you're looking to start your own vineyard or simply cultivate grapes for personal use. However, to ensure the best possible outcome, it is essential to understand the ins and outs of grape cultivation. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to grow grapes, from selecting the appropriate grape variety to testing the soil before planting. Step 1: Establishing the Purpose of Your Vineyard The first step in growing grapes is determining the purpose of your vineyard. Are you looking to produce wine, raisins, or fresh table grapes? The end goal will determine which grape varieties to consider, as well as the cultivation techniques, grapevine maintenance, and harvesting practices. Step 2: Studying Your Local Climate Before you can begin growing grapes, it is vital to understand your local climate, as grapes are sensitive to temperature variations and rainfall levels. Consult local agricultural agencies or extension offices for information on the ideal growing conditions for different grape varieties in your region. This will provide a solid foundation for your decision-making process when choosing a grape variety. Step 3: Selecting a Grape Variety Once you have determined the purpose of your vineyard and studied your local climate, it is time to select a grape variety. Grape varieties are classified into three categories: table grape varieties, which are most commonly consumed fresh; wine grape varieties, which are specifically cultivated for wine production; and raisin grape varieties, intended for drying. Selecting a grape variety that aligns with the purpose of your vineyard and your local climate is essential for the success of your grape-growing endeavor. Step 4: Considering Grafted Vines Grafted vines are created by attaching a desired grape variety to a rootstock, which is a separate plant chosen for its root system compatibility and ability to combat soil-borne pests and diseases. Grafted vines can be an excellent choice for beginners or those looking to expedite their grape production process, as they generally have shorter establishment times and require less pruning. Consult with local vineyard experts to determine if grafted vines are an ideal option for your location and desired grape variety. Step 5: Choosing the Planting Area Selecting the right area to plant your grapevines is of utmost importance. Grapes require ample sunlight and well-drained, fertile soil. In addition, the planting area should have a slight slope to prevent soil erosion and promote air circulation. Make sure to choose an area that provides adequate space for your desired vine density, as overcrowding can lead to disease and poor grape production. Step 6: Testing the Soil The final step before planting your grapevines is testing the soil to ensure it is suitable for grape cultivation. Grapes prefer soil with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5, and soil testing can reveal potential deficiencies or issues that may need to be addressed prior to planting. Consult with local agricultural agencies or extension offices for information on soil testing laboratories and services in your area. Conclusion Grape cultivation can be a highly rewarding experience, providing both a sense of personal accomplishment and, in time, a bountiful harvest. By following these steps and critically assessing each aspect of the grape-growing process, you will be well on your way to establishing a thriving vineyard that can be enjoyed for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Q: Because several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to determining height in humans, height is considered what kind of trait?

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.  James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection. After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F.  Given a person is recovering from a fever, will their body temperature be increasing or decreasing? Answer:","output":"Given that a person is recovering from a fever, their body temperature will be decreasing. In James's case, his fever of 100.6°F is higher than the normal body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C). As his body continues to fight the bacterial infection and he begins to recover, his body temperature will gradually decrease back towards the normal range, indicating that his immune system is managing the infection."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For more information visit http://www.terrapinn.com/conference/stem-cells-and-regenerative-medicine-congress/index.stm. About the Arcelis® Technology Platform Arcelis® is a fully personalized immunotherapy technology that captures mutated and variant antigens that are specific to each patient's disease. It is designed to overcome immunosuppression by producing a durable memory T-cell response without adjuvants that may be associated with toxicity. The technology is potentially applicable to a wide range of different cancers, and is designed to overcome many of the manufacturing and commercialization challenges that have impeded other personalized cancer immunotherapies. The Arcelis® process uses only a small tumor or blood sample and the patient's own dendritic cells, which are optimized from cells collected by a single leukapheresis procedure. The proprietary process uses RNA isolated from the patient's disease sample to program dendritic cells to target disease specific antigens. The activated, antigen-loaded dendritic cells are then formulated into the patient's plasma and administered via intradermal injection. Argos Therapeutics is an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of fully personalized immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer using its Arcelis® technology platform. Argos' most advanced product candidate, AGS-003, is being evaluated in the pivotal ADAPT phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The Company is also developing a separate Arcelis®-based product candidate, AGS-004, for the treatment of HIV, currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial aimed at HIV eradication in adult patients.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years was the longest term length of Parliament?","output":"Title: The Longest Term Length of Parliament: The Indefatigable Stuart Era Introduction The length of a parliamentary term varies significantly between different periods, political systems, and countries. Generally, a term of parliament measures the time taken from the initial seating of a parliamentary assembly after an election to the point when the assembly is dissolved, paving the way for new elections. In this article, we will delve into the history of parliamentary systems to examine the record length of the longest term parliament and the unique circumstances that contributed to this unusually prolonged duration. The Longest Term Length of Parliament The record for the longest term length of a parliament in history goes to the English Parliament during the Stuart era, under the reign of King Charles I. This parliamentary term, which later came to be known as the \\"Long Parliament,\\" lasted for an astounding 20 years, from November 3, 1640, until April 20, 1660. Historical Context The Long Parliament's lengthy tenure can be traced back to the complex political, religious, and social factors prevalent in 17th-century England. It was a time marked by tensions between the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the emerging bourgeoisie, as well as the struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism that permeated European society. King Charles I ascended the English throne in 1625 and immediately attempted to rule without the need for Parliament. This deeply unpopular move led to several conflicts, including the Bishops' Wars (1639-1640), which ultimately forced the King to recall Parliament in 1640. However, the newly-elected Parliament, consisting mostly of Puritans and Calvinists, would go on to challenge Charles' authority and resist his autocratic tendencies. Main Events during the Long Parliament 1. Reform Agenda: The Long Parliament immediately embarked upon a reform agenda, seeking to curtail the power of the monarchy. The Parliament successfully abolished the widely despised Court of Star Chamber and the Court of High Commission. Additionally, Charles I was compelled to dissolve the Council of Wales and the North, further consolidating parliamentary authority. 2.  Grand Remonstrance: Dissatisfied with Charles I's continued interference in religious and political matters, Parliament drafted the Grand Remonstrance, a comprehensive list of grievances against the King's policies. The conflict boiled over when Charles tried to arrest five members of Parliament in 1642, marking the beginning of the English Civil War. 3. English Civil War: This brutal conflict spanned from 1642 to 1649, with the war fought between Parliamentary forces led by Oliver Cromwell and the Royalist supporters of King Charles I. The battles culminated in a victory for the Parliamentary forces, and Charles was ultimately executed in 1649. 4. The Interregnum and the Commonwealth: After the execution of Charles I, England experimented briefly with the establishment of a republic, known as the Commonwealth of England, with Cromwell as its Lord Protector. In the years that followed, the Long Parliament would establish its own interim administration and continued exercising its legislative and executive power. 5. The Restoration: With Cromwell's death in 1658 and the subsequent collapse of the Protectorate, the political landscape changed drastically. The return of the monarchy became imminent, and in 1660, General George Monck facilitated the restoration of the Stuart monarchy under Charles II. This marked the end of the Long Parliament and the beginning of the Convention Parliament, thereby concluding the two-decade-long parliamentary term. Conclusion The record-breaking 20-year term length of the Long Parliament not only stands as an unusual historical anomaly but also serves as a testament to the dramatic and tumultuous era it was a part of. The sheer longevity of this Parliament was marked by Civil War, the rise and fall of the Commonwealth, and the Restoration of the Monarchy. The Long Parliament was instrumental in shaping England's political trajectory, with its legacy effusing social, political, and religious facets of British history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Choices: + yes + it is not possible to tell + no","output":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Let's analyze both sentences to understand why: Sentence 1: Greider suggests we could replay the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. In this sentence, Greider is mentioned as making a suggestion. The suggestion is about the possibility of replaying the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. We don't know the context or reasoning behind Greider's suggestion, but the statement confirms that Greider has indeed made this suggestion. Sentence 2: One suggestion was to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. This sentence speaks about a suggestion that was made, and the suggestion is to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. The sentence does not mention Greider or any other individual, but the suggestion made is essentially the same as the one mentioned in Sentence 1. Based on the analysis of both sentences, we can see a parallelism between the content of the suggestions. If Sentence 1, which says that Greider made a particular suggestion, is true, then it logically follows that Sentence 2, which states that a suggestion was made (without specifying by whom), must also be true.

Katrina uses a delicious sauce.. II. Megan uses a delicious sauce..","output":"I. Katrina uses a delicious sauce. As the tantalizing aroma of the slowly cooking ribs wafts through the air, it becomes abundantly clear that the key to the vastly superior taste of Katrina's ribs lies in her delicious sauce. With every bite, a burst of flavors takes over, making it an unforgettable culinary experience for anyone fortunate enough to taste it. Katrina's sauce is a delectable concoction, honed to perfection after years of experimentation and adjustments. It all starts with her selection of the finest, freshest ingredients, each meticulously chosen to complement and build upon the flavor profile of the dish. Her sauce features a mix of tangy, sweet, and spicy elements crafted from a delightful blend of ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, and her secret mix of spices. This exquisite combination creates an impeccable balance that heightens the already appetizing taste of the ribs themselves. From working with several experts in the culinary world, Katrina has spent countless hours perfecting her recipe and refining her cooking techniques. By utilizing slow cooking methods, she ensures that her ribs are tender and juicy, allowing them to absorb the delectable sauce thoroughly. As a result, the ribs take on a unique, mouth-watering flavor that accentuates the succulence of the meat and the pleasantly smoky notes from the barbecue. Moreover, Katrina understands that achieving consistent quality requires systematic excellence. Each step of the cooking process – from selecting the ribs, seasoning them, and cooking them to the precise moment of doneness – is carried out with a focus on detail and unwavering dedication to the craft.  Katrina's expertise in cooking techniques doesn't end there. Her attention to detail is showcased by her mastery of the art of basting. She pays close attention to the heat of the grill, ensuring that the ribs never char and are cooked evenly. Applying her sauce at optimal intervals is also one of her secrets. This allows it to caramelize on the ribs, enveloping them in a rich, glossy finish that adds an irresistible aroma and a slightly sticky texture. On the other hand, Megan's ribs, while not unpalatable in their own right, fall short when compared to Katrina's culinary masterpieces. Megan's ribs, although tender, lack the depth of flavor and the exquisite balance that is present in Katrina's sauce. Additionally, Megan's sauce, while still appetizing, seems somewhat one-dimensional and fails to provide that same burst of tangy, sweet, and spicy delight. In conclusion, the succulent, flavorful ribs, coupled with her delicious sauce, make Katrina's cooking a clear winner over Megan's. With her unique blend of ingredients, attention to detail, and mastery of cooking techniques, Katrina elevates the humble barbecue to an unforgettable taste sensation that keeps people eagerly coming back for more."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who married and left the state altogether in 1876? is inside the article: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return., can you guess it ?

(Photo: Brennan Linsley/AP ) Vice President Biden wrapped up a Week of Action campaign on Friday, part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, at the University of Colorado in front of a packed audience, where he spoke about the need for each student to help change the culture of sexual assault. The campaign is part of the White House’s It’s On Us initiative, launched in 2014, which urges students to make a “personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault,” and which provides tools to help empower and equip students and administrations to both better understand and tackle the issue. Biden asked the crowd to raise their right hands and repeat the It’s On Us pledge, what the organization says is a “personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault.” “I pledge to recognize that non-consensual sex is sexual assault. To identify situations in which sexual assault may occur. To intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given. To create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.” Throughout his speech, Biden called on college administrators to help make their campuses safe, and focused on the need to hear from the victims themselves. “Every time you talk about it, it comes back. It comes back. It takes courage (to speak up), but they’re all saving lives,” Biden said. “Think about how many voices are on this campus that you haven’t heard but you know are there, crying silently.” Vice President Joe Biden kisses University of Colorado sophomore Emma Beach after seeing her crying after speaking about sexual violence on campus as part of the “It’s On Us” campaign April 8, 2016, at the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, Colo.

After, Biden also took time to meet students, take selfies, and even comforted one student who had broken down into tears.

Lina Alvarez’s daughter, who she has christened with the same first name, was delivered two weeks ahead of schedule by Caeserean section.      The mother-of-three, from Lugo in north-west Spain, began the menopause 20 years ago but underwent fertility treatment to have more babies.      Her pregnancy ignited a heated debate in her native country over calls to potentially cap the age limit for IVF treatment.      Lina Alvarez was told she had only a five per cent chance of giving birth to a healthy baby La Página      A series of gynecologists also said a successful pregnancy would be nigh on impossible and refused to help her.      Her healthy daughter weighed 5.2lbs.      “I’m the happiest person on the planet, everything went perfectly,” she said.      “When she is 30, I’ll be 90. She’ll have been raised and life expectancy for women is growing all the time.      “I always wanted to be a mother again but most medical experts said ‘no’.      “I feel like I’m having a second chance and the pregnancy has made me younger and stronger.”      Her eldest son, 28-year-old Exiquio, is disabled after a gynaecologist damaged his head during a routine test while she was pregnant.      Ms Alvarez had her second child, Sam, at the age of 52 after her IVF treatment.

Article:","output":"Title: Adoption Turns into Marriage for Longtime Couple in Pennsylvania Norman MacArthur and Bill Novak have spent the past 15 years as father and son, legally speaking. However, after a recent development, they'll spend the rest of their years as a married couple. After more than 50 years together, the couple got married in Pennsylvania on Sunday, according to Yahoo! Parenting. Before the ceremony, the men expressed their excitement to Patch.com, stating they were \\"ecstatic beyond belief.\\" The journey to this point, however, was far from traditional. In 2000, Novak adopted MacArthur after they moved from New York to Pennsylvania and realized their legal partnership would not be recognized in their new state. \\"The only legal avenue we had in order to be afforded any rights was adoption,\\" MacArthur explained. A lawyer referred to this \\"creative\\" strategy as \\"entirely understandable\\" and said, \\"It reflects people's deep need to protect each other as family.\\" At the time, the couple had no other choice, and this approach was considered their best option. This predicament changed this month, when a court agreed to dissolve the adoption so that MacArthur and Novak could marry. MacArthur shared his reaction with the Associated Press, saying, \\"The courtroom burst into applause. I burst into tears. They were certainly happy tears. After months of investigating ways that we could do this and finally having the decision coming down in our favor, I'm still walking 3 feet above the ground.\\" This groundbreaking case of an adoption-turned-marriage in Pennsylvania removes a significant barrier for others who may find themselves in a similar situation as MacArthur and Novak. The couple's attorney mentioned he is already representing another pair hoping to vacate their adoption in order to get married. In conclusion, the adoption-turned-marriage of Norman MacArthur and Bill Novak demonstrates how times have changed, and how the love and commitment between two individuals can eventually triumph even in the face of challenging circumstances. This case has set a precedent in Pennsylvania and may open the door for others who wish to follow in MacArthur and Novak's footsteps."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Buying pianos: a grand idea for an investment The biggest blue-chip name is Steinway – but a brand new grand can cost as much as £100,000 and loses value as soon as it leaves the showroom. The investment market focuses on the second-hand pieces, where examples of a Steinway grand typically start at about £10,000 and go up in price depending on the condition and the model. There are numerous other great makers, including the 'three Bs’ of Blüthner, Bechstein and Bösendorfer, as well as the early Steinway family offshoot Grotrian-Steinweg, plus the modern piano-maker Fazioli, that also attract investors who want a quality name but do not want to buy new. Although prices can start at under £1,000, cheaper pianos may be in need of expensive restoration. But from £2,000 upwards there is no reason why a piano with a good label cannot be purchased that will at least hold its value over time. Over the past decade, the prices of the most collectable grand pianos have doubled, thanks to an increase in demand – much of it coming from international musicians, particularly those in China. Grand pianos are the most collectable because they are the most rare and tend to offer superior acoustics – but, at 9ft in length, may not fit in your home. The so-called parlour or boudoir grand, which is typically between 5ft and 7ft long, may be more practical. However, a baby grand that is less than 5ft may not be such a shrewd investment. Reason says: “The so-called baby grand might compromise on sound. If you do not have the space or budget for a full-size grand then consider a top-quality upright piano. An upright with an overstrung iron frame can also provide better acoustics than a baby grand piano, as the strings in this instrument tend to be of greater length.” Piano Auctions holds four sales a year, with the next being on April 11 at the Conway Hall in Holborn, London. Among the top pieces being offered is a restored 9ft Steinway concert grand from the Twenties, finished in rosewood, with an estimate of £55,000. In a sale held last December, another 9ft Steinway grand made in 1925 cased in mahogany sold for £16,500. In the same sale a 1950 Steinway upright in mahogany sold for £3,400 – less than half the £7,000 estimate. Reason says: “Big price differences are due to a lot of factors – it is far more than just about the make and model. Many believe the Twenties were a heyday for piano-makers but, over time, unless the instrument has been well looked after, the piano can easily have fallen into disrepair.” In the December sale, a 9ft 2in concert grand made by Fazioli in 2007 went for £34,000, while a 6ft 3in Blüthner, also made in 2007, sold for £11,500. At the bargain end, a late-19th-century Bechstein upright valued at £1,500 sold for £200. Simon Hablin, a technician at piano restoration specialist Courtney Pianos in Oxford, says: “Condition is key. But before you throw out your old piano because it sounds out of tune, check with a specialist – not being a well-known name does not mean it can’t be valuable. It is vital for both buyers and sellers to get expert independent valuations.” Hablin explains that the passage of time – and central heating – can warp the wood and metal of many pianos. He says a basic restoration of the actions, hammers and re-felting might cost £1,500, so it can be cheaper to buy a piano with pedigree rather than fixing a relatively worthless old model. “If you want to keep a strong value you should treat it like a classic car and try to get it restored to its former glory. But an old Victorian piano can also be in better shape than a badly made modern instrument – in 100 years, the design of the piano has hardly changed,” he says. Hablin explains that the piano should be treated as an attractive piece of furniture as well as a musical instrument. The cost of a complete French polish restoration might add £2,000 to the bill, but this cost should be more than recouped in the investment appeal it can bring. Special commissioned “art case” or Art Deco pianos are particularly sought after by piano investors, with unique craftsmanship commanding a premium. “A popular modern piano is the Yamaha, but it is important to realise some cheaper models are often put together with synthetic glues and made of veneer rather than solid wood – they can be great-value instruments but cannot be renovated the same way,” adds Hablin. He warns against electronic pianos as an investment, as instruments that might have cost £2,000 new can soon plummet in value when they are overtaken by later innovations. The pianoforte - meaning “soft-loud” – was invented in 1709 by the Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori after he tinkered with a harpsichord to give it hammer volume control. Only three examples of a Cristofori survive today and these are now priceless artefacts. In the Twenties and Thirties many households had a stand-up piano as the centre of family singalongs. The piano hit its lowest note in the Sixties when many thousands were destroyed during “piano-smashing” charity events. In more recent years, the survivors have had to fight it out with modern quality pianos made by the likes of Yamaha that can provide great acoustics for reasonable prices – as well as the hi-tech electronic versions. The Yamaha is a favourite among piano teachers for its consistent good quality, and if looked after should maintain its value. Decent U1 and U3 uprights can be picked up for less than £2,000 – though you can pay more for reconditioned models. A professional piano tuner should be used to check out any potential purchase to save you from making a big mistake at auction or in a private sale. It is also good to involve the family when making any purchase. Aesthetics are important, but if you want children to enjoy the piano, let them join in the shopping. Buying a classic piano should be a fun and rewarding experience. You need to consider the cost of looking after the instrument, too. The piano should be tuned once every six months and this costs at least £50. Central heating can do permanent damage to piano wood so be wary of keeping the investment too close to a radiator, or in a room with under-floor heating. Although a piano should benefit from use – providing joy to musicians and listeners – there is no reason why it should not be seen as a beautiful piece of furniture that might appreciate in value. Provenance can also play a role in the value of a piano – especially if someone famous once owned it. Unfortunately, even the finest heritage is unlikely to improve the skills of a pianist – though the quality of the note may sound better. You will still have to keep taking those piano lessons. Five famous pianos that have soared in value A 1970 Steinway 'Model Z’ upright used by John Lennon to compose Imagine in 1971 was sold at auction for £1.67 million – £1.45 million plus commission – to George Michael in October 2000. The former Beatle also recorded the single on this piano. A piano used by the actor Dooley Wilson as Sam in the 1942 movie Casablanca sold for £370,000 at a Sotheby’s auction in December 2012. Humphrey Bogart – who played Rick – actually said: 'Play it, Sam’, referring to As Time Goes By, and not: 'Play it again, Sam.’ The piano was a Warner Brothers prop with 58 keys – 30 less than on a conventional instrument. A piano used by Paul McCartney for the first rendition of Yesterday sold for £150,000 in April 2011. The 1926 green Eavestaff mini-piano was owned by a friend, the singer Alma Cogan. The Beatle had dreamt of the melody the previous night while in bed and went round to her house in 1964, fearing it might have been an existing melody. A white 1910 “A-Day Birdcage” upright, used by Elton John in the early Seventies to compose in collaboration with Bernie Taupin, sold at auction for £91,000 in 2004. He used it to play classic pieces such as Your Song.

A brand called Steinway is really popular, but brand new pianos can be very pricey. Instead, people look at second-hand pianos that are a bit cheaper.  Over the years, the prices of some old grand pianos have gone up a lot because people really want them. These grand pianos look and sound really nice, but they are very big, so they might not fit in someone's house.  When you want to buy a piano, it is important to check if it is in good condition. Sometimes old pianos can be worth fixing up if they have a good brand name, but other times it is better to buy a newer one instead. A piano can be a great piece of furniture as well as a musical instrument, and taking good care of it can help it keep its value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Battle of Culloden, in 1746, was fought close to which Scottish city????","output":"To find the answer, I will search for information regarding the Battle of Culloden and identify the closest Scottish city to the battle location. Step 1: Find information about the Battle of Culloden. The Battle of Culloden was the final confrontation of the Jacobite Rising of 1745, which was an attempt to restore the House of Stuart to the British throne. It took place on April 16, 1746, and was a decisive victory for the British government forces against the Jacobite rebels. Step 2: Identify the location of the Battle of Culloden. The battle was fought near Culloden Moor, which is in the Scottish Highlands.  Step 3: Determine the closest major Scottish city to Culloden Moor. Culloden Moor is located around 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of Inverness, which is the largest city in the Highlands of Scotland.  Based on this information, the Battle of Culloden, in 1746, was fought close to the Scottish city of Inverness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground. Who bit Ranur?

At 9:48, a representative from the White House shelter asked if there were any indications of another hijacked aircraft. The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon.  After reading the above, is \\"64 minutes\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How long from the time that the president was told a second plane hit the second tower, did it take for air sovereignty aircraft to be directed to battle stations\\"?","output":"First, we need to determine the exact time the President was told about the second plane hitting the second tower, and then find out the time when the air sovereignty aircraft were directed to battle stations. From the text: - At 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to the President: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" - At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. Now, we can calculate the time difference to find out how long it took: 9:49 (time air sovereignty aircraft directed to battle stations) - 9:05 (time President was told about the second plane) = 44 minutes So, the correct answer to the question \\"How long from the time that the president was told a second plane hit the second tower, did it take for air sovereignty aircraft to be directed to battle stations?\\" is 44 minutes, not 64 minutes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

(Evasive Beats) is a story set in the near future where technology has advanced far beyond what people once thought possible. The protagonist, E.B., short for Evasive Beats, is a skilled martial artist and undercover operative who has been implanted with an intuitive AI system that gives them great combat capabilities, including the ability to predict the movement of enemies and dodge attacks with incredible precision. The film starts with E.B., a highly trained operative, being assigned to a covert mission to infiltrate and dismantle a dangerous and powerful criminal organization, known as The Blades. This organization has recently acquired a mass production facility for advanced weaponry, threatening global peace and stability. The weapons of choice for The Blades are life-threatening, intelligent, and self-guided blades that inflict brutal damage on their victims. E.B.'s main task is to locate the factory, bring down its operations, and capture the leader of The Blades, Victor Helix, an infamous figure in the criminal underworld. Joined by a highly skilled team of agents, E.B. embarks on a treacherous journey through a dystopian city filled with incredibly skilled adversaries and deadly traps. Throughout the film, E.B. faces numerous deadly encounters with members of The Blades and its array of lethal machines, including battles with the powerful and highly skilled henchmen of Victor Helix. In these high-octane scenes, E.B. relies on the evasive beats - the predictive AI system implanted within them - to avoid the lethal attacks of The Blades. But the plot takes a twist when E.B. discovers that Victor Helix has anticipated their arrival and is tracking E.B.'s every move, including the team's extraction plans. Now trapped in the city, E.B. and the team not only have to face Victor's henchmen but must also dodge city surveillance and military police forces sent to eliminate them. As the story unfolds, E.B. slowly learns that the intuitive AI system within them not only helps them evade their enemies but also lays down some hidden talents that they had not previously known - such as an ability to connect with and manipulate cutting-edge technology. Relying on this newfound power, E.B. takes on a daring and seemingly impossible plan to take down the entire organization. Along with the help of his team, E.B. successfully infiltrates the factory, shutting down the production line, and ultimately confronts Victor Helix in a climactic showdown combining martial arts combat, state-of-the-art weapons, and lightning-fast dodging skills. The movie concludes as E.B., using their predictive AI implant's incredible power, narrowly dodges the leader's final attack before delivering the decisive blow, effectively dismantling The Blades and ensuring global peace. Throughout the film, E.B. demonstrates their incredible survival skills and tenacity, giving audiences an adrenaline-pumping ride filled with action, suspense, and cutting-edge technology all built around the central question: How does E.B. survive dodging the blades?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Question: \\"Is the Iranian government for or against women activists?\\" Response: \\"Against\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. The passage discusses the Iranian government's strategy against the women's movement and its targeting of women activists, which indicates that the Iranian government is against women activists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus.\\" if \\"the person is sleeping\\"?","output":"Analyzing the task, we can see it involves integrating two different pieces of information and assessing whether they can coexist. The first piece of information is: \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus.\\" The second piece of information is: \\"The person is sleeping.\\" Now let's look at these two statements together, step-by-step: 1. The first statement: It describes a person with long hair, located on the top level of a double-decker bus, actively doing something: they are staring out of the window. This implies that the person is conscious and awake to be able to perform these activities. 2. The second statement: It simply states that the person is sleeping. Sleeping is a state of unconsciousness where the person is not aware of their surroundings and therefore, most likely, not capable of performing any conscious activity like the aforementioned staring out of the window.  Considering these two points, it seems the two statements are logically inconsistent. However, one possible interpretation could be that the first statement described the person before they fell asleep, and the second statement describes them afterwards. But without this context, we cannot assume that is the case. In conclusion, based on the given information, it's not possible to conclude that \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus\\" if \\"the person is sleeping\\", as these two things cannot occur simultaneously under normal circumstances. The states of being awake and sleeping are mutually exclusive, and staring out of the window requires the person to be awake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Question: \\"Why was Shiva Nazar Ahari put in prison?\\" Answer: \\"Alleged adultery\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct:  (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"(1). no; The paragraph states that Shiva Nazar Ahari was put in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God.\\" This catch-all offense is used for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions.

Summarize the following: This is one of the more difficult repairs to attempt yourself, so make sure that you can't fix the issue using one of the other methods in this article first. If you've tried everything, you can try replacing your hard drive as a last-ditch effort.   If you iPod is making a clicking sound and the \\"sad iPod\\" image appears on your screen, then the hard drive most likely needs to be replaced. Replacement hard drives can be ordered online, or you can scavenge a drive out of another iPod that is the same model. All versions of the iPod Touch, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Nano use flash memory instead of a traditional hard drive. This means there are no moving parts that can fail or connections that can become severed. There is no practical way to secure or replace an iPod Touch hard drive, as the flash memory unit is built into the circuitry. Make sure that the iPod is turned off and locked with the Hold switch toggled on before opening your iPod. This will ensure that you don't accidentally turn it on while working on it. Follow the steps in the previous method to remove the back from your iPod to expose the hard drive. Lift the hard drive from the top of the iPod. Don't try to pull it out completely. Remove the rubber bumpers and shock absorber and set them to the side. You will see a cable at the bottom the drive that attaches the drive to the circuitry. Gently work the cable out of the drive, using either your fingers or a screwdriver. Once the cable has been detached, you should be able to completely remove the drive from the housing. Once you have pulled the drive out, take off the foam cover and put it on your replacement drive. Put the rubber shock absorbers on it as well. Insert the new drive in the same direction that the old drive was installed. Gently insert the cable so that the hard drive can send and receive data from the iPod's motherboard. Close up the iPod and ensure that all of the tabs click. With the new hard drive installed, all that is left is to perform a restore on the iPod.

Justin didn't have the strength to lift the bricks unlike Kevin because","output":"Justin had always been a bit of a scrawny kid. Where Kevin was muscular and confident, Justin was slim and shy. This made it difficult for Justin to compete against his brother, Kevin, when it came to physical tasks. Growing up together, the two had always been compared by their parents, teachers, and friends. Justin couldn't help but feel inadequate in the shadow of his determined and strong brother. However, as they got older, their differences took them along separate paths in life. Kevin went on to become a star athlete in their small town, his well-toned physique earning him praise and attention from everyone, whether on the football field or the local construction site. His natural ability to perform physically demanding tasks landed him a job with the prominent local construction company. Everyone agreed that Kevin was truly a force to be reckoned with. Meanwhile, what Justin lacked in physical strength, he made up for in his creativity and intellect. Passionate about science and engineering, he delved deep into his studies, earning top grades and recognition from his professors. Though Justin was well-aware of his physical limitations, he channeled his energy into inventing devices and gadgets that would give him the opportunity to keep up with his brother. Justin's devices were as awe-inspiring as they were ingenious – from the robotic exoskeleton that allowed him to assist on construction sites to the remote-controlled drones that he used to help rescue trapped workers in collapsed buildings. Still, whenever he was around Kevin, Justin couldn't escape that nagging feeling that he was the lesser sibling, somehow inferior in the eyes of others. One day, as Justin was walking home from school, he stumbled across a group of kids who were struggling to build a makeshift fort out of bricks in a nearby alley. He watched in fascination as the children strained to lift the heavy stones in their small arms but couldn't budge them. Justin spotted Kevin driving past in his truck. The temptation was too great to resist. He had to find a way to construct a stronger and more efficient device that would allow him to demonstrate his own capabilities, particularly in front of his brother. As Justin hurried home, an idea struck him. What if he could devise a kinetic power enhancer that would harness and amplify his own limited strength? This way, he could lift the bricks with ease and help the kids complete their fort. Over the following weeks, Justin toiled away in his makeshift workshop, feverishly working on the blueprint for his new invention. Chronicling every gear, lever, and switch, he spent hours tinkering and building his power-enhancing masterpiece. The day finally arrived, and Justin proudly unveiled his KinetiX-3000, to the amazement of the children gathered around. As he strapped the device to his arms and legs, he could feel the surge of newfound power coursing through him. Justin marveled in delight as he effortlessly lifted a brick and then another, each seemingly weightless in his hands. It was undeniably impressive, a testament to his ingenuity and determination. As he built the children's fort, word began to spread, and the crowd grew. Even Kevin, who was driving by again, stopped to see what all the commotion was about. The sight of his little brother handling bricks with super-human strength surprised him, but it also filled Kevin with profound respect for Justin. Kevin told his brother, now more than impressed, \\"You may not have the muscles, but you've got something much stronger: your brain.\\" Justin understood that what made him different from Kevin didn't have to be a burden, but what truly defined him and contributed to their community. Lifting bricks might have been a small act, but it was a monumental victory for both brothers – a moment of realization that strength comes in many forms, and each person's unique abilities can be celebrated. From that day on, Justin and Kevin no longer compared themselves to each other. Instead, they embraced each other's strengths, working together as siblings and supporting one another in their common goal of improving the lives of the people in their town. The brothers had finally formed an unbreakable bond, built not on bricks, but on love, respect, and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Coagulopathy ( also called a clotting disorder ) is a condition in which the blood 's ability to coagulate ( form clots ) is impaired . This condition can cause a tendency toward prolonged or excessive bleeding ( bleeding diathesis or bleeding disorder ) , which may occur spontaneously or following an injury or medical and dental procedures .  - In medicine (hematology), bleeding diathesis (h(a)emorrhagic diathesis) is an unusual susceptibility to bleed (hemorrhage) mostly due to hypocoagulability, in turn caused by a coagulopathy (a defect in the system of coagulation). Several types are distinguished, ranging from mild to lethal. Also, bleeding diathesis can be caused by thinning of the skin or impaired wound healing.  - Hematology, also spelled haematology (from the Greek , \\"haima\\" \\"blood,\\" and -o), is the branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. Hematology includes the study of etiology. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots, other bleeding disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. Many hematologists work as hematologist-oncologists, also providing medical treatment for all types of cancer.   - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.    What object entity has the relation of 'medical specialty' with the subject 'coagulopathy'?

Waxes can also be purchased in different holding strengths: light/medium, medium, strong, or extra strong. Consider three other factors when choosing your wax. Options 1 and 4 remind you to look at the length of your mustache (like short or long), and how strong you need the wax to hold it (like weak or very strong), which are good tips for choosing mustache wax.  Option 2, about choosing wax made from plants, might be confusing because not all plant-based waxes are good for your mustache. Also, it's not clear what \\"unknown plants and sources\\" means or why such waxes shouldn't be considered mustache wax at all. Option 3 is saying some waxes made from fake stuff (synthetic products) aren't as good as caseins and salt (stuff in the food). But, it doesn't make sense to compare to caseins and salt because those are not typical ingredients for mustache wax. Also, any wax being called 'oil' and not meant for the face is confusing because we're talking about waxes, not oil. Also, 'oil' waxes could be okay if they're meant for facial hair like mustache or beard oil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who picked which version of the text to reprint? is inside the article: The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\".  The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes.  Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\".   Boydell spared no expense.  He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition.  Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon.  answer the following question:  What percentage of the Rogue River is Wild and Scenic?

In this case, the review only has two words: \\"Like it.\\" It does indicate that the reviewer has positive feelings towards the subject, but it doesn't provide much context or explanation. Step 2: Consider the scope of the review. Short reviews can sometimes be impactful and concise, but in this case, the use of only two words does not provide much information about the reasons behind the reviewer's liking or specific aspects they enjoyed. Step 3: Assess potential biases or lack of objectivity. Since the review is very short and doesn't provide much context, it is hard to ascertain any potential bias or objectivity. Step 4: Factor in writing style and grammar. The review is written in a simple way with no clear grammatical errors or problems with punctuation. However, it also lacks any descriptive language or variety. After considering these steps, I would rate this review as a 2 out of 5.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from:  (a). no  (b). yes","output":"In order to determine if KFC is halal, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Research KFC's food practices I will research KFC's food practices to understand whether they follow halal guidelines. This includes the sourcing of their chicken, the method of slaughtering and preparing the meat, and overall hygiene and cleanliness. Step 2: Explore regional differences Different countries may have varying halal standards and KFC restaurants may adapt to comply with local regulations. I will check if KFC meets the halal standards in various regions. Step 3: Check for certification I will check if KFC has any halal certification to confirm whether their chicken is halal or not. Halal certifying bodies can provide assurance that KFC follows the necessary guidelines. After conducting research, it is found that KFC is halal in some countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, where the company operates halal-certified branches. However, in other countries or regions, KFC may not necessarily be halal. It is important to check local KFC branches and their certification to confirm whether KFC's chicken is halal or not in a specific area. Now, let's analyze the two questions: 1. Is KFC Halal? 2. Is KFC chicken halal? Both questions ask whether KFC complies with halal rules, although the second question specifically focuses on the chicken itself. It can be assumed that if the chicken is halal, then the overall restaurant will be considered halal, given that chicken is their primary product. As both questions are aiming to determine the halal status of KFC, particularly its chicken, the questions can be considered the same.

The term \\"head\\" suggests that the palace is at the starting point or entrance of the avenue, rather than being situated at a distance from it. Durbar Marg Avenue likely stretches southwards from the palace, with the palace serving as a prominent landmark or focal point at its northern end. The actual distance between the palace and various locations along Durbar Marg Avenue may vary, but it would be incorrect to assume that palace is far from the avenue as the entire avenue starts from the palace itself.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. According to the above context, answer the following question. When did the cab driver have enough money to only work 1 job?","output":"The cab driver had enough money to only work 1 job when she won a small jackpot a few years back. This allowed her to cut back to one job for a few months. Therefore, she had enough money when she won the jackpot because it reduced her need for multiple jobs. It is also implied that after this period when she only had to work one job ended, she was forced to return to working multiple jobs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do that, we will subtract 98*h from both sides: 218*h - 98*h - 2880 = 0 Now, let's simplify that: (218 - 98) * h - 2880 = 0 120 * h - 2880 = 0 Next, we want to isolate h, so let's add 2880 to both sides: 120 * h = 2880 Now, to find the value of h, we'll just divide by 120: h = 2880 / 120 And after we divide, we'll find our answer: h = 24 So, the value of h is 24!

(Associated Press)      Police detain a protester in downtown Moscow, Russia, Sunday, May 26, 2017. Russia's leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny and his supporters aim to hold anti-corruption demonstrations throughout Russia. But authorities are denying permission and police have warned they won't be responsible for \\"negative... (Associated Press)      MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of people crowded into Moscow's Pushkin Square on Sunday for an unsanctioned protest against the Russian government, the biggest gathering in a wave of nationwide protests that were the most extensive show of defiance in years.      Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner who is leading the opposition to President Vladimir Putin, was arrested while walking from a nearby subway station to the demonstration at Moscow's iconic Pushkin Square.      Navalny and his Foundation for Fighting Corruption had called for the protests, which attracted hundreds or thousands in most sizeable Russian cities, from the Far East port of Vladivostok to the European heartland including St. Petersburg.      The protests were the largest coordinated outpourings of dissatisfaction in Russia since the massive 2011-12 demonstrations that followed a fraud-tainted parliamentary election.      Police estimated the Moscow crowd at about 7,000, but it could have been larger. The one-hectare (2.5-acre) Pushkin Square was densely crowded as were sidewalks on the adjacent Tverskaya Street.      State news agency Tass cited Moscow police as saying about 200 people were arrested.      Russia's beleaguered opposition is often seen as primarily a phenomenon of a Westernized urban elite, but Sunday's protests included gatherings in places far from cosmopolitan centers, such as Siberia's Chita and Barnaul.      \\"Navalny has united people who think the same; that people don't agree with the authorities is obvious from what is going on in the country today,\\" Anna Ivanova, 19, said at the Moscow demonstration. \\"I am a bit scared.\\"      Scuffles with police erupted sporadically and the arrested demonstrators included a gray-haired man whom police dragged along the pavement. Police cleared the square after about three hours and began herding demonstrators down side streets.      \\"It's scary, but if everyone is afraid, no one would come out onto the streets,\\" Yana Aksyonova, 19, said.      The protests Sunday focused on reports by Navalny's group claiming that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has amassed a collection of mansions, yachts and vineyards. The alleged luxuries include a house for raising ducks, so many placards in Sunday's protests featured mocking images of yellow duck toys.      \\"People are unhappy with the fact that there's been no investigation\\" of the corruption allegations, said Moscow protester Ivan Gronstein.      In the Pacific port city of Vladivostok, police forcefully detained some demonstrators near the city's railway terminal, in one case falling down a small grassy slope as they wrestled with a detainee.      News reports and social media reported demonstrations in large cities throughout the country, including Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. At least 25 people were reported arrested in Vladivostok and 12 in Khabarovsk.      Some demonstrators showed up with their faces painted green, a reference to a recent attack on Navalny in which an assailant threw a green antiseptic liquid onto his face. ||||| Moscow (CNN) Hundreds of people, including a prominent opposition figure, were arrested in Moscow Sunday for participating in unauthorized protests, according to state media and a human rights group.      The demonstrators were attending a large-scale anti-corruption demonstration in Moscow.      State-run news outlet Tass reported that 8,000 people attended the protest in Moscow alone. Similar protests were planned in 100 cities across Russia, according to organizers.      Opposition supporters take part in an unauthorized anti-corruption rally in central Moscow on Sunday.      Russian human rights group OVD-Info tweeted that more than 700 had been detained in Moscow -- while state-run news agency Ria Novosti said 500 had been held.      Among those detained was Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, according to tweets by Navalny and his press secretary.      \\"Today we are discussing (and condemning) corruption, not the detentions. Well, I was detained. So what. It OK. There are things in life that are worth being detained for,\\" Navalny tweeted.      The demonstrations come at a time when the safety of critics of Vladimir Putin is under scrutiny. On Thursday, a former Russian lawmaker and vocal critic of the Russian government, Denis Voronenkov, was shot dead outside a luxury hotel in the Ukrainian capital Kiev.      Navalny has not commented on the killing. CNN has contacted him for comment.      JUST WATCHED Chilling video shows Kremlin critic's death Replay More Videos ...

The protest drew a heavy police presence but remained largely peaceful. Riot officers flanked crowds while plainclothes officers moved among the demonstrators. Police told those on the street that the protest was unsanctioned and asked them to move on.      Navalny praised turnouts for the protests in early morning tweets. \\"Far East started fine,\\" he tweeted, referring to a photo of protesters gathering in the city of Vladivostok, located on Russia's far eastern coast. Navalny also shared photos and tweets from various parts of the country.      Opposition supporters participate in an anti-corruption rally in central St. Petersburg on March 26, 2017.      'He is not your Dimon'      The protests are part of a campaign called \\"He is not your Dimon,\\" which uses the diminutive form of the Russian name Dmitry to refer to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.      Navalny has accused Medvedev of amassing a global property empire through various forms of corruption.      In a report published on March 2, Navalny said Medvedev has a portfolio of assets including \\"huge pieces of land in the most sought-after regions, yachts, apartments in old mansions, agricultural complexes and wineries in Russia and abroad.\\" Navalny's report claims this was all purchased through \\"bribes from oligarchs, and state bank loans.\\"      Police officers detain a man during an unauthorized anti-corruption rally in central Moscow on March 26.      Medvedev's spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told state-run news agency RIA Novosti, \\"It is pointless to comment on the propagandistic outbursts of a convicted opposition figure, who has already announced he is running some kind of election campaign and fighting against the authorities.\\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the report \\"not the first creative effort from this well-known convicted citizen,\\" according to Tass.      Moscow protest in sight of Kremlin      Protesters in Moscow walked along Tverskaya Street, one of the city's main arteries that starts at the Kremlin walls. \\"I can't support our government, really,\\" one protester said. \\"They steal our money using their power.\\"      The Moscow Police Department put out a statement Thursday urging people not to attend, calling it illegal and warning of a high risk of \\"provocative acts, designed to violate public order.\\" Police said the organizers of the event were offered an alternative location but declined. The Kremlin said Friday the event was \\"illegal\\" and a \\"provocation.\\"      Navalny, who rose to prominence during the large-scale anti-government protests in Russia in 2011, has announced he plans to run for the Russian presidency in 2018.      In February, he was found guilty of embezzlement in a retrial of a case that dates back to 2013. Russian law prevents convicted criminals running for public office, but Navalny has appealed the verdict. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"On 26 May 2017, thousands of people gathered in Moscow's Pushkin Square and other major Russian cities in a wave of anti-government demonstrations, the largest in years.

The Italian believes Van Gaal will succeed at Old Trafford but thinks it may take time. VIDEO Scroll down for Cristiano Ronaldo enjoys rub-down from Real Madrid physio... a lot! Out: Cristiano Ronaldo won't play against Manchester United after Carlo Ancelotti admitted his star man isn't fit. Pity: The Portugal international won't be able to face his old side when they play in Michigan on Saturday. Doing battle: New United boss Louis van Gaal will face a stern test against Carlo Ancelotti's Real. 'He is a very good and very experience manager, he has fantastic experience and he will do a fantastic job at United,' said Ancelotti at a press conference ahead of Real training. 'He is a manager who has nothing to learn. After Sir Alex Ferguson, it was more difficult for United, but they now have to rebuild a team. 'They have signed good players, but building a team is not easy and the Premier League is a very competitive league. 'It will not be easy to win in the first year because there are many competitive teams who want to win. 'It is not easy to implement a new system. It is important that the player is convinced, but it is difficult to say how long it will take.' Ancelotti won the Premier League title with Chelsea in his first season in 2009/10 and led Real to the Champions League crown last season. He was on United’s short-list to replace David Moyes after Ferguson’s successor was sacked last April. Asked about this on Friday, he said: 'These are rumours that usually happen, but I am at a fantastic club. 'I have lots of respect for United, but I am happy here and I think they have made a good chance in Louis van Gaal.' Injury problems: Ronaldo will not face his former employers on Saturday for Real Madrid. Ronaldo has joined up with Real here in Michigan but will not play against his old club on Saturday. Ancelotti said: 'He has been working individually, separate from the team, but he will not play tomorrow and will train when back at Madrid because we will use him in the Super Cup. 'The plan for Cristiano was right. We gave him one month of rest and started back on July 26, but he needs to recover completely and for this reason we don’t want to take a risk tomorrow. Disappointing: Ronaldo will be gutted at the news he will miss this Saturday's game against his former side. 'It’s never a friendly against Man Utd. It is a fantastic team in a fantastic stadium, but it is the last game of our tour and we want to finish well. 'We need to play a good game tomorrow because we play a fantastic team. 'I am not surprised by the crowd. The people here have a fantastic culture, they support our team and soccer is improving really quickly in the USA.' During his press conference, Ancelotti was informed by English reporters that his former Chelsea midfielder was about to join Manchester City on loan. He said: 'I didn’t know this. I’m really surprised because I thought he was coming here to play in USA to play. 'It’s too late for me to take him to Madrid but I’m really happy for Frank as I have a good memory of him.

Italy's top court just struck down a law shielding Berlusconi from prosecution.","output":"Title: Italy's Prime Minister Battling Accusations of Illicit Relations with Teen Dancer Introduction: In a recent scandal that's taking Italy by storm, the nation's Prime Minister is facing allegations of having engaged in sexual relations with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer. The Prime Minister has dismissed these allegations, citing that his opponents have taken things too far in their pursuits against him.  Step 1: Present the accusations The controversy began when Italy's Prime Minister was accused of engaging in sexual relations with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer. As a leader of the nation, such allegations have raised questions about his integrity and have put his leadership under the microscope. Step 2: Describe the Prime Minister's response In response to these allegations, the Prime Minister has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, stating that his opponents were merely attempting to discredit him by going too far in their attacks. He asserts that not only are these accusations baseless, but they are also a reflection of political maneuvering by those wishing to topple his administration. Step 3: Include the woman's reaction and statement In addition to the Prime Minister's dismissal of the allegations, the woman in question, who has not been named thus far, has also come forward stating that she has never engaged in a sexual relationship with the Prime Minister. Speaking to an Italian TV station, she made it clear that the accusations were not based on any factual information. Step 4: Discuss the recent legal developments Complicating matters further, Italy's top court has recently struck down a law that had previously protected Berlusconi from prosecution. This ruling now paves the way for potential legal consequences if the Prime Minister is ever found to be guilty of the allegations being brought against him.

It incorporates great action with an intense love story. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette have amazing chemistry. Brad Pitt delivers one of his finest roles in a cameo as a drugged out, but friendly guy (check out the honey container he offers Christopher Walken, in one of the most awkward but funniest scenes I've seen). Worth seeing over and over again as well for Val Kilmer's cameo as Elvis, who guides Christian Slater and gives him courage throughout the movie. Dennis Hopper also delivers a poignant and sweet performance as Christian Slater's somewhat estranged but loving father. Don't miss this one!!!!

I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \\"I will.\\" She said, \\"I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home.\\" \\"Yes,\\" I said, \\"Do that,\\" and did not care what she did, or why. Emil asked, \\"You're all right?\\" I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent.

Hint: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert?  Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his...

Write a title for this article: Returning to work after maternity leave is a huge stressor for many first time moms, not only because of the logistical hoops you have to jump through to re-arrange your work life around your new baby, but it can also fill women with self-doubt about their roles as career woman and mom. It also seems to come way too quickly. Some experts believe that women need about four months of maternity leave before they’re ready to come back, but many women only get six to eight weeks. Here’s how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Performing at Work • Ease the transition. Experts recommend starting in the middle of the week, so your first work week is short. It is also becoming more common for women to arrange to work one or two days the first week or so, or come in for a shorter day for the first two or three days to help ease the transition. The smoother your transition, the more productive you’ll be at work, says Chris Essex, director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville, Md. • Tone down the baby talk—or not! A lot of women fear if they talk about their babies at work, people will assume they wish they were home instead of working. “Yet talking about your baby can build connections to people in the workplace,” says Jamie Ladge, assistant professor in management at Northeastern University in Boston. “People talk about their personal lives all the time at work, so it’s natural to talk about your kids.\\" But use your judgment. If you intuit that your co-workers won’t be receptive or can’t relate, then keep the cute baby stories to a minimum. • Give yourself time to adjust. Don’t think you need to reconsider your options if your first few weeks back are rocky. “When women come back to work, they’re in a lot of flux, trying to integrate how they are as a professional with their new role as a mother,” Ladge says. It may take some time to adjust to your new identity and learn how to juggle work and home responsibilities. • Ask for flex time. More and more women and men are negotiating schedules that are less rigid and can ease the stresses with working 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. “You may fear that people will think less of you if you ask, but if you don’t ask, you don’t get,” Ladge says. Talk to other employees who may have been down the same road to see what type of arrangements they have. • Ignore the comments. People can say overtly or covertly stereotypical things, which can fill you with self doubt. A seasoned mother might say, “I cried and cried when I came back to work,” making you question what kind of mom you are since you didn’t shed a tear. A boss might say, “I hope you’re not one of those women who aren’t 100 percent committed now that you have a baby.” Just laugh it off. And don’t work twice as hard to prove them wrong. • Be clear with your supervisors. Be communicative about what you want from your job and what your ambitions are so that you don’t get sidelined for promotions because of inaccurate assumptions about you now that you’re a mom. Juggling • You’ll be exhausted. If there’s a time you could use the support of your parents or some extra paid help, it is when you’re transitioning back to work. If you can get some help with cleaning and cooking during this time, it can help you feel less frazzled. • Plan the morning routine. One of the most critical issues is the division of labor between you and your spouse. Who will take showers when, who will watch the baby, feed the baby, and get the baby to child care. Ditto for dinnertime and pickup. “You and your spouse need to work it out in advance because it’s hard to negotiate when you’re tired or in the middle of a hectic schedule,” Essex says. • Alternate nighttime feedings. If you handle all the middle-of-the night feedings, you’ll be exhausted in the morning. Try to alternate nights with your husband. • Don’t try to be super-mom. Understand that you may not be able to do everything like you used to. Some things may fall by the wayside, like a perfectly clean house, or home-cooked dinners every night. Missing Your Baby • Get acclimated to child care. Test drive your child care for at least three days before going back to work to give you and your baby time to adjust. That can lower your anxiety level about your child’s transition. “Having good child care that makes you feel confident is key and reminding yourself that your baby is safe and loved will really help,” says Murphy Daly, author of The Pregnant Professional. • Do a dress rehearsal. Prior to the first day back, get all the stuff ready, have the feeding and napping things packed and ready to go,” Daly says. “Take baby to childcare and then go get your personal grooming done while you practice being away.\\" • Check in with your child care once a day. For some people, checking in may make it harder, so tailor the advice to what works for you. Some women like to have pictures of the baby at work, while for others, it may make the transition more difficult. • Don’t be surprised to miss your baby. Try not to assume that something is wrong with your work ethic for wanting to be home with your baby rather than working. Women often feel pulled in both directions, so it’s more about getting used to wanting to be in both places at once. • Think about a breastfeeding plan. If you are breastfeeding, you should start pumping and freezing milk about a month before you go back to work. Make sure you have a private place to pump at work.

When you can't find Meyer lemons, the best alternative is to use a combination of regular lemons and oranges. Meyer lemons have a sweeter taste compared to regular lemons, and the mixture of orange (which is sweet) and lemon (which is sour) will give you a similar flavor to Meyer lemons. Using half a pomegranate and half an orange doesn't make sense because pomegranates have a completely different taste and texture compared to Meyer lemons.

Please answer the following question: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more.  It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace?  A. More calories will be burned  B. So there is more time in the day to exercise, since you will be done with chores faster  C. Stretching your arms will make you more flexible  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. More calories will be burned"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write a sentence about the following things: hold, pier, span","output":"Step 1: Since the user wants a sentence containing the words 'hold,' 'pier,' and 'span', I will first consider the definitions of these words as they may have multiple meanings. : - Hold (verb): To carry or support (possibly a structure or load), maintain a position, grip, or contain. - Pier (noun): A raised structure over water, usually supported by strong pillars, to provide access to boats or ships; or a vertical support for loads (such as a bridge). - Span (noun): The extent or distance between two points, such as the length of a bridge or a section of a structure. Step 2: I'll now think about a possible scenario or context where I can use these words coherently in a sentence, taking into account their meanings. Considering the context of structures, a possible scenario could involve a bridge built on a pier that has to hold a certain amount of weight, with the span referring to the distance the bridge covers. Step 3: Having determined the context, I'll proceed to drafting the sentence. \\"The pier-built bridge was designed to hold a significant load of weight, stretching across an impressive span from one shore to the other.\\" In this sentence, I faithfully incorporated all three words - 'hold,' 'pier,' and 'span' - in a context where their meanings make sense and create a coherent statement."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sentence 1: but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground Sentence 2: I've always had raised flower garden beds. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the sentences convey contrasting ideas. Let's analyze both sentences to understand their meanings and see why they are not related in the manner suggested. Sentence 1: \\"But I, yeah, I do want to have a raised bed. I've never... my flower gardens have always been like on the ground.\\" This sentence shows that the speaker wants to have a raised bed for their flower garden, but they have never had one before. The speaker's flower gardens have traditionally been on the ground, not raised. This implies that the speaker has experience with ground-level gardening and is now expressing interest in trying raised-bed gardening. Sentence 2: \\"I've always had raised flower garden beds.\\" The second sentence straightforwardly states that the speaker has consistently had raised garden beds. By saying \\"I've always had,\\" the speaker is asserting that in all their gardening experiences, they have used raised beds. In summary, the first sentence illustrates a desire to change from ground-level gardening to raised bed gardening, while the second sentence suggests that the speaker already has a long-standing history with raised-bed gardening. Consequently, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they express opposing perspectives on the speaker's engagement with raised garden beds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Star Search is an American television show that was produced T.P.E./Rysher Entertainment from 1983 to 1995, hosted by Ed McMahon, and created by Alfred Masini. A relaunch was produced by 2929 Productions from 2003 to 2004. On both versions of the show, contestants competed in several genres of entertainment. The show was originally filmed at the old Earl Carroll Theatre (now known as Nickelodeon on Sunset), at 6230 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and later at the Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida.  - A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.  - Pharrell Lanscilo Williams (born April 5, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer, and film producer.  - NSYNC (sometimes stylized as NSYNC or 'N Sync) was an American boy band formed in Orlando, Florida in 1995 and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola Munich. NSYNC consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, \\"No Strings Attached\\", sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan.  - The Neptunes are an American production duo, composed of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, who are credited with contributing the sound for many successful hip hop and R&B artists in the late-1990s and 2000s. The Neptunes' sound is a distinctive brand of off-kilter, stripped-down electronic funk with sounds from Middle Eastern and Asian music including percussion and woodwind. Pharrell sings and (later) raps on records and appears in videos, unlike his production partner Chad, who tends to stay behind the scenes.  - \\"Rock Your Body\\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake for his debut studio album, \\"Justified\\" (2002). It was written by Timberlake along with The Neptunes (consisting of Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams), who also produced the track. The song was released on April 7, 2003 by Jive Records as the third single from \\"Justified\\". The track is an uptempo, disco groove, soul infused song containing influences from Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. The female section of the track is sung by Vanessa Marquez. Originally intended to be featured on Jackson's tenth studio album \\"Invincible\\" (2001), the latter rejected the song along with several other tracks, which were instead given to Timberlake for his debut album.  - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures).  - \`\` I 'm Lovin ' It '' is a song recorded by American singer - songwriter Justin Timberlake . It was written by Pharrell Williams , Tom Batoy , Andreas Forberger and Franco Tortora and produced by The Neptunes .

Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows \\"Star Search\\" and \\"The All-New Mickey Mouse Club\\" as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. During their hiatus, Timberlake released his debut solo album, the R&B-focused \\"Justified\\" (2002), which yielded the successful singles \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Rock Your Body\\", and earned his first two Grammy Awards.  - Charles Edward \\"Chad\\" Hugo (born February 24, 1974) is an American multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is best known as one half of the music production and writing duo The Neptunes and as a member of N.E.R.D. He is a saxophonist, pianist and guitarist.

Q:Process:  - Particles in the environment interact with rocks - The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces -   suppose bigger particles hitting the rock happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"When bigger particles hit the rock, it affects the erosion of rocks in both a direct and indirect manner. Let's analyze how this perturbation impacts the given process step by step. 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: When bigger particles interact with rocks, they directly impact the erosion process by causing more significant abrasion or fragmentation. The removal of small pieces of rock each time bigger particles touch the rocks results in more substantial chunks being broken off, leading to a quicker overall deterioration. During these interactions, the energy and mass of larger particles can cause higher stress on the rock, leading to quicker fragmentation and disintegration of the rock structure. As a result, bigger particles accelerate the erosion process by removing more substantial parts of the rock. Due to the larger mass and higher striking force of these particles, the erosion happens more rapidly than if smaller particles were solely responsible. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Bigger particles hitting the rock can also indirectly impact the erosion process by changing the overall environment where the rocks are found. For instance, when larger particles remove significant parts of rock, they can alter the surrounding landscape and lead to further changes in environmental factors, including water flow patterns and wind speed. These alterations may, in turn, expose the rocks to different kinds of erosional forces, affecting the overall pace of erosion. This aspect is especially notable in cases where water or wind is transporting the larger particles, leading to more potent erosive forces. In summary, the perturbation of bigger particles hitting the rock both directly and indirectly impacts the erosion process. While their immediate influence involves accelerated erosion due to increased abrasion or fragmentation, they can also lead to indirect impacts through changes in environmental factors, which may further modify the rate of erosion. Therefore, in this scenario, the erosion of rocks would not be less or slower. Instead, it would most likely be quicker and more extensive due to the larger size of particles involved in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: False accusations in the workplace can touch on a number of legal issues. Being able to identify the different types of legal claims you might have can help you find the right attorney to offer you advice.  Issue-spotting is a fairly complex procedure that law students tackle extensively over three years of law school – so don't expect to become a master. However, basic issues can be spotted more easily, and point you in the direction of the type of attorney you need to consult. For example, if the false accusations relate to something that harms your reputation, you may have a defamation claim against your accuser. An accuser might file a false report against you to manipulate you into doing something for them, such as giving them a raise or a promotion. That situation involves elements of blackmail or fraud. Your accuser also may have a discriminatory motive. For example, they may have made a false accusation against you because they don't want to work with (or be supervised by) someone of your race or gender. This is an employment law issue. Apart from asking trusted family or friends for recommendations, you also may be able to find attorneys to consult by searching online. Your state or local bar association typically will have a searchable directory on its website.  Many bar associations have an attorney-referral service that will do much of that issue-spotting work for you. All you have to do is answer a few questions about your case, typically using an online form, to retrieve a list of attorneys who handle clients with problems similar to yours. Do a little research on the attorneys you find. Look at their professional websites to learn more about them and read client reviews. This can help you narrow down your list to a handful of attorneys who potentially could give you the best advice. Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation. You can use this to your advantage to get advice from a number of different lawyers without breaking the bank. This can be especially helpful if your case involves several legal issues and you're not sure which direction to take.  If you are seriously contemplating pursuing legal action, and want to hire an attorney for that purpose, you should interview at least three. However, if you're just looking for some general advice on what to do and haven't made up your mind yet what to do, feel free to talk to as many or as few attorneys as you feel is necessary to make an informed decision. When you schedule the consultation, ask if there's any information about your case that the attorney needs before the consultation. Some attorneys have a basic information form they expect all potential new clients to complete. Do your best to get any information about your case to the attorneys as soon as possible – at least several days before the consultations are scheduled. This gives the attorneys plenty of time to familiarize themselves with your situation. Often, attorneys treat free initial consultations as little more than an opportunity to market and sell their services. However, if you come armed with plenty of specific questions, you can get the information you need.  If you're planning on hiring an attorney, ask questions about their work and communication style. These consultations will be more focused on finding an attorney with whom you'll have a positive and productive working relationship. The consultation has a different focus if you're still trying to sort out what to do. Ask specific questions about your case as well as whether the attorney believes a lawsuit would be worth pursuing. Contrary to popular belief, most attorneys aren't sue-happy people who are itching to take any and every case that might come their way. If an attorney believes you don't have a case, they'll tell you. Likewise, if an attorney believes you have a case, but it's not a strong one or not one that would be worth the time and expense of a lawsuit, they'll tell you that too. After you've finished talking to several attorneys, you have a big decision to make regarding whether you want to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against your accuser.  You may decide that you want to sue your accuser, or your employer, or both. Get in touch with the attorney you felt was the best fit for you as soon as possible so you can determine your next steps. On the other hand, if you've decided filing a lawsuit would be too much effort and you'd rather just move on with your life, call the attorneys you met and thank them for their time. Keep in mind that attorneys are experts. If one (or several) attorneys have told you that a lawsuit is not worth pursuing, you're probably better off dropping the issue. Focus on your work and repairing any damage that has been done to your reputation as a result of the false accusation. Summary:","output":"False accusations in the workplace can involve various legal issues, and identifying them can help find the right attorney for advice. To find an attorney, you can ask for recommendations from family or friends, search online, or use your local bar association's attorney-referral service. Research and consult with multiple attorneys, preferably through free initial consultations, to find the best fit for your individual case. During consultations, ask specific questions about your situation and the attorney's work style. After talking to several attorneys, decide whether to file a lawsuit or pursue other legal action, and choose the attorney who is the best fit for your needs. If a lawsuit is not advised, focus on your work and repair any damage to your reputation caused by the false accusation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue the following story. in an attempt to grow my hair I applied coconut oil but my hair split because the  Pick from: (a). oil was too weak.. (b). hair was too weak..","output":"(b). hair was too weak. In an attempt to grow my hair, I applied coconut oil, but my hair split because the hair was too weak. I realized that I had been neglecting my hair's health for quite some time now. Determined to improve the situation, I decided to make a comprehensive plan to restore my hair's strength and vitality. Step 1: Research hair care techniques Before starting any new hair care routine, I spent some time researching various techniques and products that can help improve hair strength and promote growth. I visited online forums, read blog articles, and even watched YouTube videos to gather a wealth of knowledge on hair care. Step 2: Determine the root cause I wanted to figure out what factors had contributed to my hair becoming so weak. Was it the chemicals, constant heat, or improper care? Upon closer examination, I concluded that I had been using excessive heat, not trimming my split ends, and using harsh chemical-laden products. Addressing these issues would be key to restoring my hair's health. Step 3: Create a hair care routine To combat my weak hair, I developed a hair care routine that incorporated both internal and external strategies. I started taking multivitamins containing biotin, which is known for benefiting hair and nails. I also began massaging my scalp with coconut oil regularly, as well as applying deep-conditioning hair masks at least once a week. Step 4: Limit heat and chemical exposure To reduce heat exposure, I limited the use of my hair straightener, curling iron, and blow-dryer. On days when it was necessary to use these tools, I made sure to apply a heat protectant spray before styling. I also switched to sulfate-free and silicone-free hair products, as they are less harsh on the hair strands. Step 5: Trim split ends To ensure my hair was in its best condition, I visited a professional hairdresser to trim my split ends. I pledged to schedule regular trims every 6-8 weeks to prevent further damage and keep my hair looking healthy. Step 6: Stay consistent The final and most important step was consistency. I knew that following my hair care routine with dedication would yield positive results. I set reminders to help me stay on track with my routine. Over the course of a few months, I could see my hair start to regain its strength, and the split ends gradually diminished. With continuous care, not only did the coconut oil help my hair grow, but it also restored its health and vitality. The journey taught me the importance of giving my hair the attention and care it deserves."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Start on the internet by checking out national German Shepherd breed clubs like the German Shepherd Dog Club of America or the American Kennel Club.  Both of these sites provide detailed information on what to look for in an ethical breeder, and can point you toward more local resources. Do further research into these local German Shepherd breed clubs in your area. Whether you get information from their websites or contact them directly for help, local breed clubs are a great way to get the names of reputable breeders in your area. Veterinarians come into contact with a lot of different types of animal care-givers, from breeders to shelters to individual owners. Because they know so much about animal issues in the community, it's a good idea to talk to a few vets in your area for ethical breeder recommendations.  Also consider speaking to other German Shepherd owners, dog groomers, or dog trainers. If you visit a breed show, talk to owners and trainers about who they've had good or bad experiences with. A good breeder won't have a variety of breeds available for adoption. Look for a breeder who specializes only in German Shepherds. Your best option is to find a breeder who has years of experience with the German Shepherd breed. They should be able to answer your questions about development, temperament, and training easily and without hesitation. A key marker of a good breeder is the amount of effort they put into early socialization. Puppies need to be taught from an early age to live harmoniously with humans. If a breeder keeps litters isolated away from the home, the puppies will not be used to the sights and sounds of a normal household, and won't be used to human interaction. This can become a problem by the time they are old enough to be adopted. Make sure the puppies spend at least some time in the breeders' home with them. The more time they spend with humans, the more you can trust the breeder. An ethical breeder will never try to breed a female who hasn't reached sexual maturity — about 2 years of age. Mothers should also be given enough time to recover from pregnancies and being separated from their litters as they get adopted. Females should be healthy and alert. Never adopt a puppy from a breeder who breeds a young or unhealthy female, or who doesn't give mothers time to recover before breeding them again. Puppies should never be sold or separated from their mothers before 8 weeks of age. Before that, it’s unsafe to wean them from their mothers. The breeder should have begun the puppies' vaccination and deworming processes before adopting them out. Make sure that's happened, and ask about any health problems the vet may have reported in these early checkups. Ask if the breeders have their dogs tested for the Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) gene. This can determine whether a common inherited disease in German Shepherds is present in the litter's bloodline. Dogs with DM suffer from progressive paralysis, particularly in the hind legs.[5] Also ask the breeder whether the parents are \\"OFA certified\\" or \\"AKC Registered.\\" You can ask to see certification for both parents from one of these organizations, but reputable breeders usually offer this without asking. Note that being AKC-registered does not mean that you are getting a healthy animal. It means that the owner paid money to the AKC to register the dog.  The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), on the other hand, is interested in orthopedic and genetic health.  German Shepherds commonly have hip and elbow dysplasia. While experts recommend against breeding animals with known genetic problems, an OFA certification will give you proof. Be aware, though, that there's no guarantee of health in any animal. There's always a chance that two dogs free of known genetic diseases can still produce a puppy with genetic problems. The breeder should be evaluating you as a potential owner, just as you're evaluating him or her as a breeder. No good breeder will just hand over a puppy without being sure that the new owners will be able to provide it with a good, healthy life. Ask the breeder what they look for in a good owner, and whether they've ever turned potential owners away. The breeder should be able to answer these questions without even having to think about it. You might also ask the breeder for references so you can contact other families who have dogs from previous litters. A reputable breeder should ask questions about your dog background and experience, your lifestyle, and your family to guide you in making the best decision. As difficult as it may be, a good breeder will be willing to turn you away if they think you're a bad fit for their particular puppies. For example, if the litter has particularly inactive parents, the puppies may not be a good fit for your highly active lifestyle. If you get turned away, ask if the breeder can point you to other options and litters so you can expand your search. Also ask if they have any unborn litters coming up that may be a better fit for you.  Be patient and don't get discouraged. With enough patience and legwork, you'll find the right puppy. Don't lie to a breeder just to get a puppy, though. Trust the breeder's decision-making process. You don't want to end up with a dog who doesn't fit your needs. Avoid any breeder who offers to cut you a \\"deal,\\" who has unclean or smelly kennels, or who acts suspiciously in any way. Trust your instincts. A breeder who's in it just for the money has the wrong motivation, and likely isn't interested in the welfare of their dogs.  Make sure the dogs are not crowded into cages. They should have plenty of room to stumble around and explore their surroundings. Part of the time, puppies should be kept in the home to expose them to household environments. There should be adequate food and water for all animals on the premises. Kennels should be cleaned daily. Although it may be that a dog had an accident just before you arrived, be suspicious of a kennel that looks like it hasn't been cleaned recently. All reputable breeders should be willing to take the dog back should things not work out with your family. If a breeder doesn't have a return policy, it suggests they don't really care what happens to their dogs once they leave their property. That's not a good sign! Also find out what kind of documentation you would get with your puppy. Would you get registration papers and pedigree papers? Negotiate for what you want if it's not included in the contract. Be very wary of a breeder who will not discuss the chance that a puppy may need to be returned.  Does the contract require you to take the puppy for a vet visit within a set time? Does it cover hereditary issues for life? For only a certain period of time? What kind of documentation will you need to provide to “prove” your case? What does the breeder agree to offer? 100% money back? Trade for another puppy when one is available? Are there restrictions on the activities you can do with your dog that will invalidate the contract or guarantee? Are you purchasing a show prospect puppy or a pet quality animal? Does the breeder have strong feelings (or even bans) about the vaccinations, foods or supplements for your puppy? Are these opinions based on solid science?","output":"This article provides guidance on finding an ethical breeder for German Shepherd puppies and the importance of doing research before choosing a breeder.

Dogs should have ample space, food, and water, and kennels should be clean. Reputable breeders should have a return policy for puppies if they don't work out with the new family. Important considerations include the contract's terms, what documentation comes with the puppy (registration and pedigree papers), and whether the breeder requires a vet visit within a specific time. It is important to discuss any potential issues that may arise, such as the health guarantee, restrictions, breeder's views on vaccinations, foods, or supplements."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

What company was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998?","output":"Google, the American technology company, was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998. Both were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California when they developed the idea to create a more efficient and innovative search engine. Their motivation stemmed from the realization that the existing search engines at the time were insufficient and unable to cope with the explosive growth of the internet. The concept behind Google's search engine was to use a unique algorithm called PageRank, which determined the importance of websites by measuring the number and quality of other pages linking to them. This not only facilitated more accurate search results, but it also made the process faster and more convenient for users. Their innovative technology quickly gained popularity, and its founders decided to incorporate the company as Google Inc. on September 4, 1998. The company's name is derived from the word \\"googol,\\" which is a mathematical term representing the numeral one followed by 100 zeros. This name embodies the founders' vision to organize the vast amount of information available on the internet. Over the years, Google has expanded its services to cater to a wide range of user needs. Some notable products and services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, and Google Photos, as well as the Android operating system for smartphones and tablets. Google is also behind the Chrome web browser, and its digital assistant, Google Assistant, competes with the likes of Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Google's growth and influence have been staggering, transforming it from a simple search engine to an essential part of daily life for millions of people worldwide. In 2004, the company went public, and in 2015, Google restructured itself under a new umbrella company called Alphabet Inc. This move allowed for better management of its growing suite of products and services, as well as provided a clearer view of Google's various non-advertising revenue streams.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Question: \\"What cell operatives arrived in the US shortly after May 2000?\\" Answer: \\"Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"I will explain it simply for you.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Which of these structures produces male gametes in humans? What is the correct answer to this question?","output":"The correct answer to this question is that the male gametes in humans are produced by the testes (also known as testicles or gonads), which are the primary male reproductive organs. The testes are a pair of oval-shaped structures located in the scrotum, a pouch of skin hanging below the penis. The primary function of the testes is to produce sperm cells, or male gametes, and hormones, mainly testosterone. Testosterone plays a critical role in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics. Spermatogenesis, the process of sperm production, occurs in the seminiferous tubules within the testes. Each testis contains numerous seminiferous tubules, where the germ cells differentiate into mature sperm cells. This process begins with spermatogonia, which are undifferentiated male germ cells, and continues through various stages of development, including primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. Finally, mature spermatozoa are formed. They are then released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. The mature spermatozoa then travel from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis, a coiled tube next to each testis, where they undergo further maturation and gain mobility. During ejaculation, sperm are propelled from the epididymis through the vas deferens, a muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. Along the way, secretions from accessory glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands mix with the sperm to form semen, which is eventually expelled through the penis during ejaculation. In summary, the testes are the structures responsible for producing male gametes in humans. Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules within each testis, with sperm cells going through several stages of development before becoming mature spermatozoa. These spermatozoa subsequently travel through the male reproductive system, ultimately exiting the body during ejaculation as part of semen."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

The old county seat of Beichuan was abandoned and preserved as part of the Beichuan Earthquake Museum. Eight schools were toppled in Dujiangyan. A 56-year-old was killed in Dujiangyan during a rescue attempt on the Lingyanshan Ropeway, where due to the earthquake 11 tourists from Taiwan had been trapped inside cable cars since May 13. A 4-year-old boy named Zhu Shaowei (traditional Chinese: 朱紹維; simplified Chinese: 朱绍维; pinyin: Zhū Shàowéi) was also killed in Mianzhu City when a house collapsed on him and another was reported missing.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the given context, it is mentioned that one rescue team reported only 2,300 survivors from the town of Yingxiu in Wenchuan County, out of a total population of about 9,000. When comparing this number to 3,000, it is clear that the number of survivors from Yingxiu is smaller, with 2,300 survivors as opposed to the stated 3,000. The context goes on to discuss the devastating impact of the earthquake in various locations in Sichuan, detailing the massive losses in terms of human life, injuries, and destruction of buildings and infrastructure. The loss of life and property caused by the earthquake was indeed substantial and had significant consequences on the affected areas. In Beichuan County, Sichuan alone, it is mentioned that there were between 3,000 to 5,000 fatalities, with 10,000 people injured and 80% of the buildings destroyed. The old county seat of Beichuan was abandoned due to the extensive damage and preserved as part of the Beichuan Earthquake Museum.

Options: a ) 0.05 , b ) 0.9 , c ) 9 , d ) 90 , e ) none of the above Solution:","output":"To find the answer, I followed these steps using the definition of percentages and fractions: 1. First, I found the value of 2/3 of 0.5:    - Multiply 0.5 by 2/3: (2/3) * 0.5 = (2 * 0.5) / 3 = 1 / 3 = 0.3333 (approximately) 2. Next, I found the value of 15% of the result above (0.3333):    - To find the percentage, we multiply the value by the percentage (15%) expressed as a decimal (15/100 = 0.15).    - So, 0.3333 * 0.15 = 0.05 (approximately) 3. Therefore, the answer is a) 0.05. In summary, I used the definition of percentage and fractions to calculate 15% of 2/3 of 0.5, resulting in 0.05 as the answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music.

Article: Do you or someone you know use a mobile phone? In today's world, many people use a mobile phone especially businessmen and businesswomen. These people are an important part of the business world and help our economies develop. In fact in some countries even children and the elderly use mobile phones to keep in touch with family and friends. We know how useful it is to have a mobile phone, but do we know how safe these phones are? Some scientists say that mobile phones could be a risk to our health. So, money is being given to scientific research to find out if mobile phones may be harmful in any way. What does the future look like? Is a hands - free phone the answer? The idea behind hands - free sets is simple and maybe they are a safer way for people to communicate. The hands - free set has a piece in your ear and a microphone near your mouth which is connected to a wire that goes into your phone. Some scientists think this is a much safer way to use a phone. Some scientists have proved that a mobile phone 10 centimeters from your head is far safer than if the headset is right against your ear. Some reports say that hands - free sets have 95% less radiation exposure, while other reports say that hands - free sets expose you to more radiation. Governments and the mobile phone industry are researching the effects, including: * the effects of radio waves on blood pressure and the brain, such as the abilities to concentrate, remember and learn the connections between mobile phone use and brain cancer long - term effects of mobile phone use, looking at health histories of people who have used mobiles since the 1980s. They will be looking at both current mobile phones and the new generation of 4G phones. The results from these studies will help us understand more about the world beyond mobile communications. Wouldn't it be strange if scientists discovered that mobile phones were too dangerous and we had to stop using them and go back to writing letter and using the normal telephone? Question: From the passage we can know  _  . - wearing headsets is a safer way when we communicate with mobile phones - nobody can tell exactly which the safer way to use a mobile phone is - we'd better stop using hands - free sets while scientists are looking at them - there is some connections between mobile phone use and some illness A:","output":"From the passage, we can know that nobody can tell exactly which the safer way to use a mobile phone is.

Q: Passage: After their loss to Atlanta, Washington hosted the Minnesota Vikings, looking to snap an 8-game home losing streak. The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win. With the win, Washington improved to 3-3, snapped an 8-game home losing streak, and will have an opportunity to take first place in the NFC East with a victory over the defending Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants next week.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims. I have lost respect for quite a few people who I used to think were really talented. I now understand where there talent comes from… Shame on them.

He designed a meal plan that included ample fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats like nuts and seeds. He also made an effort to limit processed foods and excess sugar, which can negatively affect libido and overall health.

Title: Shooter Movie plot: As the film opens, US Special Forces sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and his scout Donny Fenn (Lane Garrison) lie in wait in the hills of Ethiopia, ready to deliver covering fire for a US convoy heading back to base through hostile country. They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames. The smoke engulfs the screen as the helicopter crashes and explodes.Three years later Swagger is a private citizen, living in the mountains, a recluse from the world that abandoned him. Unshaven and long haired, he lives alone; his only companion his dog, trained to open the fridge and take out a cold beer for Swagger as he returns to his cabin.

His current girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy), is ending their relationship and moving out of his house when a letter in a pink envelope arrives.

В автономном аспекте искусства, который является частью его \\"двойственного характера\\", Франкфуртские теоретики увидели параллель с несгибаемостью критической теории. Согласно данному подходу, искусство обладает как социальными, так и автономными функциями. С одной стороны, искусство выражает основные ценности и идеи культуры, в которой оно было создано, а с другой стороны, искусство является самодостаточной системой, не зависящей от внешних воздействий. Критическая теория, разрабатываемая Франкфуртской школой, стремилась раскрыть и обозначить социальные, политические и экономические противоречия и процессы, которые мешали развитию свободного и равноправного общества. Эта теория носит противостоящий характер, так как критикует господствующие системы власти и культурные нормы. Таким образом, несгибаемость критической теории проявляется в ее стремлении выявлять и анализировать социальные проблемы и процессы независимо от принятых видений и условий. Сходство между автономным аспектом искусства и несгибаемостью критической теории заключается в том, что обе сферы демонстрируют самостоятельность от традиционных догм и структур. Искусство, как и критическая теория, основывается на самостоятельном мышлении и анализе, что позволяет им избегать ограничений, наложенных традиционными идеологиями и культурными нормами.

Население Руанды Translate to English English:","output":"The Population of Rwanda Rwanda is an East African country known for its scenic landscapes, mainly comprising mountains and hills. Despite being one of the smallest countries in Africa, it has a large population, which has been steadily increasing over the years. As of 2021, the population of Rwanda is estimated to be around 13 million people. This marks a significant increase from the 1994 figure of about 7.95 million, a year that saw Rwanda devastated by a horrific genocide. Consequently, population growth has been an essential aspect of the country's recovery and rebuilding process. The population density in Rwanda is one of the highest in Africa, with approximately 525 people per square kilometer. The nation's urban population is relatively low, with approximately 18% of the people living in urban areas. The capital city, Kigali, is the largest and most populous city, accounting for around 1.2 million residents. Most Rwandans belong to one of three main ethnic groups: Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. The Hutu ethnic group comprises about 85% of the population, while the Tutsi and Twa account for 14% and 1%, respectively. Though ethnic tensions played a significant role in the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government has since implemented policies and campaigns to promote unity and reconciliation among these groups. The official languages of Rwanda are Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili, with Kinyarwanda being the most common language spoken among the people. The literacy rate has been improving, with the current rate standing at approximately 73%. Rwanda's population has a relatively young age structure, with about 60% of the people under the age of 25. This presents challenges in terms of education and employment opportunities but also provides the nation with a potentially vibrant workforce for future economic growth. The life expectancy in Rwanda has been increasing as well, currently standing at around 69 years for both males and females. The Rwandan government has been emphasizing economic growth and development in the country, focusing primarily on sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology. The population growth comes with the need to provide adequate resources, including education, healthcare, and job opportunities for the Rwandan people. To sum up, Rwanda's population has been steadily growing in the past few decades despite its history of conflict and tragedy. The country's government has made strides in fostering unity among ethnic groups and investing in economic growth to ensure the wellbeing of its citizens. Continued progress in healthcare, education, and economic sectors will be crucial for Rwanda's future development and the welfare of its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Brett was more focused on socializing and enjoying the party scene, Matthew was the complete opposite, dedicating himself to his academic pursuits without fail. Step 1: Establish their differing priorities This contrast between their personalities highlighted the fact that they each had a different set of priorities. Brett believed in living in the moment, attending parties, and enjoying his youth. In contrast, Matthew felt that his college years were an opportunity to advance his future career prospects and dedicated the majority of his time to getting a solid education. Step 2: Explore the consequences of their choices As college progressed, the consequences of their choices began to manifest. Brett's grades started declining due to his constant partying, while Matthew maintained a stellar academic record. Despite their differences, they remained friends and occasionally attempted to influence each other's habits. Matthew would try to convince Brett to pay more attention to his studies, while Brett would coax Matthew into attending a party or two. Step 3: Show how they influenced each other Through the years, they both influenced each other in subtle ways. Brett helped Matthew to realize the importance of having a social life and creating memorable experiences outside of his academic obligations. On the other hand, Matthew's disciplined approach to his studies prompted Brett to put more effort into his college work, improving his own academic performance to some extent. Step 4: Describe the outcome of their college experience As graduation approached, both Brett and Matthew had experienced growth, not just in their respective academics or social lives, but also as individuals. They had learned valuable lessons from one another, which they would carry with them beyond their college years. Matthew had learned to have a better balance in his life, making time for leisure activities and socializing while still excelling academically.

The second sentence, \\"It was built in the 17th century and had in the 14th century,\\" does not follow a clear timeline and appears to have a misplaced phrase. It states that the structure or object was built in the 17th century, but then inaccurately refers to the 14th century. If the intent was to express that an earlier version of the structure or object existed in the 14th century, a more appropriate phrasing would be, \\"It was built in the 17th century and had an earlier version in the 14th century.\\" Even with this rephrased sentence, it still has a different meaning than the first one, as it refers to two distinct versions of the subject rather than a continuous timeframe. In conclusion, based on the information given in the two sentences, they do not share the same meaning. This is primarily due to the different historical timeframes referenced and the unclear timeline in the second sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once the substances trypsin and chymotrypsin have broken down the proteins in the stomach into smaller chains of amino acids, other pancreatic enzymes such as amylase and lipase work on the carbohydrates and fats, respectively. This action further breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. As digestion progresses, the resulting smaller molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream. The increased glucose triggers the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that signals body cells to absorb glucose from the bloodstream for energy, glycogen synthesis, or conversion to fat. Simultaneously, the amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol are absorbed by cells as building blocks for new proteins and fats, as well as for generating energy. Lastly, the pancreas also secretes another hormone called glucagon when necessary. Glucagon works in opposition to insulin, signaling the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream if blood sugar levels drop too low. This intricate system involving insulin and glucagon maintains a proper energy balance and ensures stable blood sugar levels within the body. In summary, the last step in the process involves the body regulating blood sugar levels through hormones insulin and glucagon and the absorption of nutrients like amino acids, fatty acids, and simple sugars into body cells for growth, repair, and energy production. This intricate balance is essential for maintaining overall health and homeostasis for optimal bodily function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of dance and Dance TV. When Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out, Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions. At the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she rudely parks her car where Lynne is walking. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner gets her cut (it is later found out that Natalie paid him to have her kicked out). Janey and a dreamboat named Jeff both shine, albeit partnered with others at first. They are later paired once the final cut is made. Jeff loves to dance although his father is drilling him to go to trade school and is following his heart instead of his father's wishes. The two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice when it's convenient for Jeff. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling (she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \\"Sister Natalie\\"). An excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to strangers all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the extra invited people show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl...

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose from: --no --yes","output":"\\"Yes\\", both of the questions you have asked do pertain to the same basic inquiry, although the wording is slightly different. They both deal with understanding the differences between cascade and cascode amplifiers. A cascade connection (also known as a two-stage amplification) and a cascode configuration are both multistage designs of amplifiers, they are used to gain advantages in terms of bandwidth, gain, and stability. However, they accomplish this in different ways, hence leading to different characteristics on their performances. [1] The Cascade configuration: In a cascade amplifier, two or more amplifier stages are sequentially connected (cascaded), with the output of one stage serving as the input for the next one. Each individual stage can have a different gain based upon the requirement. The total gain is then the product of the gain of each stage. This configuration is mainly employed for getting a high gain. However, as the number of stages increases, the gain bandwidth decreases because each stage adds a certain amount of phase shift that in turn can lead to stability issues if not properly compensated. Moreover, the cascade amplifier is also subject to the gain-bandwidth tradeoff, where an increase in gain will lead to a decrease in bandwidth. The fundamental benefit of cascade amplifiers is that they have the ability to provide a large amount of amplification, especially for low-level signals, before the signal is applied to a power amplifier. Therefore, they can be beneficial in improving the signal-to-noise ratio. [2] The Cascode configuration: The cascode amplifier consists of a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage in case of a BJT, or common-source followed by common-gate for a FET. Unlike the cascade configuration where the stages are connected in series, the cascode configuration has stages connected in a specific back-to-back arrangement in such a way that the output of the first transistor is the input of the second transistor. The main benefits of the cascode amplifier are improved frequency response (bandwidth), better linearity, lower noise, and a high input impedance along with low output impedance. Although it does not have a large gain like a cascade amplifier, it significantly improves the gain-bandwidth product. One more notable advantage of a cascode amplifier is its ability to isolate the Miller effect (an effect that reduces the gain and bandwidth of an amplifier), thus improving the amplifier’s high frequency response. The main drawback of the cascode amplifier is that it needs a high supply voltage because the voltages of the two stages are effectively added together. In conclusion, both configurations have their own advantages and disadvantages. The cascade amplifier is good for systems that require high amplification of weak signals, while the cascode amplifier is an excellent choice for systems requiring a wide bandwidth and noise immunity. The choice between the two depends heavily on the specific application and the needs of the system in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: James shook his money box again. Nothing! He carefully counted the coins that lay on the bed. 24. 17 was all that he had. The bicycle he wanted was at least 90! How was he going to get the end of the money? He knew that his friends all had bicycles. It was hard to hang around with people when you were the only one without wheels. He thought about what he could do. It was no use asking his parents, for he knew they had no money to save. There was only one way to get money, and that was to earn it. He would have to find a job. But who would hire him and what could he do? He decided to ask Mr. Clay for advice, who usually had opinions on most things. \\"Well, you can start right here,\\" said Mr. Clay. \\"My windows need cleaning and my car needs washing. \\" That was the beginning of James' part-time job. For three months he worked every day after finishing his homework. He was amazed by the different kinds of jobs that people found for him to do. He took dogs and babies for walks, cleared out cupboards, and mended books. He lost count of the number of cars he washed and windows he cleaned, but the money increased and he knew that he would soon have enough for the bicycle he was eager to have. The day finally came when James counted his money and found 94. 32. He wasted no time and went down to the shop to pick up the bicycle he wanted. He rode proudly home, looking forward to showing his new bicycle to his friends. It had been hard working for the money, but James knew that he valued his bicycle far more since he had bought it with his own money. Question: The only way for James to earn money was to   _  . Options: A: find a part-time job B: borrow some from his parents C: ask Mr. Clay for help D: study very hard A:","output":"The correct answer to this question would be A: find a part-time job. From the context of the article, it's clear that James' sole answer to his problem was to earn money. His parents were unable to provide any form of financial assistance, as explicitly stated in the passage. Asking Mr. Clay for help was indeed part of his action plan, but what Mr. Clay offered him was not a cash loan or a favor, but an opportunity to earn money - a job. The form of help Mr. Clay provided is differenct from simply giving money or a loan. So, looking through the options, we can rule out B: borrow some from his parents, as the article mentioned that the parents didn't have any money to spare. We can also rule out C: ask Mr. Clay for help, as although James did ask Mr. Clay for some assistance, what he received in return was not a handout but an opportunity for employment. D: study very hard can also be ruled out as the article makes no reference to studying hard as a way to earn money. In fact, the article posits the idea that James was focused on doing multiple odd jobs to amass the required sum for his desired bicycle. So, the remaining option is A: find a part-time job. This fits best with the provided information in the article, as James did various tasks like cleaning windows or washing cars in order to earn money for his bicycle. He embarked on a part-time endeavor and developed a work ethic as he carried out a variety of jobs. This independent venture of his to earn money, which was necessitated by the situation he was in, yielded the required results after a dedicated period of three months. So, the most fitting answer to the question \\"The only way for James to earn money was to____\\" is indeed A: find a part-time job."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the song that was described by Phares as having a sexy menace? from the following article ?  Bryant identified \\"Son of Three\\" as an example of \\"when the Breeders set out to rock\\", noting \\"the chugging guitars and stomping drums.\\" The Breeders re-recorded \\"Son of Three\\" in July 2002 for its release as Title TK's third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardian's Betty Clarke cited the line \\"Obey your colorist, bleach it all away\\" as an example of Title TK's amusing, off-center lyrics. On \\"Sinister Foxx\\", Deal repeatedly sings \\"Has anyone seen the iguana?\\" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: \\"Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana.\\" Another line, \\"I'm in beer class every Thursday night\\", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk.

The man, taking a break from his work, patiently answers the child's inquiries, explaining the importance of maintaining a well-groomed lawn, the function of the lawn mower, and how it collects all the grass clippings into the collection hopper bag. As the child listens attentively, he becomes fascinated by the mechanical aspects of the lawn mower and wonders if there are other machines that help maintain a lawn or garden.

To watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending. No time for courting: fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work. This was based on the woman's actual diary, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves. She learned to mow, which was not lady-like. She was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun-browned, calloused hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow, and she was happy to do it. Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I am sure it would have been fine. That only makes the tragedy extra sad. I was crying so hard. But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is on its way, and life goes on.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Pauly D, however, was happy to take it off his hands, dropping a coold 450,000 on Bilzerian's now-famous ebay ad. Pauly D's new ride will look right at home among the fancy rides that line the Las Vegas strip, where the Jersey Shore DJ can be found during his year-long residency at the Aria Resort & Casino. With over 700-horsepower from its massive V-12, we can only hope that Mr. D is qualified to handle such a powerful car, as even we found it to be quite the beast during our weekend together. No word yet on what Bilzerian's next chariot of choice will be, but it will have to be pretty extreme to top the Aventador. Summary:","output":"Recently, DJ Paul \\"Pauly D\\" DelVecchio bought Dan Bilzerian's white Lamborghini Aventador Roadster for 450,000. Bilzerian, known as \\"Instagram's Most Interesting Man,\\" sold the supercar because he did not have enough room for it. Pauly D's new acquisition complements his residency at the Aria Resort & Casino on the Las Vegas strip. The powerful Lamborghini Aventador Roadster boasts over 700 horsepower from its V-12 engine. It remains unclear which vehicle Bilzerian will purchase next to replace the Aventador."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a title for this article: By Shelby Lin Erdman, CNN updated 4:13 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2014 (CNN) -- Two island paradises may be spared heavy damage this weekend, as hurricanes roar through the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The worst was over early Saturday for the British territory of Bermuda in the North Atlantic Ocean, after Hurricane Gonzalo passed over. And in the South Pacific, forecasters say the center of Hurricane Ana will slink by about 150 miles southwest of Hawaii. Over 80% of households in Bermuda were without power, according to a local newspaper, the Royal Gazette, which has reported no deaths, injuries or major damage due to the storm. A tropical storm a week earlier had knocked out power to nearly as many customers, the Gazette reported. Gonzalo weakened from a powerful Category 3 storm Friday evening to a Category 2 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It battered the island with wind gusts that topped 115 mph at one point, the agency said, as the storm moved in a northeasterly direction at 16 mph. Ahead of the storm, Bermuda closed schools, shut down bus and ferry service, and opened up shelters. Forecasters predicted Gonzalo will weaken to as it moves past Bermuda and pushes into the North Atlantic. 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season facts Hurricane Ana strengthened into a Category 1 storm Friday afternoon with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. But the hurricane is far enough away that forecasters predict its effects will amount to tropical storm conditions in parts of the islands over the weekend. But Gov. Neil Abercrombie isn't taking any chances. Abercrombie declared a state of emergency earlier this week in advance of Ana's arrival. The emergency proclamation \\"allows us to respond quickly to any potential impacts,\\" he said. Ana could cause dangerous surf conditions, coastal flooding and mudslides as it moves through the region. Some areas could see up to the 8 inches of rain with as much as 12 inches in isolated areas. Hurricanes are a rare occurrence in Hawaii. Only three storms have made a direct landfall on the islands in the past 55 years, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. But it's already been an unusual year for Hawaiians, weatherwise. The island chain has already been hit by two damaging tropical storms so far this season.

Q:Information:  - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence  though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.  - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a thin vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows.  - Lucerne (Lucerne Swiss-German: \\"Lozärn\\") is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country.

Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run","output":"The given review expresses a mixed opinion about the movie, leaning more towards a negative perspective. There are a few aspects of the review that contribute to this conclusion, which we will explore further. 1. The reviewer mentions that the movie has an \\"interesting\\" screenplay. This term is not particularly strong in conveying a positive or negative judgment, as the reviewer is simply stating that it is engaging in some way. However, it implies that there might be some aspects of the screenplay that the reviewer appreciates. 2. After the word \\"interesting,\\" the reviewer states that the screenplay \\"lags badly in the middle.\\" This is a negative evaluation, as it suggests that the movie's pace becomes slow and uninteresting, which could negatively impact the viewer's enjoyment. 3. The review continues by pointing out the lack of consistency in the movie's tone, mentioning that it \\"lurches between not-very-funny comedy, unconvincing dramatics.\\" By using the term \\"lurches,\\" the reviewer implies that the movie does not handle transitions between different tones effectively. Additionally, the mention of \\"not-very-funny comedy\\" and \\"unconvincing dramatics\\" indicate that the reviewer finds both the comedic and dramatic aspects of the movie unsatisfactory. 4. Lastly, the reviewer references the movie's \\"last-minute action\\" as \\"strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run.\\" This comparison can be perceived in two ways: either as an appreciation of the action scenes or a criticism of the seemingly derivative nature of these scenes. As the reviewer does not provide an explicit positive or negative judgment about the action scenes, it is difficult to determine their overall satisfaction with this aspect of the movie. In conclusion, while there are some potentially interesting aspects that the reviewer acknowledges, the negative points outweigh them overall. The review highlights concerns related to the screenplay, pacing, and tone inconsistency, leading us to determine that the reviewer's opinion of the movie is primarily negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Research the company: Thorough research of the companies prior to the interview will give you a solid understanding of their business model, goals, and culture.

This will allow you to demonstrate your knowledge and interest during the interview. 2. Understand the job requirements: You must have a clear understanding of the job position for which you are applying and the skills and qualifications it demands.

Develop questions for your interviewer: Asking thoughtful questions about the company and role will showcase your dedication and interest in the position. Keep in mind that interviews are not just for the employer to learn about you, but for you to learn about the company and whether it would be a good fit. 5. Dress appropriately: First impressions are essential, so ensure you dress professionally for the interview. Dressing a step above the company's expected dress code will convey your respect and professionalism. 6. Practice good body language: Maintain eye contact, smile, give a firm handshake, and sit up straight. These gestures demonstrate that you are confident, respectful, and attentive. 7. Follow up after the interview: Send a thank-you email within 24 hours of the interview. This message should express your appreciation for the opportunity, reiterate your interest in the position, and remind the interviewers of any key points from your conversation.

Charles Elwood \\"Chuck\\" Yeager (; born February 13, 1923) is a retired United States Air Force general officer, flying ace and record-setting test pilot. In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight. Yeager's career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army Air Forces. In 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviation's highest honor. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal \\"equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the XS-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947.\\" President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on December 8, 1976.  Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including Flying Magazine, the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. Marshall University has named its highest academic scholarship, the Society of Yeager Scholars, in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Association's Young Eagle Program from 1994-2004, and has been named the program's chairman emeritus.  Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, is named in his honor. The Interstate 64/Interstate 77 bridge over the Kanawha River in Charleston is named in his honor. On October 19, 2006, the state of West Virginia also honored Yeager with a marker along Corridor G (part of U.S. 119) in his home Lincoln County, and also renamed part of the highway the Yeager Highway.  Yeager is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope. On August 25, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver announced that Yeager would be one of 13 California Hall of Fame inductees in The California Museum's yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on December 1, 2009, in Sacramento, California. Flying Magazine ranked Yeager number 5 on its 2013 list of The 51 Heroes of Aviation; he is the highest-ranked living person on the list.  The Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the USAF, awards the Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Yeager Award to its Senior Members as part of its Aerospace Education program.

Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"stern\\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Input: Context Word: Asthma. Output:","output":"Task Explanation: In this task, you will create a pair of sentences based on the given context word \\"Asthma.\\" Each sentence will have a blank (_), and the sentences should be similar in structure but describe two different people (PersonX and PersonY). The sentences should also include contrasting attributes about the individuals mentioned, using different trigger words. The correct answers for the blanks should be PersonX for the first sentence and PersonY for the second sentence. Guidelines: 1. Use the context word (Asthma) in both sentences. 2. Each sentence should have at least 15 and at most 30 words. 3. The two sentences should have at least 70% overlapping words. 4. Do not use explicit, offensive, or adult content. 5.

Make sure PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. 9. PersonX must be used once and appear before PersonY in each sentence. Example: Context Word: Asthma Output: Sentence 1: Due to severe _ and allergies, PersonX often has to stay indoors, while PersonY enjoys outdoor sports without any issue. Sentence 2: PersonX always carries an inhaler because of their _ problem, but PersonY simply needs it for emergency situations. In this example, the contrasting attributes are \\"severe\\" vs. \\"enjoying outdoor sports without any issue,\\" and \\"always carries\\" vs. \\"needs it for emergency situations.\\" The context word \\"Asthma\\" is utilized in both sentences."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Watching bison up close is fascinating, like watching a grass fire about to leap out of control. With their huge, wedge-shaped heads and silver-dollar-size brown eyes, the 2,000-pound animals are symbols of another place and time. More than 100 bison now roam the 30,000-acre American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana -- the first time they've inhabited that region in a century. Direct descendants of the tens of millions of bison that once populated the Western plains, they represent an epic effort: to restore a piece of America's prairie to the national grandeur that Lewis and Clark extolled two centuries ago. During that famous expedition across the Western states to the Pacific, the two explorers encountered so many bison that they had to wait hours for one herd to pass. In order to protect what's here and reintroduce long-gone wildlife (something the World Wildlife Fund is helping with), the American Prairie Foundation began purchasing land from local ranchers in 2004. It now owns 30,000 acres and has grazing privileges on another 57,000. Its goal over the next 25 years is to assemble three million acres, the largest area of land devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States. Already, herds of elk, deer, and pronghorn antelope roam the grasslands, where visitors can camp, hike, and bike. Cottonwoods and willows are thriving along streams, creating habitats for bobcats, beavers, and other animals. Not everyone shares APF's vision. Some residents of Phillips County (pop. 3,904) worry that the area could become a prairie Disneyland, overcrowded with tourists. But the biggest obstacle is the ranchers themselves, whose cattle compete with prairie dogs and bison for grass and space. \\"People like me have no intention of selling their ranches,\\" says Dale Veseth, who heads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance of 35 families in Phillips County and whose family has been ranching here since 1886. \\"They've been a labor of love through the generations.\\" Instead, he wants APF to pay or ranchers to raise... Question: Which would be the best title for this passage? Options: A: The exciting scenery in eastern Montana B: Great changes in raising bison in America C: The return of the American prairie D: The challenge in protecting the grassland The answer to this question is:","output":"C: The return of the American prairie"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.  Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Problem:the Society over in Russia when the company began to sell its SMIRNOV vodka there. A pending litigation in a foreign country between essentially the same parties, even one that concerned a slightly different topic, has been found to create a objectively reasonably apprehension of suit. See Ethicon, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 369 F.Supp. 934, 936-37 (D.N.J.1973). Therefore, even though it appears as if the defendants have never directly threatened the plaintiffs with legal action in the United States, the court concludes that the plaintiffs have introduced sufficient evidence to support their claim that they reasonably feared a lawsuit if they attempted to enter the U.S. market.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"The region of France would classify mangas under which term?\\" is in \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, \\"les littératures dessinées\\" would be the term that the region of France would classify manga under. This term, which translates to \\"drawn literatures,\\" refers to the broader category of visual storytelling forms such as comics and graphic narratives, including manga. Harry Morgan, a comics theorist, sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées,\\" which emphasizes the diverse and equally valid forms this medium has taken throughout history. While French comics theory gives special attention to page-level analysis, manga, as part of \\"drawn literatures,\\" would still fall under this term in the context of French classification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso Movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help â advice that Alfredo often... My question: Where does Salvatore like to spend his time?

On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: You are given a new situation: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.  and a hint : The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Please answer this question : Which gardener didn't increase predator population? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Kat, who applied conventional gardening methods, did not increase the predator population in her garden. Joe, on the other hand, implemented no-till gardening techniques, which have been shown to provide benefits to predators, potentially leading to larger predator populations. These increased predator populations can be advantageous for controlling pests through biological control methods, but they can also facilitate predation of the crop itself. It is essential to understand that no single method of farming or gardening is universally superior. The choice of tillage practice depends on various factors, including local climate, soil type, and specific agricultural issues. Agroecologists, therefore, evaluate the necessity of different practices depending on the unique context in which each farm or garden is situated. In summary, Kat, who employed conventional gardening methods, did not increase predator populations in her garden, whereas Joe, who adopted the no-till gardening method, may have contributed to a larger predator population, with both pros and cons associated with that outcome."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is returning to England aboard the Orient Express, encountering his friend Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which owns the line.

Members of Reclaim Australia, the True Blue Crew and other groups, some from Sydney, were among those in attendance who oppose the imminent arrival or refugees. Penny Tridgell, 20, said she opposed the idea because “aged care is for the elderly”. “With refugees you don’t know their history or what they’re capable of doing, or even where they’ve come from,” she said Supporters for the plan were also in attendance – more than 8,000 hand-made “welcome butterflies” dotted Andrews Park to welcome proposed residents. Nina Kelabora, from the group Welcome to Eltham, said the butterflies are the community's way of saying refugees are welcome. Up to 120 asylum seekers would be housed under the proposal.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the people the professor threatens to have arrested?, using the article: In a music store, a woman orders a player piano as a surprise birthday gift for her husband. She tells the manager her address — 1127 Walnut Avenue — and he hires the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company to deliver the piano in their freight wagon. The duo soon learn from a postman that the home is at the top of a very long stairway. Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, twice with Ollie in tow. During their first attempt, they encounter a lady with a baby carriage trying to go down the steps; in trying to let her pass, they knock the piano back down the stairs. After the lady laughs at them, Stan kicks her in her backside, causing her to punch him back and hit Ollie over the head with a milk bottle. Stan and Ollie then heft the piano back up the stairs. The angry lady tells a policeman on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is \\"bounding over his steps\\" (i.e. \\"overstepping his bounds\\").

Question: The answer to the question: What is the modern name of the photograph by the commercial photographer that inspired an 1888 oil painting? is inside the article: Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

For years, he worked as a farmer in his small village, and now it was time for him to explore new opportunities in the bustling city. With determination, he boarded the train for his long journey. As the train rumbled past the fields and into the urban jungle, Ram couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Little did he know that his city adventure would begin with a setback. At some point during the journey, a thief managed to steal Ram's wallet and clothes, leaving him with only the attire he was wearing. Despite this inconvenience, Ram was not one to give up. Upon arriving in the city, he quickly found employment as a taxi driver. On his first day, he had the good fortune of meeting a young woman named Reshma, who was both kind and strikingly beautiful. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, and Ram felt like he'd known her for years. He suspected their connection ran deeper than mere coincidence. Intrigued by Reshma's charisma, Ram learned that she worked for an organization called Devataa, which helped people find stable employment and affordable housing. Reshma told him that Devataa was committed to helping individuals like Ram secure good jobs so they could eventually own their own apartments. Ram's curiosity was piqued, and the prospect of a better life inspired him further. As the days went by, Ram continued his pursuit of a better job while working as a taxi driver. His encounter with Reshma had given him hope and direction. However, his newfound sense of purpose was about to be tested by an unexpected turn of events. One evening, Ram picked up a passenger who seemed in a hurry. His name was Niranjan Das, and he was anxious about getting to his destination as quickly as possible. Ram sensed something off about the man but didn't give it much thought. After dropping Niranjan off, he continued his daily routine, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing ahead. Several days later, Ram found himself being summoned to the police station. The Deputy Commissioner of Police informed him that Niranjan Das had been found dead on the night of Ram's encounter with him, and Ram was the last known person to have seen him alive. As a result, the Deputy Commissioner deemed him a prime suspect in Niranjan's murder. Overwhelmed by disbelief, Ram maintained his innocence. His thoughts turned to Reshma, and he knew that she believed in him. With Reshma and Devataa by his side, Ram prepared to clear his name and seek justice. He was determined not to let the unfair suspicions derail his pursuit of a better life, for himself and for the many people Devataa was striving to help. The story of Ram Kumar Singh, which began with him relocating by train, would not end in despair but rather with hope, resilience, and an unwavering belief in the power of human connection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering How would Lee feel afterwards? Pick from: -- upset; -- validated; -- hurt; The answer is:","output":"Lee would likely feel validated after driving home a valid point in their argument with other people. This feeling of validation comes from the fact that Lee was not only able to articulate their thoughts and opinions clearly, but also manage to have their perspectives acknowledged by others in the discussion. When people are able to support their viewpoint with logic and evidence, it typically instills a sense of confidence and satisfaction, as it demonstrates their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. Feeling validated is a natural human emotion, as it provides a sense of worth and accomplishment. In Lee's case, defending their point of view during an argument and succeeding at making a persuasive case would contribute to their self-assurance and reinforce their belief in their own opinions. However, it's important to note that while Lee may feel validated in this instance, emotions can be complex and multifaceted. It's possible that they may also experience other emotions depending on the specific context and outcome of the argument. For example, if the conversation continued in a negative or antagonistic manner, they may also feel upset or hurt. Conversely, if the exchange was respectful and productive, they may experience additional positive emotions, such as pride or contentment. Overall, while the primary emotion Lee may experience after arguing their point effectively is likely to be validation, it's essential to consider the broader context and individual factors that may impact their feelings. People respond differently to various situations, and emotions can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances and unique personalities involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An argument for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, is ipso facto an argument against materialism. Matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why is it possible to gather direct evidence?","output":"It is possible to gather direct evidence because our subjective perceptions, while not providing us access to the ultimate and independent nature of external reality, do still provide us with reliable and consistent information about the world. The continuous nature and coherence of our perceptions allow us to draw meaningful conclusions and make predictions about our experiences. Furthermore, while some idealist arguments claim that there is no direct experience of matter and that all we have are perceptions, we can still extract useful and practical knowledge from these perceptions. Direct evidence, in the context of these idealist arguments, is considered inaccessible. However, we can use our experiences, observations, and our ability to communicate with and learn from others to form a collective pool of empirical knowledge about our world. Our ability to gather this shared knowledge and communicate it to others helps us to establish principles, laws, and theories to explain our experiences, even if we cannot access the underlying nature of reality beyond our perceptions. This empirical knowledge, regardless of its ultimate 'directness,' is still valuable in understanding and navigating the world in which we live. So, while idealist arguments like those of Hegel and Berkeley may raise philosophical questions about the nature of direct evidence and the ultimate reality of matter, we can still gather evidence through our perceptions, shared experiences, and empirical knowledge that allows us to make meaningful predictions and inferences about the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Solaris Movie plot: Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides. Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin... My question: who becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence? Answer:","output":"In the movie Solaris, the character who becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence is Hari (played by Natalya Bondarchuk), an apparition of Kelvin's deceased wife. She is a manifestation created by the oceanic planet Solaris, which has the ability to tap into the memories and consciousness of the space station's crew members and create physical manifestations of their pasts. Over time, Hari gradually gains more independence, self-awareness, and understanding of her true nature as a creation of Solaris. In the end, she chooses to return to the planet's ocean, eventually existing separately from Kelvin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Universities with strong music programs are particularly likely to have concert halls, as these are essential for hosting recitals, concerts, and masterclasses. Additionally, these concert halls not only serve the university's musical needs but also often host other events, such as lectures, panel discussions, and presentations. The other options provided are less likely to have concert halls: 1.

Soldiers and photographers think so. The photo from the war front in eastern Ukraine is striking: A cascade of mud, dirt and debris rockets skyward as three soldiers run toward cover. To their right, a discarded baby carriage almost within arms’ reach. The picture, posted on Facebook earlier this month, quickly went viral as a token of a war that often seems forgotten. But a number of Ukraine-based photographers and soldiers claim the photo was staged. In an open letter, the photographers said the picture is a “clumsy” attempt at information war and that if the photo is fake, it has the potential to damage the reputation of the Ukrainian media writ large. Dmitry Muravsky, the man who took the picture and an amateur photographer who volunteers with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, insists the image is real. The dispute has broken out primarily on Facebook and on a Ukrainian news site that published the open letter. The issue is particularly sensitive since fledgling Ukrainian outlets have been deadlocked with their better-funded Russian counterparts for more than two years in their efforts to show opposing sides of a war in which propaganda has played a major part. The conflict between government troops and Russian-backed separatists has killed upward of 9,500 people. “We emphasize that the only thing we are winning in the conflict with Russia is uncompromising and truthful presentation of information from the [front],” the letter reads. “We kindly ask not to put these photos on a par with Russian fakes. The war is really going on, really, people are dying, and to prove it there is [a huge] number of documentary photo and video evidence.” If the photo is fake, it enters a long line of war images marred by controversy, such as Robert Capa’s “Falling Soldier” taken during the Spanish Civil War. In conversations with Muravsky over WhatsApp and Facebook, the photographer said that the picture in question was taken June 4 in the small village of Shyrokne just east of the coastal city of Mariupol and that the explosion was created by “the enemy.” The village has been a flash point for artillery duels and small-arms fire since Ukrainian volunteer battalions pushed the separatists out of Mariupol in the summer of 2014. Since Muravsky published the picture to his Facebook on Aug. 15, he has returned to the village and interviewed two of the soldiers supposedly depicted in the image. While the soldiers in the video confirmed the incident, according to a translation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, an officer from the unit wrote in a Facebook post that the men in the video had been co-opted by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to Muravsky’s account. The officer, a platoon commander named Viktor Moroz, said he served in Shyrokne from February to June but was not there when Muravsky took the picture. “If Muravsky or the Ministry of Defense begins to put pressure on the commanders of the unit or on the guys, I will learn about this at once. And I hope and believe that my instructions to the men always to act according to their conscience and those days that we spent as one fighting family did not pass in vain,” he wrote. “I officially declare that Muravsky’s photo with the explosion in [Shyrokne] was staged. The place is real, it’s on the front. The men were told what to do and how to act, there were no injuries and sprained limbs. There was no bombardment, an explosive device was detonated remotely, covered in a sack or in cement or in a mixture used for construction, or in chalk.” According to Kenton Fulmer, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician and current researcher at Armament Research Services, the picture of the blast supports Moroz’s assertion that the explosive was indeed buried underneath something, though a similar effect could have been made by a mortar or artillery round set to explode after penetrating the surface. “If the mortar had a short delay-action fuse, as opposed to a super quick fuse, then it could present a similar pattern, but I would hope to see some sort of signature fragmentation,” Fulmer said, adding that he would need physical evidence to make hard conclusions. Muravsky provided the raw image and a number of sequential photos following the blast to The Washington Post for analysis. When asked for the photographs before the explosion, Muravsky said he deleted them because they were “unnecessary.” “I am not a pro and had not intention of this photo to give to the press so did not know these standards,” he said. According to an image analysis provided by researchers at the Monterey, Calif.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, who ran the photo through a piece of forensic software called Tungstène, there is relatively little evidence of tampering on the raw photo. The picture was taken at 12:50:29 p.m. on June 4, according to the researchers who have experience analyzing photography. The camera was focused on the left side of the frame, specifically at the baby carriage. According to a Ukrainian Ministry of Defense-associated website that maintains a record of attacks on the front, there was a mortar strike in Shyrokne from 12:45 to 12:47. From June 4 to July 4, there were only three other mortar attacks that occurred before 5 p.m.; the other 11 during that time frame occurred after dusk, according to the site. Cease-fire monitors were in the village from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. that morning but did not record explosions for that day, according to Alexandra Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE. “Of course, this does not preclude that this happened, and we did not observe it,” she said. Muravsky uploaded the picture to his Facebook on Aug. 15 into his album titled “Pain of War.” The photos in the album have no captions. Roughly two days later, the pictures began circulating on Twitter and were featured in a Business Insider article titled “Images from the front lines of Ukraine are a vivid reminder that there’s still a war going on in Europe” The article features a photograph that Muravsky included in his “Pain of War” album depicting two soldiers running in a trench with an explosion behind them. We don't see much of it in US, but eastern Ukraine is a very real shooting war, people via @MrKovalenko pic.twitter.com/fwCE6MJg8Z — Michael Crowley (@michaelcrowley) August 17, 2016 The photo appears in the same series as the one under scrutiny, but when asked about the trench picture, Muravsky said it happened at a different time and place but would not specify when and where the photo was taken. When asked whether it was training or combat, Muravsky said that he was “not prepared to discuss the photo.” In another album of his, Muravsky has a picture of Ukrainian troops with similar camouflage patterns and markings on their helmets as those of the soldiers in the trench. In this image, however, the soldiers are kneeling in a field as explosions erupt from a nearby tree line. Muravsky says the picture was taken during training. Both the field and trench images were uploaded the same day. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Muravsky has given past photos to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, and they have been used in advertisements for the military. On Aug. 25, Muravsky said in a Facebook post that he would respond to any further allegations that his photo is staged in the form of a lawsuit. Andrew Roth in Moscow contributed to this report.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the last names of the three lesser known composers that Tyrrell talks about when he says a view of Czech music has been propagated that downplays the contributions of contemporaries and successors?  Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Once The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Once in a Lifetime Genre: Drama, Adventure, Romance Plot Summary: 'Once in a Lifetime' is a heartwarming, thrilling, and romantic tale of two strangers, Alex and Emma, who accidentally cross paths during a one-time-only celestial event: the sudden appearance of a mysterious comet that circles the Earth once every thousand years. Upon its arrival, the enchanting comet somehow grants those who gaze upon it the rare opportunity to change a single moment in their lives, offering a second chance for love and adventure. Act 1: Meet Alex, an ambitious but overworked architect struggling to find balance between his career and his passion for travel and photography. After witnessing a breathtaking meteor shower, he stumbles upon a strange and alluring woman named Emma, a talented artist who has been chasing her dreams of fame but feels disenchanted by the superficiality of the art world. Realizing they both share a love for the night sky, they decide to embark on an adventure to witness the unique celestial event – the appearance of a once-in-a-lifetime comet. With every mile, their bond grows stronger as they discover an inexplicable connection to the cosmos. Act 2: As the comet draws nearer, Alex and Emma find themselves grappling with their own inner demons, desires, and past regrets while uncovering unimaginable secrets about the comet itself. They learn that the cosmic wanderer holds the key to changing one pivotal moment in their lives, thus offering a chance to rewrite history and seek redemption. Torn between seizing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the consequences of altering their destiny, they grapple with difficult choices, ultimately realizing that they have the power to not only transform their own lives but the lives of others as well. Act 3: On the day of the comet, Alex and Emma make the monumental decision to embrace their newfound potential and explore the world together, not as strangers but as companions. They decide to use the comet's power not to reshape their individual pasts but to create an unforgettable and extraordinary shared future. As they stare into the night sky hand-in-hand, the dazzling beauty of the comet above reflects the transformative love and adventure that lies before them. The answer to how many times they should see this movie in a lifetime is, fittingly, once - much like the comet's rare and mysterious journey. In the end, 'Once in a Lifetime' leaves viewers with a lasting message about the importance of self-discovery, the power of connection, and the beauty of embracing the unknown. It is a story that inspires us to cherish the magical, fleeting moments that life has to offer and serves as a reminder to open our hearts to the wonders of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is the density of an object having a mass of 5.0g and a volume of 45.0 cm^3? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"Let's answer the questions one by one: 1. What is the density of an object with mass 9.03g and a volume of 0.1987mL? To determine the density of an object, we use the formula: Density (ρ) = Mass (m) / Volume (V) In this case, the mass (m) is 9.03 grams, and the volume (V) is 0.1987 milliliters. To calculate the density, we plug the values into the formula: ρ = 9.03g / 0.1987mL ρ ≈ 45.40 g/mL So, the density of this object is approximately 45.40 grams per milliliter. 2. What is the density of an object having a mass of 5.0g and a volume of 45.0 cm^3? Again, we'll use the formula: Density (ρ) = Mass (m) / Volume (V) In this case, the mass (m) is 5.0 grams, and the volume (V) is 45.0 cm^3. Since the volume is given in cubic centimeters, we should convert it into milliliters for consistency. Since 1 cm^3 is equal to 1 mL, there's no need for conversion: ρ = 5.0g / 45.0mL ρ ≈ 0.111 g/mL So, the density of this object is approximately 0.111 grams per milliliter. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options:  1). no;  2). yes; The answer is 1). no. The questions do not have the same meaning because they are asking to find the density of objects with different masses and volumes. Although they both inquire about density, the specific values are different, resulting in different densities for each object."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who wears a priestly collar for security?  The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. \\"Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!\\" she says, and shows her the way after tea. At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it. Stephanie explains there isn't any church, and no \\"Reverend Alan Bax\\"—but that the pretence is completely harmless. Alan shows Gwen the old church, now a ruin, as he walks her home. He confesses to her that he is not really a priest—\\"I wanted to enter the Church, but I failed.\\" He notes that he does not try to persuade anyone or officiate, but sometimes wears the priestly collar \\"for security.\\" Gwen tries to find out more about why the old church was left a ruin but Alan mysteriously turns silent and seems to be unable to move, so she says good night and leaves him to his thoughts.

The long strait divides the island of Karmøy on the west and the mainland of Norway and island of Vestre Bokn in the east. The strait runs through the municipalities of Haugesund, Karmøy, and Bokn. The town of Haugesund lies at the northern end of the strait and the town of Kopervik lies in the central part of the strait, and the village of Skudeneshavn lies near the southern end where the strait flows into the Boknafjorden. The Karmsund Bridge, a part of the European route E134 highway, links Karmøy to the mainland. The bridge was completed in 1955. The small islands of Vibrandsøy, Risøy, and Hasseløy lie in the strait at the northern end, just off shore from the town of Haugesund.  - Avaldsnes is a village in Karmøy municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located on the northeastern part of the island of Karmøy, along the Karmsundet strait, just south of the town of Haugesund. The village was an ancient centre of power on the west coast of Norway and is the site of one of Norways more important areas of cultural history. The trading port of Notow and the Avaldsnes Church are two notable historic sites in Avaldsnes.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - Location. The town is situated on a strategically important sound, the Karmsundet, through which ships could pass without traversing heavy seas. In the early years, the coastal waters off Haugesund were a huge source of herring, and the town grew accordingly. Despite being barely a village back then, King Harald Fairhair lived at Avaldsnes, very close to the modern town of Haugesund. In the last decades, the town, like its neighbours, has been turning towards the petroleum industry, with the herring being long gone.  - Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Hárfagri\\", Norwegian: \\"Harald Hårfagre\\", (literally \\"Harald Hair-fair\\") ;  850   932) is remembered by medieval historians as the first King of Norway. According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he reigned from  872 to 930. Most of his life remains uncertain, since the extant accounts of his life in the sagas were set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime. A few remnants of skaldic praise poems attributed to contemporary court poets exist which seem to refer to Harald's victories against opponents in Norway. The information supplied in these poems is inconsistent with the tales in the sagas in which they are transmitted, and the sagas themselves often disagree on the details of his background and biography. Two of his sons, Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, succeeded Harald to become kings after his death.  - Fotballklubben Haugesund is a Norwegian football club from the city of Haugesund .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would fork A needed John to move it more or less quickly than fork B?  John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude.  Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) The answer to this question is:","output":"Fork A would need John to move it more quickly than fork B. The reason for this is that fork A produces a higher frequency compared to fork B. As hinted, the frequency of a wave is directly related to the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. In order to generate a higher-frequency wave, one must move the source (in this case, the tuning fork) faster. Therefore, to achieve the higher frequency produced by fork A, John would need to move it more quickly than fork B, which produces a lower frequency. Since more energy is required to generate higher-frequency waves, fork A, with the same amplitude as fork B, indeed has more energy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jaguars' Wembley trip just one more step on Blake Bortles' fantastic journey Blake Bortles wasn’t supposed to be starting for Jacksonville against the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley on Sunday. In fact, he wasn’t supposed to be anywhere near London at all. But then he wasn’t supposed to have been picked third in this year’s NFL draft, been MVP of the Fiesta Bowl against Baylor in January or even been playing for the University of Central Florida last year. Then again, he was passed over by every SEC university coming out of little Oviedo High School near Orlando in Florida, where he was a reluctant quarterback and the school was also initially hesitant to make him its centrepiece. In fact, the 22-year-old has rarely been the one who was supposed to do anything in particular at any point, yet he has always been “The One” once all the dust has settled. In that respect, he is a perfect fit for the Jaguars and, if both parties have the patience to endure the growing pains – the team are 1-8 for the season – the long-term prognosis is extremely positive. Just ask one of his former head coaches, George O’Leary at UCF. He says: “Blake is a kid who takes things in his stride, learning from everything as he goes. He is mature, has great poise and never gets unsettled. He has all the physical attributes you could want at 6ft 5in and maintains an even keel, never too high or too low.” O’Leary admits it took Bortles half of his sophomore year, having been a redshirt freshman, before he really “got it”, but then his growth curve was exponential, finishing his first full season as MVP of the 2012 Beef O’Brady’s Bowl against Ball State and going on to a stellar junior year highlighted by wins at Penn State, Louisville and Temple, an American Athletic Conference (AAC) championship and the big underdog moment of victory over Baylor in the Fiesta Bowl. It was a similar experience at Oviedo High, where a tall young linebacker was virtually press-ganged into service as a quarterback in his sophomore year, running a limited wing-T offence. When it was clear Bortles could handle a lot more than repeated hand-offs to a running back, the coach changed the system around him. By the time he finished his senior year, he had amassed a Seminole County record of 5,576 passing yards and 53 touchdowns. “He’s going to continue to try to get better at everything he does,” says Oviedo coach Wes Allen. “He’s not a kid who sits back and says ‘I’ve got it all. I’ve arrived.’ He’ll do everything in his power to make that franchise a better team. He’ll be the one who sits all night and studies the film and learns the protections and gets with the linemen and receivers. Blake has a great personality so people want to follow him, be around him, believe in him, not because he’s loud and boisterous, but because he puts in the work, and people see that. Bortles’ high school work did not attract a lot of attention. He visited seven SEC universities, but none were interested in an “unpolished” quarterback. Only UCF and Western Kentucky made full scholarship offers; Colorado State, Purdue and Tulane also wanted him, but as a tight end. “It just made him work harder,” says his dad, Rob Bortles. “He is a great competitor and the lack of recognition was just fuel for his competitive spirit. And he did everything on his own – if he felt he needed to work on something, he went out and did it himself. He initially had to compete with Jeff Godfrey for the starting role and even after UCF beat Ball State there was no conversation about what he might go on to do. Then he started his junior year and everything changed.” In the same way as his junior year at Oviedo High was the “learning experience” for a spectacular senior season, so his university sophomore year became the forerunner to a notable coming out party in the inaugural AAC campaign. Bortles threw for 3,581 yards and 25 touchdowns, running in another six and finishing with a 163.4 quarterback rating, while UCF chalked up a school record 12 wins and their highest ranking, No10. On the recommendation of several observers, Bortles petitioned the NFL for a draft “grade”, the system by which the professional ranks judge university talent and allow players to assess their potential worth. “It came back as a first-round grade,” recalls Rob. “It was the hardest decision he had to make because it would mean leaving a bunch of guys he had grown up with and he was worried about letting them down. “They were supposed to be the senior class together, ready to take UCF to another level, and Blake felt he owed it to them to stick together. But he had a first-round NFL grade. So I asked him how he would feel if somebody else on the team had the same opportunity he now had, and he said he’d tell them to go for it. So he did.” After Bortles declared for the draft, almost every team worked him out at the NFL Combine. He spent nearly eight weeks in Carlsbad, California, with veteran quarterback Jordan Palmer, working on his mechanics in a bid to add more polish to the “physical attributes” most pundits mentioned. In the quarterback class of 2014, he was initially listed behind Johnny Manziel and Teddy Bridgewater. But the more coaches talked to him, the more they liked what they heard. He didn’t carry a fancy moniker like “Johnny Football” or hail from a football-rich programme like Louisville, where Bridgewater was touted as a No1 pick. (He went 32nd, to the Vikings.) But Bortles’ even-keeled, can-do approach and sheer robustness began to change opinions as draft day approached. He, however, still had little clue where his future lay. His dad explains: “We had absolutely no idea what would happen at the draft. We were sat at one of the back tables in the green room, with the likes of Manziel and Jadeveon Clowney up front. Blake’s agent was talking to teams, trying to figure it out, but five minutes before the draft, Jacksonville were talking about going in another direction. “If that was the case, it was supposed to be Cleveland at No24. Clowney duly went No1 and then Greg Robinson was taken by the Rams – and Blake’s phone rang. I said to my wife, ‘What’s he on the phone for? Doesn’t he know someone might call?’ And she said, ‘Yes, it’s Jacksonville. He’s the No3 pick.’ Which just goes to show no-one really knows what’s going to happen. The players are all told ‘Hug your mum’ as the first thing after the phone call, but the cameras were still on Robinson when Blake hugged Suzy and me, and then his girlfriend, and Jordan Palmer, and by the time the cameras got to him, he was hugging his agent, and everyone just went ‘Why’s he hugging his agent first?’ It was a crazy period. From being “The Quarterback Who Wasn’t Supposed To Be Chosen First”, Bortles made the short journey up the Florida coast to find he was also “The Quarterback Who Wasn’t Supposed To Start In His First Season”. Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley was adamant his new acquisition should sit out his first season, another “redshirt year”. It would buck the trend of recent highly-drafted signal callers, the majority of whom have been required to justify their high salaries from day one, but it would potentially put Bortles on track to gain valuable experience without being right in the firing line. He put in a respectable preseason’s work and there was a predictable clamour to have him start straight away when Bradley named journeyman Chad Henne as his starting quarterback, but the Jacksonville strategy was clear – give Bortles a year to learn and he would be ready to fire on all cylinders in 2015. That plan lasted all of two and a half games. With the Jags down 30-0 at halftime to Indianapolis in their first home outing, Bradley sent the first-round pick out after the interval. A new era was born. Like his idol Brett Favre, Bortles was in at the deep end in his third game with his new team and, like the Green Bay legend, the story since has been a mix of touchdown passes (eight) and interceptions (13). Jacksonville remain painfully thin for experienced talent and the growing pains are evident in almost every direction. Bortles has been sacked 19 times, which puts him in the top 10 of most abused NFL quarterbacks, and he is on course to equal Peyton Manning’s debut season for interceptions (28). The Jaguars have been competitive in all but one of Bortles’ six starts, though, and it is now, in London this week and in the final third of the regular season, that we will see if he can repeat his successful learning curve from Oviedo High and UCF, and show if he is supposed to be on this stage. Rob Bortles has no doubts. The family dynamic is clearly a supportive one, cultivated through years of junior sports travel and competitiveness with younger brother Colby – “We don’t have a dining-room table,” says Rob, “We have a ping-pong table. Everything is a competition between those two, even to see who can finish dinner first!” Between them, Rob and Suzy drove the boys thousands of miles around the south-east for football or baseball, and they all thrived on their sporting instincts. Rob was also a noted high school linebacker and wrestler while Suzy played softball. Rose-coloured glasses are not part of the family accoutrements, though, and therefore Rob believes his son’s basic character traits, which served him so well through high school and college, will surface again. No-one will out-work Blake. It is his passion and has been his dream since he was a kid. I know he is up at 5.30 some mornings to get in to practice. We call him ‘The Grinder’ – he just keeps working at something until he cracks it. “Yes, he’s going to throw his share of interceptions but a lot of those are correctable as he learns from his mistakes, and he has a great coaching set-up at Jacksonville. Everyone is unfailingly positive and they all buy into that ethos. Despite the losses this season, everyone remains focused on the plan and they have so much young talent, that, if they do all stick it out together, they have a great future.” If that is the view from the outside – albeit from an insider on the outside – it makes sense to test the temperature on the inside, too, via Bortles himself. Twenty-two is still young in the NFL – the only younger starting quarterback is Minnesota’s Bridgewater, at 21 – but to talk to Bortles is to listen to a vastly more mature, tuned-in personality, at once aware of his own shortcomings to date but unfazed by the task ahead, equable yet determined. He says: “Obviously there have been a lot of mistakes and a lot of learning opportunities, and it takes time to recognise that everybody is a lot faster on defence, but so are the guys you are throwing to, so I feel the learning curve balances out. It is up to me to get the offence in the right position and move the ball consistently, and we have been able to do that really well these past couple of weeks, although we’ve also had some breakdowns that have cost us points. As long as you learn from them, the experience isn’t wasted. It is also cool to be going through this learning process as a group and, while we have a good mix, with some older guys who are all leaders, we do have a bunch of young guys who are starting in their rookie or second year and going through this together. The results are not what we want but we are getting better and you couldn’t want for a more enjoyable environment than Jacksonville. OK, so there may be a touch of youthful naivety in that last statement – not many players would list north-east Florida among their top places to be – but ultimately, it is no wonder Bradley pulled the plug on Plan A and went to Plan Bortles after only three games. While comparisons to Favre and Buffalo’s Jim Kelly abound, the kid from Oviedo is a true individual who inspires with deeds not words, who takes the team ethic to heart and buys in completely to the “learn and improve” approach. It will certainly be in evidence at Wembley on Sunday, when the contrast with the ego-driven Cowboys will be palpable. Bortles and the Jaguars aren’t supposed to win, you know, but then he’s been hearing that for much of his young life. It hasn’t stopped him yet.

If every number in the input list is even an empty list should be returned. Zero should be counted as an even number.

This meets the criteria of being a list of numbers as all elements within the square brackets are numerical and separated by commas. Part #2: Identifying even numbers Usage: Once the list is provided, the task requires identification of even numbers. These are numbers divisible by 2. For example, from the input list, 186, 36, 28, 194, 152, 192 are all even numbers as they can be divided by 2 with no remainder. Part #3: Removing even numbers Usage: After identifying even numbers, you need to remove them from the list. After removing 186, 36, 28, 194, 152, 192 from the original list, the list would look like this: [173, 9, 123, 29]. This meets the criteria because my new list only contains Odd numbers. Part #4: Handling lists with all even numbers Usage: In situations where every number in the list is even, this task requires returning an empty list. For instance, if the input list was [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], following the instructions will yield an empty list: []. This meets the criteria as all the numbers in the original list were even, and thus were all removed.  Part #5: Categorizing zero as an even number Usage: In this task, zero is categorized as an even number, and therefore should be removed from the list if included. For example, if the original list were [0, 1, 3, 5], after removing the even number (0 in this case), the list would be [1, 3, 5].

Question: Information:  - A recumbent bicycle is a bicycle that places the rider in a laid-back reclining position. Most recumbent riders choose this type of design for ergonomic reasons; the rider's weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area, supported by back and buttocks. On a traditional upright bicycle, the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the sitting bones, the feet, and the hands.  - The land speed record (or absolute land speed record) is the highest speed achieved by a person using a vehicle on land. There is no single body for validation and regulation; in practice the Category C (\\"Special Vehicles\\") flying start regulations are used, officiated by regional or national organizations under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The land speed record (LSR) is standardized as the speed over a course of fixed length, averaged over two runs (commonly called \\"passes\\"). Two runs are required in opposite directions within one hour, and a new record mark must exceed the previous one by at least one percent to be validated. There are numerous other class records for cars; motorcycles fall into a separate class.  - The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA, English: International Automobile Federation) is an association established as the \\"Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus\\" (AIACR, English: 'International Association of Recognized Automobile Clubs') on 20 June 1904 to represent the interests of motoring organisations and motor car users. To the general public, the FIA is mostly known as the governing body for many auto racing events. The FIA also promotes road safety around the world.  - The JCB Dieselmax is a diesel - engined ' streamliner ' car designed for the purpose of breaking the land speed record for a diesel - engined vehicle . The car was built for JCB , a British multinational equipment company . As of 2014 , the car holds the world diesel - powered land speed record , having been driven to over 350 miles per hour ( 560 km / h ) by Wing Commander Andy Green in 2006 .  - Streamline Moderne, or Art Moderne, is a late type of the Art Deco architecture and design that emerged in the 1930s. Its architectural style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements.  - A streamliner is a vehicle incorporating streamlining in a shape providing reduced air resistance. The term is applied to high-speed railway trainsets of the 1930s to 1950s, and to their successor \\"bullet trains\\". Less commonly, the term is applied to fully faired recumbent bicycles. As part of the Streamline Moderne trend, the term was applied to passenger cars, trucks, and other types of light-, medium-, or heavy-duty vehicles, but now vehicle streamlining is so prevalent that it is not an outstanding characteristic. In land speed racing, it is a term applied to the long, slender, custom built, high-speed vehicles with enclosed wheels.  - High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of and existing lines in excess of are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'jcb dieselmax' exhibits the relationship of 'subclass of'. Find the answer from the choices below.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. News article: CBC.ca - Arts - Film - End of an Era What were we talking about?: Todd Jackson (Ralph Fiennes) and Sofia (Natasha Richardson) in The White Countess. Courtesy Mongrel Media. Over the last 44 years, director James Ivory and his recently deceased life partner, producer Ismail Merchant, built one of the most recognizable brands in modern cinema. Their newest and final collaboration, The White Countess, concerns a blind American (Ralph Fiennes) and a Russian aristocrat (Natasha Richardson, never better, never more radiant) who open a nightclub amid the turbulence of 1930s Shanghai. Merchant Ivoryâs valedictory effort shows off their usual strengths: the film is pretty to look at and employs top British actors in all the key roles. The White Countess is as good a picture as the couple has produced in years; nonetheless, it marks the end of a franchise that was better at atmosphere than it was at storytelling, better at producing a marketable type of beauty than competent films. Merchant was born in Bombay, Ivory hailed from Berkeley, Calif.; both shared an acute case of anglophilia, distilling a nostalgic vision of Englishness. Merchant and Ivory began making art-house films in the U.K. in the early 1960s and broke through in North America in 1985, with A Room with a View; based on the novel by E.M. Forster, it told the story of a young English gentlewoman (Helena Bonham Carter) whose passions are unleashed by a trip to Italy. Merchant Ivoryâs depiction of England was one of sun-soaked barley fields and ancient oak trees, bespectacled literary fops wearing bespoke suits (Daniel Day-Lewis in Room) and intrepid spinster travellers in free-flowing skirts and high-collared blouses (Judi Dench in Room). This hoary vision annoyed many Britons, while enchanting North Americans. Merchant Ivory hired many young, talented English actors, many of whom have gone on to busy international careers (most notably Day-Lewis, Bonham Carter, Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves). Merchant and Ivory chose to depict pre-First World War Britain so glowingly because they loathed what the country has become. âEngland has been inherited by the lower classes who talk about making money and football,â Merchant once told Londonâs Sunday Telegraph. âAn Englishman's word is no longer his bond.â Where the grass is always greener: From left, George Emerson (Julian Sands), Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Lucy Honeychurch (Helen Bonham Carter) in Room with a View. Courtesy Warner Home Video. In the final analysis, Merchant and Ivory are the Crabtree & Evelyn of filmmaking. Liking Merchant Ivory films has become akin to enjoying tennis or classical music. Never mind that you havenât seen a Merchant Ivory film — or watched an entire tennis match or sat through a symphony — in years; you identified yourself long ago as the sort of person who likes Merchant Ivory movies, and youâre sticking to it. Despite having produced only a handful of decent films (and many barking dogs), the duo succeeded in making their double-barrelled name a latter-day shibboleth. Fans are part of an international tribe of like-minded individuals: well-educated, sensitive and, more than anything else, upper crust (or, at least, aspiring to be upper crust). âDo you like Merchant Ivory?â has become a question much like Aimez-vous Brahms? — a reference to a FranÃ§oise Sagan novel that wonât be wasted on Merchant Ivory lovers. Their films usually have plots that float about aimlessly and dialogue that rings false and pretentious. (Much of the blame for this rests with Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who wrote the scripts for 23 of the films.) Although the movies are informed by an effortless cultural sophistication, they lack a parallel political sophistication and get downright clumsy whenever they try to approach public issues. Merchant Ivory productions attempt to escape from the hurly-burly; they are about waking up from the nightmare of history, rather than engaging with it. Case in point: the execrable (and typical) Jefferson in Paris (1995). Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) comes to Paris as the American ambassador and promptly falls for an artsy Englishwoman (Greta Scacchi). As the affair gains steam, so does the revolutionary movement. The filmmakers drop in a few hilariously decorous riots here and there, between aristocratic soirÃ©es, but they are made to seem beside the point. (Commoners don't get much screen time in Merchant Ivory flicks.) Meanwhile, Nolte and Scacchi, a pair of accomplished acting pros, gamely wade through spectacularly wooden dialogue: He: âYou appear all clarity and light, of this world, not the next.â She: âIt is true I was born in the sun and I can't live without it.â Enter Thandie Newton, as Jeffersonâs slave, Sally Hemmings, who has to play at once a budding heroine of the freedom movement and an insipid, yessuh-Massah housegirl. As the film goes on, Sally gradually supplants the Englishwoman in her masterâs affections. Revolving wildly around this love triangle are Jefferson's intolerant daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow, more lumpen than usual), who may convert to Catholicism; Marie-Antoinette, playing at being a dairy maid; a hypnotist who puts hysterical courtiers under; and Monsieur Guillotin, who demonstrates a model of his decapitation device at a dinner party. Big wigs: Richard Cosway (Simon Callow) and Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi) in Jefferson in Paris. Courtesy Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. In short, the film is a mess. The characters are incoherent. One moment, Jefferson is a sneaky sex-hound, the next a high-minded idealist; he never feels at all human. The projectâs politics are muddled: Jeffersonâs views on slavery are even more confused than the historical record reveals. Plus, the filmmakers donât even let Greta Scacchi have a ripped-bodice sex scene, which is like giving Pavarotti a non-singing part. Merchant and Ivory did, however, bring certain second-tier strengths to all their work: an impressionist's visual sensibility, a fashion historianâs love of period finery and a real appreciation of literary classics written in the understated Edwardian vein. Their best films â The Forster trio of A Room With a View, Maurice (1987) and Howards End (1992), as well as the neo-Edwardian The Remains of the Day (1993) — provoke a sort of restful ease, the aah of coming into an art gallery, which is rare enough to be welcome. Right from the credit sequences in these films, we feel that we are in a civilized space; not even Greta Scacchi would dare disrobe here. These films all dramatize the struggle to overcome repression, to come out (as whatever you are). In the 1980s and early 1990s, these period pieces spoke to a society at the tail end of the battle against repression. In their subtle way, the films contributed to this last great push for freer self-expression, which largely accounts for their popularity among suburban bohemians. Twenty years later, with everyone out (as whatever they are), the message seems quaint and irrelevant. Weâve jettisoned our repressed upbringings; now what? The films end where our real lives now begin. Perhaps Merchant Ivoryâs greatest contribution has been recognizing and championing literary talent. But if their book picks are generally first rate, theyâve often failed to translate good novels into quality films. The Forster books, as well as Kazuo Ishiguroâs The Remains of the Day, were easy adaptations: both writers pen naturalistic, evocative dialogue and situate their characters in picturesque locales. The franchise invariably made a hash of harder-to-transmute works, utterly squelching the bright airiness of Diane Johnsonâs comedy of manners, Le Divorce (2003), and getting lost in Henry Jamesâs labyrinthine prose in The Bostonians (1984) and The Golden Bowl (2000). Thankfully, the script for The White Countess comes from Ishiguro, one of the most disciplined writers at work today. (He based the story very loosely on Junichiro Tanizakiâs novel The Diary of a Mad Old Man, as well as his own grandfatherâs stories of 1930s Shanghai.) The American diplomat played by Fiennes loses his family and his eyesight in a terrorist attack. Understandably embittered, he leaves affairs of state behind to open the nightclub the White Countess, which, like a Merchant Ivory film, offers a getaway from the rough-and-tumble world outside. At one point in the film, the well-dressed, distinguished American sits on a barstool, sighing reflectively. âOut there,â he says, âthere is chaos, mistrust, deceit.â This is an economical description of the raw materials of real drama. Sadly, Merchant Ivoryâs films never could deal with such messy stuff. In the movie, the nightclub has a good run, but must close when the Japanese invade the city. The White Countess is certainly a stylish place to hang out, but, in a real crisis, it shuts down. It doesnât serve up the good, stiff drink you need.

Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Part 1: Arturo XuncaxThe first part takes place in a small rural Guatemalan village called San Pedro and introduces the Xuncax family, a group of indigenous Mayans. Arturo is a coffee picker and his wife a homemaker. Arturo explains to his son, Enrique, his world view and how the indio fares in Guatemalan life, noting that, \\"to the rich, the peasant is just a pair of strong arms\\". Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where \\"all the people, even the poor, own their own cars\\". Because of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray them... Arturo's severed head is seen hanging from a tree. When Enrique attempts to climb the tree that displays his father's head, a soldier attacks him. Enrique fights and kills the attacker, only to learn that many of their fellow villagers have been rounded up by soldiers. The children's mother too \\"disappears\\": abducted by soldiers.

Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which class of animals would have better separation of  oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B?  Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Answer:","output":"Class A animals, which comprise reptiles, would have better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. This is due to the fact that reptiles have a more developed septum in their heart, which more effectively separates the two types of bloodstreams compared to amphibians. This adaptation allows for a more efficient respiratory system and helps reptiles better draw air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now Movie plot: Set in the turn of the 20th century, the film focuses on Joseph E. Howard, an aspiring songwriter who happily sells a song to performer Lulu Madison, who later takes sole credit for the writing. He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite. Thinking that she can use Joe's talent for her career, she invites him to serve as her personal piano player on her tour. He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show. Sometime later, Joe finds out Katie is working under the stage name Pat O'Dare, performing 'I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now', an unpublished song by Joe. Katie is surprised to see him, and they eventually kiss each other.

At its peak, the empire included significant portions of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. The heart of the Ottoman Empire was located in modern-day Turkey. Its capital city was originally Bursa before it was moved to Edirne (formerly known as Adrianople) and later to Istanbul (formerly known as Constantinople/Byzantium), which served as the empire's capital from 1453 until its dissolution in 1922. Throughout its history, the empire expanded and contracted across different territories.

Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus. *SPOILERS* The end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. However, the film doesn't even follow through with this. Instead, the drawn out scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of either regret or \\"This didn't fix anything\\" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background. My problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? Do we feel Dawson's moment of regretful clarity?

Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out  the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity  and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer  because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship.

How do you do this: To score a strike in bowling,","output":"Scoring a strike in bowling requires a combination of skill, technique, and understanding of the game's rules and scoring system. A strike is achieved when a bowler successfully knocks down all ten pins with the first ball of a frame (the first of two opportunities in each turn). Here is a step-by-step guide to help you score a strike in bowling: 1. Choose the right ball: Find a suitable bowling ball that fits your hand comfortably and provides a good grip. The holes should be neither too tight nor too loose. The ideal weight of the ball will depend on your strength and comfort level but typically ranges between 10-16 pounds for adults. 2. Develop a consistent approach: Establish a consistent starting position on the approach area (the part of the lane where you take your steps before releasing the ball), usually about 4-5 steps away from the foul line (the line you must not cross when releasing the ball). Most bowlers use a four or five-step approach, but it ultimately depends on what feels most comfortable and natural for you. 3. Visualize your target: Before starting your approach, look down the lane and visualize your target. In bowling, the pins are numbered, and you may want to aim for the space between the 1st (headpin) and either the 2nd or 3rd pin, commonly referred to as the pocket. Hitting the pocket increases the chances of scoring a strike. 4. Proper footwork and timing: As you begin your approach, your footwork should be smooth and well-timed. Focus on maintaining a good balance and rhythm throughout the steps leading up to the release. The penultimate step is called the slide, where the bowler glides up to the foul line to release the ball smoothly. 5. Develop a consistent swing: Your arm swing should be consistent and fluid. Keep your arm close to your body throughout the swing, and allow the bowling ball's weight to guide the motion. To generate the proper backswing, let the ball swing back naturally instead of muscling it back or lifting it. As you transition into your downswing, maintain a free and relaxed arm motion that leads to a smooth release. 6. Release and follow-through: As you reach the foul line, release the ball by allowing your fingers to exit the ball first, followed by your thumb. Make sure you maintain good balance and control over your hand position, as this will affect the ball's spin and trajectory. A proper follow-through is crucial to ensuring the ball travels in the intended direction. Extend your arm and fingers towards your target and hold the position for a moment to boost accuracy. 7. Analyze and adjust: Even professional bowlers don't achieve strikes every time, so it's essential to learn from each throw and make the necessary adjustments. If your ball consistently misses the pocket or leaves pins standing, consider adjusting your starting position, target, speed, or spin as necessary. Practicing frequently will help improve your skills and increase your chances of scoring strikes consistently. Remember that achieving a strike is only one part of the overall game of bowling. To become a proficient bowler, focus on developing a consistent approach, swing, and release, while also learning about the game's rules, scoring system, and various strategies for adjusting to different lane conditions and situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here are possible answers to this question: - college campus - players - high school - texas - oklahoma  I believe the correct choice is \\"college campus\\", here's why: A:","output":"The given question is: \\"There would be over a hundred thousand people at the football field that weekend, it was the most popular spot on the what?\\" The possible answers provided are: 1. college campus 2. players 3. high school 4. texas 5. oklahoma To answer this question, I will now analyze each choice step-by-step: 1. College campus: This option seems plausible because football games are typically a major attraction on college campuses. Universities often host games that draw thousands of fans, students, and alumni. 2. Players: This option doesn't make sense because players are the ones who participate in the game and are not the place where football games occur. 3. High school: While high school football games can attract a significant number of attendees, it is unlikely that there would be over a hundred thousand people in attendance at a high school football game. 4. Texas: This option is not logical because Texas is a state, not a specific location like a football field. 5. Oklahoma: Similar to Texas, this option is not relevant as Oklahoma is a state and the given context does not specify a location within the state. After a step-by-step analysis, I believe the correct choice is \\"college campus\\" because it is the most appropriate and relevant answer based on the given context. Football games typically attract large crowds, and college campuses are known for hosting these events. The other options do not provide a suitable context for the football field being the most popular spot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A week or 2 before the first freeze of the season, cover your planted peonies with mulch. You can use a commercial mulch if you’d like, but weeds, straw, pine needles, sawdust and grass will work just fine. Cover each of your planting sites with a 4–6 in (10–15 cm) layer of your preferred mulching material.  While peonies certainly need cold weather to grow, you don’t want the roots themselves to freeze too quickly or for too long. Mulching the soil insulates it and ensures that the soil won’t freeze and thaw repeatedly through the season. Most peonies need around 400-hours of exposure of near-freezing temperatures in the winter to bloom completely in the summer. You do not need to mulch peonies that you’re storing indoors. Indoor peonies do not require as many freezing hours, since their root systems won’t get that big anyway. Keep your pot near a chilly window during the winter months. As spring starts, wait for the temperature to consistently rise above 32 °F (0 °C). Once it has been above freezing for a few weeks, remove the mulch from your plant. Use a shovel or throw on some thick gloves and scrape it off the top of the soil. If you accidentally scrape away some of the top soil, go ahead and replace it. Get a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen from your local gardening store. As spring progresses, you’ll soon notice stems sticking out of the ground. When the stems get to be around 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) high, sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons (15-20 g) of fertilizer into the soil and mix it with your top soil by hand or with a trowel. You may not see any stems emerge from the soil for the first 1-2 years. Over the course of the first 2 years, you may not notice much progress with your peonies. Peonies can live over 25 years, but they take a while to get going. During the first 2 years, water your plants every other week to ensure that the soil retains moisture and the roots get some water. Apply a soft stream of water to the top soil for 5-6 seconds when you go to water the rest of your garden.  You do not need to water your peonies in the winter. You can water less frequently once stems begin to grow. If your flower is going to bloom on a given year, you’ll notice the stems in early-to-mid spring. Once you notice your flowers growing, water them once every 3-4 weeks. Peonies are pretty easy to care for after the first few years, and it’s particularly hard to starve them of water since their root systems are so efficient. Give them a few seconds of water by spraying around the stem of the plant once your peonies have grown. Peonies typically bloom around April or May. The blooms may only last a few weeks, but they’ll be back next year! Once your plants start to wither, you need to trim them down to avoid starving the roots. Grab a set of garden shears a week before the first freeze of the winter season. Cut your flowers down until there are only 3 inches (7.6 cm) of stem remaining  near the soil. Mulch the soil and repeat the process to ensure that your flowers come back next year. You can prune your plant to remove dead bulbs if you’d like, but peonies typically don’t require much (if any) pruning. The biggest predators when it comes to peonies are blight, rot, and fungus. If you ever notice discolored fungus or dark rot setting into your plants, trim them down to the topsoil and discard the damaged portions of each plant. Wait for a year to allow the winter frost to kill any remnants of the disease.  Peonies tend to be very resilient when it comes to insects and illness. If you ever have a year where your plants seem sickly, the winter will freeze away most of the common offenders and your plants will grow back beautifully next year. You may notice ants feeding on the flowers when they bloom. Don’t worry about the ants, they can’t permanently damage the plant and won’t cause very much trouble—they’re only there for the secretions that come out of the flowers.","output":"The article provides detailed instructions on how to properly care for peonies, including mulching, fertilizing, watering, and pruning techniques, as well as addressing potential issues with diseases and pests to ensure healthy growth and beautiful blooms each year."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

They are the only remaining Hindu community native to the Kashmir Valley.  - Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term \\"Kashmir\\" denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (subdivided into Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh divisions), the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.   - Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (18 August 1900  1 December 1990) was an Indian diplomat and politician, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the aunt of Indira Gandhi and the grand-aunt of Rajiv Gandhi, each of whom served as Prime Minister of India. Pandit was sent to London, as India's most important diplomat, after serving as Nehrus envoy to the Soviet Union, the USA and the United Nations.

The Prime Minister is also the chief adviser to the President of India and head of the Council of Ministers. He or she can be a member of any of the two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha), but has to be the leader of the political party, having a majority in the Lok Sabha.  - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869  30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: \\"high-souled\\", \\"venerable\\")applied to him first in 1914 in South Africais now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for \\"father\\", \\"papa\\") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.  - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917  31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father.  Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India.  - Jawaharlal Nehru (14 November 1889  27 May 1964) was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence. He emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964.

He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

During the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, internal borders were redrawn by the Allied military governments. No single state comprised more than 30% of either population or territory; this was intended to prevent any one state from being as dominant within Germany as Prussia had been in the past. Initially, only seven of the pre-War states remained: Baden (in part), Bavaria (reduced in size), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (enlarged), Saxony, and Thuringia. The states with hyphenated names, such as Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony-Anhalt, owed their existence to the occupation powers and were created out of mergers of former Prussian provinces and smaller states. Former German territory that lie east of the Oder-Neisse Line fell under either Polish or Soviet administration but attempts were made at least symbolically not to abandon sovereignty well into the 1960s. However, no attempts were made to establish new states in these territories as they lay outside the jurisdiction of West Germany at that time. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who redrew internal borders after WW I?","output":"The redrawing of internal borders after World War I was largely done by the victorious Allied powers, particularly during the negotiations in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The Treaty of Versailles and other treaties established new borders and created several new states, primarily from territories taken from the defeated nations of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire.

Answer:","output":"Remy, like many individuals who leave their rural homes for urban settings, could have made this decision due to a multitude of reasons. While I cannot speak for Remy's specific motivations without more context, I will provide a detailed list of potential factors that might have influenced his decision to move to the city. 1. Job opportunities: The city often offers more job opportunities and a wider range of industries compared to rural areas. Remy may have been seeking better employment prospects or career advancements that were unavailable on the farm. Urban settings also create a strong network of professionals, leading to greater collaboration and innovation opportunities. 2. Education: Access to higher education institutions is typically easier in cities, as they host several universities and vocational schools. If Remy was looking to pursue further studies or gain additional qualifications, moving closer to these establishments could have been an attractive incentive. 3. Better infrastructure and public services: In terms of transportation, healthcare, and municipal services, cities typically have better-funded and more comprehensive offerings. Remy may have been drawn to more reliable public transportation options, improved access to healthcare facilities, or the availability of various public programs and amenities. 4. Cultural attractions and entertainment: Cities often boast a rich array of cultural institutions, such as museums, theaters, and galleries. Additionally, the endless variety of restaurants, bars, clubs, and other entertainment venues can provide residents with numerous social opportunities and experiences. It is possible that Remy was seeking a more vibrant and engaging social life. 5. Diversity and cosmopolitanism: Cities attract residents from various backgrounds, forming multicultural and cosmopolitan communities. For someone like Remy who lived on a farm, the allure of meeting new people and learning about different cultures might have been a strong incentive to move. 6. Independence and personal growth: Leaving the familiarity of a rural environment and immersing oneself in an urban setting can provide opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery. Remy might have felt a strong desire to challenge himself and expand his horizons. 7. Fatigue from farm life: As you mentioned, Remy was tired of all the work on the farm. Farming involves long hours of hard, physical labor and can be both mentally and physically exhausting. Remy may have been seeking a change of pace and respite from the demands of farm work. 8. Family or social influence: Remy might have been influenced by friends, family, or loved ones who encouraged him to move to the city. Hearing about the experiences of others who have made a similar transition can often be a motivating factor. In summary, there are several factors that could have influenced Remy's decision to move to the city, such as better job opportunities, education, modern infrastructure, cultural attractions, diversity, personal growth, exhaustion from farm work, or the encouragement of family and friends. It is likely that a combination of these elements played a role in shaping Remy's choice to leave the farm behind and seek a new life in the city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What does a person do before going into tertiary education? Possible A: catch cold, feel lonely, enter college, graduate from high school, finish junior high  Why is \\"graduate from high school\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Graduate from high school\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is an educational milestone that typically occurs immediately before entering tertiary education. In many countries, secondary education, which includes high school, is the final stage of compulsory education. After completing high school, students receive their diploma or certificate, signifying that they have fulfilled the requirements of secondary education. Tertiary education, also known as higher education, is the educational level that follows the completion of high school. It includes various forms of study beyond high school, such as college, university, vocational training, and professional courses. Therefore, graduating from high school is a prerequisite for most students before pursuing tertiary education. Comparatively, the other possible answers (catch cold, feel lonely, enter college, finish junior high) are not specifically related to the general progression from secondary to tertiary education: 1. \\"Catch cold\\" and \\"feel lonely\\" are unrelated to educational milestones and can happen to a person at any stage in their life. 2. \\"Enter college\\" refers to an action that typically occurs after graduating from high school and starting tertiary education, not before. 3. \\"Finish junior high\\" is relevant to education, but it represents an earlier stage of schooling than high school graduation.

Movie title: Bowfinger Movie plot: The movie opens with Bobby Bowfinger sitting alone in his office reading a script. As he finishes reading the script, he gets a twinkle in his eye, believing that he's found the perfect movie moment. The next day he gathers his staff and actors and tells them about the brilliant script called \\"Chubby Rain\\" that was written by his very own accountant Afrim. They then figure that this is their only shot at making a movie. So Bobby gets out his life savings - some 2200, and they start getting the equipment and the crew that they need to make the movie.Bobby then goes to meet executive agent Jerry Renfro at a chic Hollywood restaurant. He slips the maitre d' 20 and asks to be seated at the table next to Renfro. As he pretends to be an elite movie producer and fakes his way into having a conversation with Renfro about the script for Chubby Rain. He hands the script to Renfro and he reads through it, eventually agreeing with Bobby about the script's final moment which has the hero screaming \\"Gotcha suckers!!\\" that that is a great catch phrase. Bobby tells Jerry about the plans to get Kit Ramsey in the film's lead role. He then agrees that if Bobby gets Kit Ramsey, they've got a go picture.In Kit's mansion, he is unloading at his agent, telling him about how there's no good Hollywood moments and no good catchphrases anymore, that it's all style and no substance. The agent tries to tell him that the script he's just read is good and this movie has that moment, but it's not the moment that Kit is looking for. Kit then heads to his weekly appointment at Mindhead, a psychological collective that has obtained cult-like status among the Hollywood elite. Bobby has managed to sneak past the gate and heads to talk to Kit, now pretending to be a script delivery guy for a major Hollywood agent. He and Kit are having what appears to be a civilized conversation, and Bobby tells about how he's about to go for his appointment at Mindhead.

I mean, I am his brother,\\" is not explicitly mentioned. However, Bobby Bowfinger, played by Steve Martin, has great faith in his accountant Afrim's talent as a screenwriter, despite the fact that they are not related in any way. He is convinced that Afrim's script \\"Chubby Rain\\" could be a huge success and is willing to invest his life savings into making the film. Bowfinger aims to cast the famous actor Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy, in the lead role, but faces challenges in convincing him to join the project. Regarding your decision to invest in this film proposal, you should consider the following factors: 1. The script's quality and potential to be a hit: Bobby Bowfinger is convinced that the script for \\"Chubby Rain\\" is outstanding and has the potential to be very successful. However, you need to carefully read the script and assess its quality and plot coherence to make an informed decision. 2. The cast and crew's talent and experience: In the film, Bowfinger's team is inexperienced and has limited resources. Make sure to research the actors and crew members involved in the proposal to evaluate their skills and past work. If they have a good track record and possess great potential, your investment could yield positive returns. 3. The target audience and marketability: \\"Bowfinger\\" is a comedy that satirizes the Hollywood film production process. Before investing, consider whether this genre and theme will be appealing to a wide enough audience and generate sufficient interest in the target demographic. 4. Production budget and realistic expectations: Bowfinger starts the production of \\"Chubby Rain\\" with a budget of just 2,200, which is significantly lower than the budgets of most successful Hollywood movies. Analyze the budget proposal and make sure it includes a reasonable allocation for all the necessary expenses, including those related to talent, marketing, and distribution. 5. The involvement of a prominent actor: Securing Kit Ramsey's participation in \\"Chubby Rain\\" is a pivotal factor in the film's success within the plot of \\"Bowfinger.\\" In reality, having a famous actor attached to a project can significantly increase its chances of success, but you will still need a strong overall package, including a well-written script, capable director, and efficient production team. In conclusion, to decide your investment in the film proposal, carefully weigh the various factors, including the script's quality, the talents and experience of the cast and crew, the target audience and marketability of the film, the proposed production budget, and any involvement of prominent actors. Research and evaluate each aspect thoroughly before making your final decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Where can I use a credit card without the CVV numbers?","output":"To determine if these two questions are the same, let's analyze them step-by-step: 1. Identify the main focus of each question.    - The first question's focus is on finding a money sender that allows using a debit card without a CVV number.    - The second question's focus is on finding places where a credit card can be used without providing the CVV number. 2. Compare the key components of each question.    - Both questions involve using a card without the CVV number.    - However, the first question specifically asks about debit cards and money senders, while the second question focuses on credit cards and doesn't specify the type of place. 3. Analyze the similarity of the subjects.    - Although debit and credit cards have similarities, they are distinct types of cards with different uses and limitations.    - The questions have slightly different goals: one aims to find a money sender that accepts debit cards without CVV, and the other aims to find places where credit cards can be used without CVV. Conclusion: While these two questions have similarities, they are not the same. They address different types of cards (debit vs. credit) and have different scopes (money sender vs. any places)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again.

This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers:  This short has a \\"story\\" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here. My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ. The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.

However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes.

Please segment the words:","output":"To segment the words from a string of characters, I will look for common English words that appear in the string and separate them out. However, it's crucial to ensure that the remaining letters after extracting a word also form valid words. Hence, the segmentation needs to proceed in a thoughtful order rather than simply extracting words as they are spotted. Step 1:  -The very first word that can be easily recognized is 'The', a common English word that often starts sentences. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watchismadeofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 2:  -The next easily recognizable word is 'watch', a common English noun. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'ismadeofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 3:  -After 'watch', 'is', a very common English verb can be separated out.  Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'madeofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 4:  -Next, 'made' can be segmented out, another common English word which is part of the verb 'is made'. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'ofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 5:  -I can then take out 'of', a simple English preposition. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 6:  -Next, 'stainless', an English adjective can be segmented out. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 7:  -Then, 'steel', a common English noun can be separated. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steel' + 'withsapphirecrystal'. Step 8:  -Next, 'with', another English preposition can be separated.  Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steel' + 'with' + 'sapphirecrystal'. Step 9:  -Then, 'sapphire' can be segmented out. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steel' + 'with' + 'sapphire' + 'crystal'. Step 10:  -Finally, 'crystal' can be segmented out.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A firm handshake could be a sign of a longer life expectancy  , according to British researchers. Scientists at the Medical Research Council found that elderly people who could still give a firm handshake and walk at a quick pace were likely to outlive their slower peers. They found simple measures of physical capability like shaking hands, walking, getting up from a chair and balancing on one leg were related to the life expectancy, even after accounting for age, sex and body size. The study is the first to provide a comprehensive   view of the existing data from 33 studies. \\"These measures have been used in population-based research for quite a long time,\\" said Rachel Cooper of the Medical Research Council's Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging. \\"They may be useful indicators for subsequent health.\\" Cooper, whose study appears in the British Medical Journal, said more studies are needed to clarify whether the measures would be helpful to doctors as a screening tool. \\"I wouldn't suggest that we roll them out into clinical practice tomorrow, but it is possible that they could be used in the future,\\" she told the media. The researchers examined 33 studies involving tens of thousands of people, most of whom were aged over 60 but living in the community rather than in hospital or care homes. The researchers found that those with the strongest hand grasps tended to live longer than those with weak grips. The death rate over the period of the studies for people with weak handshakes was 67 percent higher than for people with a firm grip. The slowest walkers were nearly three times more likely to die during the study period than swifter walkers. The people who were slowest to get up from a chair had about double the death rate compared to the quick risers. \\"Those people in the general population who have higher physical capability levels are likely to live longer,\\" Cooper said. Question: What does Cooper think about the measures of physical capability?

Cooper believes that more studies are needed to clarify whether these measures would be helpful to doctors as a screening tool. She is open to the possibility that these measures could be used in clinical practice in the future, although she doesn't suggest implementing them immediately.

Choose your answer from: (I). no (II). yes","output":"(II). yes These two sentences convey the same meaning, although they are structured differently. Both sentences emphasize that the ceremony they are referring to was legal in nature rather than spiritual. The key difference between the two is their punctuation and structure, but their overall meaning remains the same. In the first sentence, \\"However, it was a legal ceremony and not a spiritual one,\\" the use of \\"and\\" helps to contrast the two types of ceremonies – legal and spiritual – by presenting them as two separate entities. In the second sentence, \\"However, it was a legal, and not a spiritual ceremony,\\" the use of a comma before \\"and not\\" gives the sentence a slightly different structure. Regardless of the structure, the point being made stays the same – that the event being discussed holds legal significance rather than any spiritual meaning. In summary, both of these sentences effectively communicate the same message, albeit with slight differences in punctuation and structure. The overall meaning, which contrasts a legal ceremony with a spiritual one, is maintained in both sentences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Adam Sobel channels Italian-American roots for new Mina Test Kitchen incarnation, Little Italy Mina Test Kitchen Photo: Kevin McCullough For Middle’terranea, the first incarnation of two-month-old Mina Test Kitchen, Michael Mina found culinary inspiration in his Egyptian heritage, while chef Adam Sobel channeled his Jewish roots. While the temporary pop-up restaurant experiment was very well received, it was expected to be short-lived, and we now have an end-date: Not to fret, just a week later, Saturday, October 31st, the Test Kitchen will launch its new concept: Little Italy. This time, Sobel will focus on his Italian American family ties. The chef, who grew up on Long Island, says that this menu is a tribute to his “Nana’s” rustic Italian immigrant cooking. As a child, Sobel spent a lot of time in his grandmother Louise’s kitchen. “She was the greatest person I’ve ever known. She taught me how to cook everything,” says Sobel. Food-wise, the menu will be reminiscent of the Sunday family suppers Sobel experienced growing up, so expect dishes like handmade tortellini, as well as orrechiette “Lou Lou Style” — just the way his grandmother made, with Italian sausage, broccoli rabe, chili flakes and pecorino. For dessert, look for an assortment of Italian sweets that includes zeppole, cannoli and rainbow cookies. As far as drinks, the menu will feature 20 Italian wines by the glass and bottle. In an absolutely old school move, each table will feature a house wine, available by the honor system. A selection of Italian beers and low-proof cocktails, inspired by Italian classics, will also be served. The pre-fixe format will remain similar to Middle’terranea with dishes served family style. Tickets will be 49/person and will go on-sale starting September 28th. Little Italy is set to run through at least the end of the year.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the official name of the event that launched the careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration?  The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism.  The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82°17′S. As a trailbreaker for later ventures, the Discovery Expedition was a landmark in British Antarctic exploration history.

Next question: the tariff of 1828 was known throughout the south as the tariff of?","output":"The Tariff of 1828, known throughout the South as the \\"Tariff of Abominations,\\" was a highly controversial piece of legislation enacted by the United States government on May 19, 1828. The primary purpose of this tariff was to protect the industries in the Northern United States by placing a heavy tax on imported goods. However, this legislation deeply angered the Southern states, which relied heavily on imported goods and foreign trade. The tariff was particularly disadvantageous to the agrarian South, which lacked the industrial base of the North and was more dependent on imported goods than its northern counterparts. As a result, the high duties imposed on these goods led to increased costs for Southern consumers and impacted the region's ability to engage in foreign trade. The economic impact of the Tariff of Abominations was particularly harsh in South Carolina, where the state's economy was especially reliant on foreign trade. South Carolina's leaders, under the guidance of states' rights advocate John C. Calhoun, went as far as to declare the tariff unconstitutional and to threaten to nullify it within the state's borders. This stance led to a heated political showdown between South Carolina and the federal government, known as the Nullification Crisis. The Nullification Crisis centered around the belief held by some Southerners that states had the right to reject or \\"nullify\\" federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. Calhoun, who was Vice President under President Andrew Jackson at the time, wrote an anonymous document called the South Carolina Exposition and Protest in 1828, which argued against the tariff and proposed the idea of state nullification. The crisis escalated further when South Carolina's legislature passed the Ordinance of Nullification in 1832, which declared the Tariff of Abominations, as well as the subsequent Tariff of 1832, null and void within the state's borders. In response, President Jackson issued a proclamation asserting the federal government's authority, and Congress passed the Force Bill, which gave Jackson the power to use the military to enforce federal laws. Although the situation ultimately deescalated after a compromise tariff was negotiated by Senator Henry Clay in 1833, the Tariff of Abominations and the resulting Nullification Crisis exposed deep-rooted sectional tensions that would continue to shape American politics in the years leading up to the Civil War. In conclusion, the Tariff of 1828, known throughout the South as the \\"Tariff of Abominations,\\" was a highly divisive piece of legislation that pitted the agrarian, import-dependent Southern states against the industrialized North. The resulting Nullification Crisis demonstrated the limitations of states' rights ideology and brought the issue of sectionalism to the forefront of American political discourse. The crisis foreshadowed the growing divide between the North and South that would later culminate in the American Civil War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

One, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), is revealed to routinely bribe guards to ensure he is put on the sick list, which allows him to avoid hard labour.A large contingent of British prisoners under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) arrives, defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March as they march in. Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender, Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), addresses them, informing them of his rules. He insists that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all Burma.The next morning, when Saito orders everyone, including officers, to work, Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast. He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face, but the latter refuses to back down, even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers. Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton (James Donald), a British medical officer prisoner, citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers. Instead, the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat. As the day wears on, one of them collapses from heat stroke, but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work. After Colonel Nicholson is beaten in Saito's quarters, the British officers are sent into a punishment cage and Nicholson into his own box for solitary confinement.When Clipton requests to be allowed to check the officers, Saito agrees on the condition that Clipton persuade Nicholson to change his mind.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, \\"Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. \\"Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery . For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,\\"People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. \\" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time.

And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again.

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The cause for the global temperature to go down during the Eocene period was due to the separation of Australia from Antarctica.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. For something that predicts the future, the software is deceptively simple looking. A map of a city is marked up with small red squares, each indicating a 500-by-500-foot zone where crimes are likely to take place next. A heat-map mode shows even more precisely where cars may be stolen, houses robbed, people mugged. The program is called PredPol, and it calculates its forecasts based on times and locations of previous crimes, combined with sociological information about criminal behavior and patterns. The technology has been beta tested in the Santa Cruz, California police department for the past year, and in an L.A. police precinct for the past six months, with promising results. Predictive-analytics software is the latest piece of policing technology working its way into law-enforcement stations around the country, although it's going up against tight budgets, bureaucracy and a culture still clinging to its analog ways. \\"We had to try something because we were not being offered more cops,\\" said Zach Friend, a crime analyst with the Santa Cruz Police Department. Last year, Friend contacted researchers working on the algorithm -- originally used for predicting earthquake aftershocks -- after reading an article in the LA Times. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage. At the time, his city had experienced a 30% increase in crime and a 20% decrease in police staff. He knew they had to try something. At first the Santa Cruz police department used the software to estimate where home, car and vehicle burglaries might take place, handing printouts of the maps to officers at the start of their shifts. Later it expanded it to bike thefts, battery, assault and prowling. The city has seen a 19% reduction in burglaries over the past year. While these kinds of experiments are promising, most police stations are still a far cry from the futuristic headquarters we see on TV shows like CSI. Real police departments lag behind your typical American teenager when it comes to technology -- some police cars still record video on VHS tapes, and it's not uncommon to fill out a police report on carbon paper. Last month, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced plans to develop a smartphone app that would allow officers to file police reports from the field. But SFPD chief information officer, Susan Giffin, told the Bay Citizen the department doesn't have the budget to buy smartphones on which to run the app. (San Francisco police officers only got e-mail addresses for the first time last year.) Thankfully for crime fighters, it's not all landlines, beepers and fax machines. Cool new crime-fighting technology is still being developed and tested by agencies around the country. There are gadgets such as Taser's small wearable cameras for police and other security professionals. The units can mount on a pair of Oakley sunglasses or a shirt collar, and they have accompanying Android and iOS apps. In Southern Florida, many police departments are using portable fingerprint scanners to ID suspects and bring up any outstanding warrants on the spot. The smartphone-sized devices cost 2,500 apiece. A ShotSpotter system uses microphones positioned around a city to detect gunshots and triangulate their location within 40 to 50 feet. A human at ShotSpotter's headquarters confirms if it's a gunshot and alerts the police. The system starts at 40,000 for every square mile of coverage. Some of the more widely adopted tech is decidedly low-budget. Police can Google suspects and check their Facebook profiles to gather information. Friend says the Santa Cruz department has had more luck posting photos of wanted suspects to the official department Facebook page than through traditional police channels. (The unusually tech-savvy department also has a Twitter account, blog, and YouTube channel.) Now predictive policing software is picking up steam, thanks to a few well-publicized test cases, low overhead and impressive drops in crime rates that, while they can't be directly tied to any one initiative, bode well for the maps. Hotel replaces printed Bibles with Kindles. PredPol is new to the field, but IBM has been testing predictive policing software since 2010, using databases of past crimes and information like timing and weather to identify trends and map out predictions. The company has worked with police departments in Memphis, New York City, and most recently Charleston, South Carolina. A final hurdle for all types of new technology is getting the officers themselves to adopt and use it. \\"Law enforcement agencies historically are conservative in their approach to change. That includes to adopting all kinds of technology, from computers in the cars to even radios,\\" said Friend. A new generation of police who have grown up immersed in technology will likely help ease the transition by communicating to older officers that the new tools only enhance what they already know. Seasoned patrol cops rely on their instincts, developed over years of experience walking the same streets and patrolling familiar neighborhoods. Experts say this new technology can cut down on paperwork and make policing more efficient so the police can focus on what they do best. \\"It doesn't replace what they do,\\" said Friend of PredPol. \\"When they get into those locations, they still need to be good cops.\\" Report: Next Kindle Fire will have camera, sharper display.

After learning that Divine has been named \\"the filthiest person alive\\" by a tabloid paper, jealous rivals Connie and Raymond Marble set out to destroy her career but come undone in the process. The Marbles run an \\"adoption clinic\\", which is actually a black market baby ring. They kidnap young women, have them impregnated by their manservant, Channing, and sell the babies to lesbian couples. (Channing is seen from behind, but apparently masturbates and ejaculates.) The proceeds are used to finance a network of dealers selling heroin in inner-city elementary schools. Raymond also gets money by exposing himself (with large kielbasa sausages tied to his penis) to unsuspecting women in a park and stealing their purses when they flee.

Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals.  Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day? Answer:","output":"Nate, the zoologist studying diurnal animals, likely learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day. Diurnal animals are creatures that are mainly active during the daytime and tend to rest or sleep at night. This is different from nocturnal animals, which are predominantly active during the night and rest or sleep during daylight hours. By studying diurnal animals, Nate would have focused his research on species that are generally awake and active throughout the day, which means he would encounter fewer animals that are sleeping during this time. Consequently, he would learn less about animals that engage in daytime sleep compared to Andy who studied nocturnal animals. On the other hand, Andy's research specifically targeted nocturnal species, which primarily sleep during the day. Through his studies, he would have gained knowledge about how these animals seek shelter and create suitable environments to promote daytime sleep. Additionally, Andy may have investigated the adaptations of nocturnal animals that enable them to effectively avoid predators and conserve energy during their inactive daytime period. Furthermore, Andy's zoological research would likely involve the exploration of various behaviors, lifestyles, and habitats among nocturnal species, providing him with the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of fauna that sleep throughout the day. In contrast, Nate's study of diurnal creatures would likely expose him predominantly to species that do not sleep during daylight hours, making his comparative knowledge of daytime-sleeping animals more limited. In summary, given the differences in activity patterns between diurnal and nocturnal animals, Nate, the zoologist who studied diurnal animals, would have learned less about animals that sleep during the day compared to Andy, who investigated nocturnal creatures. Nate's focus on animals active during daytime would have provided him with significantly fewer opportunities to gain insights into species that rely on daytime sleep for survival and energy conservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The leather stayed smooth and the cowboy design unblemished  . And when he looked inside, the contents brought back memories from 1946, when he apparently dropped the wallet behind the balcony bleachers   in the Baker Middle School gym. Fulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17. It was brought to Fulton's door the following day by Melanie Trindle, the Baker Middle School secretary. Middle School Principal Mindi Vaughan said the brown pine bleachers were connected to the gym balcony's brick wall and had remained in the same place since the school, known as the Helen M. Stack Building, opened in 1936. Fulton, 78, said he probably lost the wallet while cheering for the Baker High basketball team with a group of friends. Fulton said the bicycle ID was needed because he delivered medicine for Rodamar Drug. He was surprised, however, that his bicycle ID wasn't inside. He said he always kept it there. But rather than focus on what was inside the wallet, Fulton said the recovery has led him to reflect on his life -- one that took him to the Korean War and Berlin before the return to Baker City.

Write a text based on \\"china says vatican position restricts religious freedom\\" Text:","output":"Title: Vatican's Position Raises Concerns Over Religious Freedom in China Introduction: The recent statements by the Vatican regarding its position on religious matters have sparked controversy, as China claims that these statements threaten and restrict religious freedom within its borders. This article aims to shed light on the ongoing debate, provide a brief background on Vatican-China relations, and outline the potential repercussions of the Vatican's position on religious freedom in China. Background: The relationship between China and the Vatican has been historically complex and marked by periods of cooperation and tension. In recent years, however, there have been efforts by both sides to establish diplomatic relations and address the challenges related to religious affairs in China. Despite these measures, reports have emerged suggesting that religious freedom remains an issue, and the Vatican's latest position has exacerbated these concerns. Vatican's Position: The Vatican has expressed the importance of upholding and respecting religious beliefs, calling for greater understanding and dialogue between different faith communities. While this may seem like a positive move towards fostering harmony, Chinese officials argue that the Vatican's position restricts religious freedom in their country. China's Reaction: According to Chinese authorities, the Vatican's position interferes with domestic matters, undermining the nation's sovereignty by attempting to influence and control its religious landscape. This, they claim, goes against the principle of non-interference in another country's affairs and limits the scope of religious freedom that Chinese citizens should enjoy. Impact on Religious Freedom: If the concerns raised by China are valid, the Vatican's position on religious matters could potentially lead to tensions between different faith communities, fostered by perceived external interference. This could have far-reaching consequences for religious freedom in China, where harmony and coexistence among different faiths is essential for maintaining social stability. Conclusion: As the debate between China and the Vatican continues, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach that respects the rights and freedoms of all faiths while also acknowledging the need for diplomatic relations. Maintaining religious freedom is a matter of global importance, and any attempt to limit it could have significant repercussions. As such, it is essential for all parties involved to exhibit restraint and pursue dialogue to safeguard this fundamental human right."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The charity said there were a further six confirmed or probable cases in the town of Isiro. The outbreak, involving the Bundibugyo strain, was first reported last week after one person had died. Last month an outbreak of a more deadly ebola strain in neighbouring Uganda killed 16 people. The DR Congo outbreak occurred in Oriental province, which shares a border with Uganda. Medicins sans Frontieres (MSF) has said that the two outbreaks may not be related. It is not clear when exactly the deaths in Isiro occurred. A medical coordinator for MSF, Anja de Weggheleire, told the BBC the Bundibugyo strain was still dangerous, if less fatal than the one detected in Uganda. \\"It is normally less mortal and less virulent then the one we have seen in other places... But still it stays a very dangerous and mortal disease... we expect normally figures around 25 to 35% mortality,\\" Ms Weggheleire said. The charity says its staff in the affected area in north-east DR Congo are taking measures to locate and isolate anyone who has been in contact with those infected. Experts have said that Isiro's position as a transit point could make an outbreak more challenging to control. The virus, which is transmitted to humans from both monkeys and birds, causes massive internal bleeding and has a very high mortality rate. It is one of the most virulent diseases in the world and is spread by close personal contact. There is no vaccine for the virus and symptoms of infection include a sudden onset of fever, weakness, headache, vomiting and kidney problems.","output":"An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo involving the less fatal Bundibugyo strain has resulted in 10 deaths, with six other confirmed or probable cases in the town of Isiro, while its relation to the recent Ugandan outbreak remains unclear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What did the man's mother teach him?\\" and the answer \\"Being nice has rewards.\\", write a conversation that might have happened. Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establish the characters and setting In order to create a convincing conversation based on the given question and answer, I will first establish the characters involved. Since the question mentions a \\"man\\" and his \\"mother,\\" these two characters will be at the center of the dialogue. In terms of setting, I will choose a cozy living room for this discussion, as it is a place where family members often gather and talk. Step 2: Develop the conversation topic In order to reach the point where the man's mother teaches him that \\"being nice has rewards,\\" I will start the conversation with a topic where the mother can naturally introduce this idea. The topic could be about the man experiencing a challenging day or dealing with difficult people. Step 3: Create the dialogue Now that I have established the characters, setting, and topic, I will write the conversation using natural-sounding dialogue that leads to the mother teaching the son the specified lesson. Here is the conversation: Man: (sighs) I had such a rough day at work today, Mom. My coworker was being difficult, and I just couldn't seem to get through to him. Mother: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, dear. What exactly happened? Man: Well, he kept dismissing my ideas in front of everyone, and it was really frustrating. I tried to be patient and understanding, but there were moments when I just wanted to snap at him. Mother: (nods) It can be tough dealing with people like that. But you know, your father and I always taught you to be kind and patient, even in difficult situations. Man: I know, and I tried my best to stay calm and polite. But sometimes it feels like being nice doesn't get me anywhere. Mother: I understand that feeling. However, remember what I used to tell you: being nice has its rewards. You may not see the immediate results, but in the long run, people will appreciate your kindness and it will reflect well on your character. Step 4: Conclude the conversation Having reached the point where the mother shares the lesson, I will now conclude the conversation with the man showing his understanding and appreciation for his mother's wisdom. Man: You're right, Mom. It's important to stay kind, even when it's not easy. I always appreciate your guidance and advice. Thanks for reminding me about the rewards of being nice.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

Select from the following. [-] use a melon baller or a dull knife or paring knife. [-] use a basketballer or a dull knife or paring knife.","output":"To remove the apple core for a pi day pie, the most sound option, in terms of naive physics reasoning, is to use a melon baller or a dull knife or paring knife. Below is a detailed explanation on why this option is more suitable compared to using a basketballer or a dull knife or paring knife. 1. Melon baller: A melon baller is a kitchen tool with a small, rounded scoop designed to carve a spherical shape from the flesh of fruits like melons. It is an ideal tool for removing the apple core as its small size and rounded edge can help in scooping the core and seeds out of the apple without causing too much damage to the surrounding flesh. A melon baller provides good control, and with its sharp edge, it can easily remove the apple core. 2. Dull knife: Although sharp knives are usually preferred for slicing and dicing fruits, a dull knife can be used to remove the apple core as well. With a steadier hand and a certain level of precision, a dull knife can scoop out the core without creating a significant mess. The flat blade of the knife allows for better control while digging into the apple and carving around the core. However, using a dull knife can be slightly more challenging than using a melon baller or paring knife. 3. Paring knife: A paring knife is another suitable tool for removing the core from an apple. It is a small, sharp knife that is perfect for intricate tasks like peeling, seeding, and slicing fruits. The paring knife's pointed tip can be inserted into the top or bottom of the apple core, and with a gentle, twisting motion, the core can be detached and extracted. The sharpness of the paring knife makes this process more manageable and precise. In contrast, the other option – using a basketballer – is unsuitable for the following reasons: 1. Basketballer: The term \\"basketballer\\" refers to someone who plays basketball professionally or for recreation. However, it does not apply to the process of removing an apple core. Attempting to use a basketballer would not be effective in the context of removing the core, and it lacks the required properties to serve as a useful tool in this context. From a naive physics reasoning standpoint, using a basketballer would not yield the desired results in the apple coring process. In conclusion, the more sound solution for removing the apple core for a pi day pie is to use a melon baller, a dull knife, or a paring knife. These tools provide precision, control, and effectiveness in removing the apple core without causing excessive damage to the surrounding fruit flesh. Using a basketballer for this purpose is not a viable option and doesn't relate to the task at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This can be done by following several steps, including active listening, sharing personal experiences, being open-minded, maintaining a sense of humor, and exhibiting emotional intelligence.  1. Engage in conversation: Now that you have found some common ground, put it to use by initiating a conversation. Start by asking questions about the topics you both share an interest in, and be genuinely curious about the other person's thoughts and opinions. This shows that you are engaging and a good listener. 2. Active listening: Pay close attention to what the other person is saying and respond thoughtfully. This means not interrupting, showing empathy, and offering your thoughts or personal experiences when appropriate. Active listening is an essential aspect of effective communication, and it helps to nurture a healthy connection between two people. 3. Share personal experiences: As you become more comfortable talking about the topics you have in common, begin to share your personal experiences related to those interests.

Laughter is a powerful tool for bonding. 6. Exhibit emotional intelligence: As you get to know the other person better, be emotionally intelligent in your interactions. This means recognizing and understanding their emotions as well as managing your own. This will help you navigate the nuances of various social situations while demonstrating empathy and support for their feelings. 7. Foster deeper connections: Once you are comfortable talking with guys and engaging in meaningful conversations, try to deepen your connections with them.

How cute was that cat? MEOW!” Brandi wrote. Brandi made quite the impression herself. Wearing in a white mini dress and black and white strappy high heels, she was asked to pose on the carpet by photographers who recognized the family resemblance. Though Brandi, 26, has stepped out with her more famous younger sis in the past, the older Cyrus sib is clearly making a name for herself. Keep reading to learn 5 things you may not have known about Brandi Cyrus. 1. She’s Actually Miley’s Half Sister Brandi and her brother Trace are Tish Cyrus’ children from her previous marriage to Baxter Neal Helson. When Tish married Billy Ray Cyrus in 1993, she had already given birth to their daughter Miley. They had two more children together, and Billy Ray adopted Brandi and Trace. 2. She’s A Fan of Social Media On her Twitter page, where she has over a half million followers, Brandi describes herself as “songwriter, musician, blogger, designer, competitive equestrian.” She has her own blog on Buzznet, where she writes about music and fashion. 3. She’s a Musician Too Brandi plays guitar and is one half of the pop duo Frank + Derol, who are signed to Interscope records. She has also played for Miley and Billy Ray on previous tours. 4. She Has Acted Alongside Her Sister Brandi once called herself “the forgotten” Cyrus child, though she has shared the spotlight with her younger sister. Brandi appeared as a guitarist, customer and “hoedown throwdown dancer” in Miley’s “Hannah Montana” series. 5. She Has the Same Shoe Size as Miley Brandi paired her sparkly dress with strappy, zebra-printed Christian Louboutin stilettos — borrowed from her little sister. During Brandi’s interview with her famous sib, Miley said she was mad that the cameras were only catching Brandi from the waist up. “You can’t see the shoes that I had you wear,” the pop star said. “And they were limited edition.” Brandi confessed that she had to ditch the shoes, because her feet were hurting, but she and her sister ended their exchange with a kiss and “love you.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Miley Cyrus' older sister, Brandi Cyrus, made an impression at the American Music Awards and is a musician, songwriter, and actress in her own right.

More than 2,000 children disappear every day in the United States. These are some of the high-profile cases from over the last 80 years.      Authorities in Europe and across the world are working to determine the identity of an abducted girl found in Greece.      The girl known as Maria was apparently kidnapped by a Gypsy couple. She was initially believed to be 4 years old but a dental exam now indicates she is 5 or 6.      The FBI and Greek authorities will work to determine that the child isn't that of missing Kansas City toddler Lisa Irwin as well as other missing children. Known as Baby Lisa, the infant was almost a year old when she went missing in early October 2011.      \\"There is no such thing as a tip too small,\\" Lisa's mother, Debbie Bradley, told CNN.      She broke down and cried in an interview with Inside Edition. She said she hopes the little girl found in Greece is her daughter. But she said if she is not that it gives her additional hope that her daughter will be found.            Lisa's third birthday is next month and an age-progression photo of her was released earlier this month on the second anniversary of her disappearance.      While the ages wouldn't seem to match, the possible similar physical appearance between Lisa and Maria means all possibilities must be ruled out. Maria is blonde and blue-eyed while Lisa was fair and blue-eyed at the time of her disappearance.      \\"I am not sure there are enough similarities between the girls,\\" a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Still, the official added, the FBI is working with Greek authorities to determine whether the girl could be Lisa.      Media outlets report that the possibility that Maria is Lisa is one of eight serious leads that authorities in Greece are pursuing.            John Picerno, an attorney for Lisa's parents, Debbie Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, said Monday night that he has had contact with the FBI about the investigation in Greece. He said the FBI is working through the appropriate government channels in Greece as they work to determine the girl's identity.      Picerno said he has not been given a timeline for the investigation in Greece.      \\"Whenever the authorities in Greece investigate and inform us, we will know,\\" he wrote in an email to KCTV5.      While police have focused on the activities of Bradley, the couple has long maintained that they had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance and she was abducted by someone who sought to raise her.

The inquiry by Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, whose daughter Lisa Irwin vanished in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2011, was on Monday reported to be among eight leads being taken seriously by Greek police, who have launched an international search for Maria’s true identity.      Of the other seven, another three are in the United States, while there is one each in Canada, Sweden, France and Poland. On Monday night no one in the US or Europe had come forward publicly to claim the child, who has been taken into care by Smile of the Child, a charity based in Athens.      John Picerno, a lawyer for Mr Irwin and Ms Bradley, said the couple’s interest in the girl’s discovery had been registered, but declined to elaborate further. “We enquire about every child that is found and fits the age profile of Lisa,” Mr Picerno told The Daily Telegraph . “We investigate all leads. I don’t have any further comment at this stage.”      Lisa was said to have vanished from the family’s home in Kansas City in October 2011, at the age of 10 months. Like the girl found in Greece, she had blue eyes. Ms Bradley claimed that an intruder snatched the baby from her cot while she was passed out drunk in the bedroom and while Mr Irwin was working late.      However, the parents have been accused of giving conflicting accounts of what happened.      Smile of the Child has been inundated with calls and emails about Maria since taking her in. “By Sunday evening, we had received more than 8,000 calls and thousands of emails,” said Panagiotis Pardalis, a spokesman for the charity. He said the organisation’s website had received more than 200,000 visits and its Facebook page about half a million.      “We even have calls from Japan and South Africa now,” added Stefanos Alevizos, a psychologist for the charity.      Interpol has 38 girls under the age of six on its database of missing children but said none matched Maria’s description.      Prosecutors on Monday requested an “anthropological analysis” to try to narrow down the countries she could have come from. ||||| The FBI is joining the international authorities searching for the parents of the 4-year-old girl now known as \\"Maria,\\" who was found in a Roma camp. NBC's Michelle Kosinski reports.      ATHENS -- An American couple whose baby daughter vanished from their Kansas City home two years ago has contacted authorities in Greece who are trying to solve the mystery surrounding a blond girl found in a Roma camp.      Reuters Lisa Irwin vanished from her home in Kansas City, Mo., in Oct. 2011.      Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, whose 10-month-old daughter Lisa Irwin disappeared in October 2011, got in touch with the The Smile of a Child charity that is heading up the hunt for the girl's biological parents, a spokesman confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday.      John Picerno, a lawyer for the family, said he had contacted the FBI and the couple’s interest in the girl’s discovery had been registered.      \\"The (FBI) agent has made an official inquiry through governmental channels with the authorities in Greece,\\" he said. \\"We are awaiting a response from them, which we anticipate will be forthcoming as soon as possible.\\"      Lisa Irwin has not been seen since October 4, 2011, when her father came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and the crib empty.      The chances of the girl -- who is known as Maria -- being Lisa Irwin appeared to be slim because a dental examination suggested Maria is between five and six years old.      “We enquire about every child that is found and fits the age profile of Lisa,” Picerno told Britain's Telegraph newspaper. “We investigate all leads.”      A spokesman for The Smile of a Child charity told NBC News that of the 10,000 calls and emails they received around eight or 10 were being more closely looked into, including cases in the U.S., Sweden, Poland and France.      Police raiding a Roma – or Gypsy – camp in central Greece found a young fair-skinned, blonde girl who was living with a couple later proven not to be her parents. NBC's Michelle Kosinski reports.      Kostas Giannopoulos, the charity's president, said that although Maria remained in a Greek hospital, she was in \\"good condition\\" and making progress.      “She is happy and playing” he said. “She has learned Greek words better than expected so we are very positive.”      Previously, Maria had only spoken a few words in the Roma dialect as well as Greek, although police think she may be of northern or eastern European origin, possibly from Scandinavia or Bulgaria.      Giannopoulos added that she had been a little picky about her food and a little stubborn.      “When communicating she mostly communicates about the present and not the past,\\" he added.      Maria was spotted peeking out from under a blanket last Wednesday as police swept the Roma settlement for suspected drug trafficking near Farsala, a small town around 170 miles north of Athens. Roma also have been called Gypsies, though that term is considered derogatory.      Greek Police via Reuters Eleftheria Dimolpoulou, left, and Christos Salis, right, are seen with Maria. Officers told Reuters the couple gave at least five conflicting accounts of how the child ended up with them, including that she was found outside a supermarket.      Confused that her coloring did not match that of Christos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who were claiming to be her parents, police ran DNA tests and discovered they were not biologically related.      Officers told Reuters the couple gave at least five conflicting accounts of how the child ended up with them, including that she was found outside a supermarket.      The woman had two different identification documents and other papers suggested the couple had up to 14 children, but six were registered as having been born within less than 10 months. They received 2,790 euros (3,800) a month in child benefits, a police source told Reuters.      The couple faced magistrates on Monday to respond to charges of abduction and procuring false documents but were ordered to be held in custody until they face trial. A date has not been set.      They denied snatching Maria and said her mother handed the girl to them shortly after giving birth, one of their lawyers Constantinos Katsavos, told reporters outside the court.      She's being called the \\"blonde angel,\\" and it was a four-year-old girl's blonde hair and pale skin that led to her rescue. The search is now on for her parents. NBC's Duncan Golestani reports.      \\"It was an adoption that was not exactly legal but took place with the mother's consent,\\" he said, adding that is what the couple testified.      Police have sent Interpol a file with all the evidence they have on the girl, including DNA samples, to seek a possible match with records of missing children.      The possibility of a smuggling ring - in which pregnant women were brought into Greece from Bulgaria and their children put up for sale - was also being investigated, according to Greek state-owned news agency Amna.      Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, police on Monday removed a blue eyed, blonde haired seven-year-old girl from a Roma family.      Officials had gotten a tip-off that a young girl was living with the large family but looked nothing like her brothers and sisters, Ireland's Sunday World reported on Tuesday. The child has been taken into care while the investigation is ongoing, the paper reported.      NBC News' Katerina Voussoura and Reuters contributed to this report.

Police say about 500 tips have been mistaken sightings, and several have stemmed from online rumors. There have been no arrests.      KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Almost two years have passed since a 10-month-old baby was reported missing from her Kansas City home and the case is growing cold.      Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin have said they believe someone kidnapped their daughter, Lisa Irwin, from her crib. Jeremy Irwin said that when he returned home from a late shift on Oct. 4, 2011, the front door was open and the baby was missing.      Police and the FBI conducted extensive searches, even sifting through a Kansas landfill. No one has been charged. There is a 100,000 reward offered to anyone with information that will bring the child home.      The family and their supporters will hold a prayer vigil Saturday night at their home, the Kansas City Star reported. In an effort to show what Lisa would look like today, an age-progression photo of her from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has been released.      “I cannot force the people who know where Lisa is and who might have her into telling us. I have no control over that,” Bradley said. “You do what you can for your baby, because it is your job as a parent to protect your child, and I wasn’t able to protect her from the bad guys.”      Police and a private detective are still investigating, but Kansas City Police Capt. Tye Grant said the tips and leads have slowed considerably, down to about one a week. During the first year, detectives worked more than 1,600 leads and countless baby sightings.      Bradley and Irwin have repeatedly said they did not harm Lisa and had nothing to do with her disappearance. Bradley said she and Irwin think someone took Lisa and is raising the child as his or her own.      “When she comes home and (with) all of the hateful things that certain people have said, they have to answer to their maker for judgment,” she said. “I will have my daughter back, and I will be vindicated, and those people that spent all of that time judging me will be miserable, but we won’t.      “We will be happy again.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In the United States, over 2,000 children disappear every day, and missing Kansas City toddler Lisa Irwin's case is one of the high-profile cases from over the past 80 years.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the topic that this about: Downriver economic development officials geared up Thursday to deal with the latest blow to area manufacturing workers, the closing of the Frito-Lay plant in Allen Park with its loss of nearly 400 jobs.","output":"Downriver economic development officials have become increasingly concerned with the news of the Frito-Lay plant closure in Allen Park, which will lead to the loss of nearly 400 jobs. This significant event has a substantial impact on the local economy, and it is essential to analyze the situation while devising effective strategies to cope with the expected consequences. The crux of the matter revolves around the local manufacturing sector, which has been experiencing several challenges in recent years, including increased global competition and technological advancements. The primary concern for the Downriver economic development officials is to tackle the immediate issues faced by the 400 workers who will be affected by the Frito-Lay plant closure. Some of the pressing problems include unemployment, financial instability, and lack of alternative employment opportunities in the region. In this regard, the officials must develop a comprehensive plan to provide support to these workers, including provisions such as severance packages, unemployment benefits, job training and placement services, and financial counseling. Another essential aspect to consider is the overall impact of the plant closure on Allen Park and surrounding communities in the Downriver area. The loss of 400 jobs has direct and indirect effects on the local economy, with reduced consumer spending, associated income loss for nearby businesses, and potential negative implications for the housing market due to increased vacancies or foreclosures. To minimize the adverse effects of the closure, economic development officials should look into ways to attract new businesses and promote investment in the area to stimulate job growth and economic recovery. Attracting new businesses and promoting job creation necessitates a thorough analysis of the Downriver region's competitive advantages and weaknesses. Factors such as the availability of skilled workforce, favorable regulations for business development, access to transportation infrastructure, and a competitive tax and incentive structure are essential to consider. By working closely with state and federal authorities to identify synergies and develop appropriate programs, the Downriver economic development officials can bolster the region's ecosystem for growth and development. Investing in workforce training and development programs, and emphasizing the importance of advanced manufacturing and technology-driven industries are crucial factors that can help Downriver transition from its traditional industrial base to a more diversified and resilient economy. The success of these initiatives heavily depends on effective collaboration between economic development officials, industry participants, educational institutions, and workforce development agencies. By targeting high-growth industries and focusing on upskilling the workforce, the Downriver area can improve its competitive positioning and become an attractive hub for businesses looking to invest in the region. Finally, strategic partnerships and collaborations are crucial during these challenging times. By developing strong relationships with neighboring communities, regional business associations, and industry clusters, the Downriver economic development officials can profit from sharing best practices, resources, and expertise. Strengthening advocacy efforts in support of the region's unique needs will also play a critical role in securing attention, funding, and other resources from government bodies and private stakeholders. In conclusion, the announcement of the Frito-Lay plant closure in Allen Park presents a complex challenge with far-reaching consequences for the Downriver economy. The local economic development officials must respond proactively by implementing a multidimensional strategy that addresses the immediate needs of the displaced workers while also focusing on long-term initiatives aimed at diversifying the regional economy, attracting new businesses, and supporting workforce development efforts. By doing so, the officials can help mitigate the impact of this unfortunate event and pave the path towards a more sustainable, prosperous future for the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Days after  Chicago police Officer Dina Markham  was found dead in  her  bathtub  a break-in took place at  her  Northwest Side home while  her  family attended  her  wake  police records obtained by the Chicago Tribune show. The disclosure of the still-unsolved âcriminal trespassâ to the residence June 2 adds to the mystery surrounding  Markham âs death as well as that of  her  husband  also a veteran Chicago police officer  whose gunshot death in the coupleâs bedroom 20 months earlier was ruled a suicide. The FBI and county authorities were still investigating the shooting of Sgt.  Donald Markham  in the coupleâs bed when  his  widowâs body was discovered in the bathtub at the residence over the Memorial Day weekend. The Cook County medical examinerâs office ruled Dina Markham  47  died May 28 of an accidental drowning after consuming a dangerous mix of alcohol and the powerful anti-anxiety drug alprazolam  commonly sold under the brand name Xanax. Police had been called to the home in the Norwood Park neighborhood about 6 p.m. that evening after two of  Markham âs friends said they discovered her unresponsive in the water-filled bathtub. According to records made public by the medical examiner   Markham  had texted a friend âHelp. Please ... no kiddingâ a little after 4 a.m. that day. Five days after  Markham âs death  a police officer discovered a sliding door open at the back of the house in the 5900 block of North Newark Avenue while conducting a âpremise checkâ about 10:30 p.m. June 2  according to the records released through the Freedom of Information Act. Two neighbors told police they didnât notice any activity at the house while the family attended Dina Markhamâs wake  according to the records. In May  shortly before Dina Markham's death  at least two officers involved in the probe were interviewed at the state's attorney's offices about their roles in the investigation into Donald Markhamâs death  the Tribune has reported. Records show that  Dina Markham told police her husband  51   had locked her out of  their  home the night of  his  death in September 2015 after the couple had been out drinking and argued after leaving a bar about 1 a.m. In the 911 recordings released by the medical examinerâs office  a distraught Dina Markham told an emergency dispatcher that her husband was unresponsive and bleeding from his head. She pleaded that an ambulance come to the home. Crime lab tests also showed Donald Markham had gunshot residue on his hand  indicating he'd either fired a gun or was close to a weapon being discharged at the time of his death  according to police records. The records do not indicate whether Dina Markham's hands were ever tested. Jim Bastian   an attorney and close friend of Dina Markham's family   previously told the Tribune that Markham had \\"heard rumors\\" of an investigation but had not been contacted for an interview by any law enforcement agency before her death. One of two friends who discovered her body told police that Dina Markham had called her twice at 3:59 a.m.  but  the friend  didn't answer the phone because  she  was sleeping  the reports show. Six minutes after the calls  Markham sent  the same friend  the text asking for help.","output":"Chicago Officer's Home Break-In Amid Death Investigations"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Salene falls in love with the chosen , Ellie , very unhappy and confused , but he rejects them for Luke .","output":"These two sentences, despite their slight differences in structure, appear to convey the same core idea. However, some changes should be made to the sentences to ensure that they accurately reflect the intended meaning. Here’s a breakdown of the two sentences: 1. \\"Very unhappy and confused, Salene falls in love with the chosen, Luke, but he rejects them for Ellie.\\" This sentence suggests that Salene, who is unhappy and confused, falls in love with the chosen individual named Luke. However, Luke rejects Salene's love in favor of another person, Ellie. 2. \\"Salene falls in love with the chosen, Ellie, very unhappy and confused, but he rejects them for Luke.\\" In this sentence construction, it seems that Salene falls in love with the chosen individual named Ellie. But Ellie, who is very unhappy and confused, rejects Salene's love in favor of another person, Luke. However, the use of pronouns (\\"he\\" and \\"them\\") in the second sentence can create confusion, as they are not consistent with the person they are referring to. In addition, it is unclear whether \\"very unhappy and confused\\" refers to Salene or Ellie in this context. To make these sentences more clear, the pronouns and adjectives should be adjusted as follows: 1. \\"Very unhappy and confused, Salene falls in love with the chosen, Luke, but he rejects her for Ellie.\\" 2. \\"Salene falls in love with the chosen, Ellie, who is very unhappy and confused, but she rejects her for Luke.\\" Now, with these revisions, the two sentences convey different meanings: 1. Salene is unhappy and confused, falls in love with Luke, but Luke rejects her love for Ellie. 2. Salene falls in love with Ellie, who is unhappy and confused, but Ellie rejects her love for Luke. In conclusion, the original two sentences seemed to convey the same core idea because of their similar structure, but after correctly placing the adjectives and pronouns in each sentence, the true meaning shows that the two sentences are not the same. The first sentence describes Salene falling in love with Luke but being rejected in favor of Ellie, while the second sentence describes Salene falling in love with Ellie but being rejected in favor of Luke."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead, the premise conveys the exact opposite sentiment, implying that the individual in question was deeply focused on and absorbed by their own emotions, perhaps even to the neglect of everything else that may have been happening around them. A key phrase in the premise that supports this conclusion is \\"far too carried away,\\" which suggests that the individual's feelings were overwhelming or all-consuming. This indicates that their emotions were so powerful that they became their primary focus, preventing them from paying attention to other aspects of their life or environment. If the premise were replaced with \\"But at that moment, I was far too preoccupied with other matters to worry about my own feelings,\\" then the hypothesis \\"I didn't worry about my own feelings\\" would be congruent with the premise. In that case, the individual would be absorbed by something other than their emotions, leading to a lack of focus on their feelings. However, as the original premise is stated, the hypothesis \\"I didn't worry about my own feelings\\" does not hold up. Instead, it would be more accurate to hypothesize that the individual was intensely focused on their own feelings, perhaps at the expense of noticing or addressing other concerns. This overwhelming preoccupation with their emotions would have made it difficult for them to maintain a balanced perspective or consider the feelings of others around them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the profession of the person who said that the Quran had many variations but now only one? Context: The Quran most likely existed in scattered written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.[page needed] University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \\"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based. Historically, controversy over the Quran's content has rarely become an issue, although debates continue on the subject.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Have you seen a historical film recently? Do you think it was accurate? Some say that there is no such thing as a historical film. In many cases, Hollywood film-makers simply change the facts. Just look at these supposedly \\"historical\\" films. 1. The Patriot The film was released in 2000 and was directed by Ronald Emmerish and starred Mel Gibson. It is set near Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Revolutionary War(1775--1783) and follows the story of Benjamin Martin and his fight for American freedom against the British. The film was criticized for inventing and exaggerating British cruelty. The most criticized scene was one showing the burning of a church containing people of the town, of which there is no historical record. Another historical inaccuracy was the description of American-owned slaves being freed to serve with the American forces. In reality, many slaves ran away from their American owners and fought with the British against the Americans. 2. Brave Heart The film(1995) starred Mel Gibson was directed by Toby Reisz. It is based on the life of Scottish national hero William Wallace and his fight against English rule in Scotland during the 13th century. The film includes an affair between William Wallace and Princess Isabella (based on Isabella of France). The film implies she is a mother-to-be when William Wallace will be killed. However, historically, the real Isabella was a child of nine still living in France at this time, never having met Wallace. The film also caused controversy because of its anti-English nature. Apparently, when the film was shown in Glasgow, there was a loud noise made by happy American audience. 3.

Both sentences convey the same message, but with slight differences in structure and grammar. In both cases, the central focus is on the species' naming, description, and discovery by the same two individuals, Samuel P. Iglésias and Lou Frotté. In the first sentence, \\"The species were named and described in 2013 and were discovered by Samuel P. Iglésias and Lou Frotté in 2015,\\" the plural form \\"species\\" is used; however, it is still referring to a singular species. The term \\"were\\" is utilized to indicate that the naming, description, and discovery occurred at two distinct points in time (2013 and 2015). In this case, the repetition of \\"were\\" emphasizes the significance of both events in the context of the species' history. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"The species was named and described in 2013 and discovered in 2015 by Samuel P.

The term \\"was\\" encompasses the actions of naming and describing the species in 2013, while the discovery is noted separately and attributed to the two individuals in the latter part of the sentence. Despite the differences in wording and sentence structure, both sentences indicate the same timeline of events: the species was named and described in 2013 and later discovered in 2015 by Samuel P.

Question: Question: Who plays the role of John Borden ? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: World Without End Context: In March 1957, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor) and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe), are returning to Earth from the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. Suddenly, their spaceship is somehow accelerated to incredible velocities, and they are knocked unconscious. Their ship crash lands on a snow-covered mountain. When they venture out, they discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are now in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing time-worn gravestones and after their ship's instruments register heightened residual radiation, that a devastating atomic war had broken out in 2188, and that they are at least 200 years past that date. (They later learn that the year is 2508). Jaffe is particularly hard hit, as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died. After surviving an ambush by giant, mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. The \\"mutates\\" (as the astronauts label them) are violent, primitive surface dwellers. They have mutated due to generations of exposure to heightened radioactivity. (However, the background radiation has decreased to tolerable levels, and the men later learn that normal humans are often born to the mutates. These, however, are enslaved.) Seeking shelter from the attacking mutates in a cave, the four men discover the entrance to an underground city, whose residents are the descendants of those who fled there from the atomic war. These people live in a high-tech, sophisticated culture. They are a peaceful group led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. Underground, the men have grown less virile, and there are fewer and fewer children born each generation. In contrast, the women remain physically vital (and ready for romance).

Answer:","output":"Hugh Marlowe plays the role of John Borden in the movie World Without End. Released in 1956, the science fiction film is set in a post-apocalyptic future where a group of astronauts, including Borden, find themselves after a time dilation incident. In the movie, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor), and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe) embark on the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. However, their spaceship unexpectedly accelerates to extreme velocities, causing the crew to lose consciousness. When they wake up, they discover that they have crash-landed on a snow-covered mountain and are now in Earth's future. The crew eventually determines that they are in the year 2508, after a devastating atomic war that happened in 2188. They face various challenges, including ambushes from giant mutant spiders and conflicts with \\"mutates,\\" violent and primitive surface dwellers who have mutated due to generations of exposure to high radioactivity. Seeking refuge in a cave, the astronauts discover the entrance to an underground city inhabited by the descendants of those who fled there during the atomic war. The underground society is characterized by a high-tech, sophisticated culture led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. However, the men of this society have become less virile, with fewer children born each generation, while the women remain physically vital and open to romance. In the film, Hugh Marlowe's character John Borden navigates this strange new world alongside his fellow astronauts as they try to survive and adapt to the society they've found themselves in. Ultimately, the movie explores themes of adaptation, survival, and the strength of human spirit in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.
