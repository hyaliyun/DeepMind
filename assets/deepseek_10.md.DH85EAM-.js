If you are an advertising student, there are probably people at your school whose job it is to advise your portfolio. Talk to your adviser about designing your portfolio, or bring your questions to the career counselor at your school. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? How you build your portfolio depends on what's available to you.","output":"Yes, the statement \\"How you build your portfolio depends on what's available to you.\\" can be considered true based on the given paragraph. To make an advertising portfolio, one must consider the resources available to them, such as an adviser or a career counselor who can help guide and provide valuable inputs. An advertising portfolio is a crucial tool for students and professionals in the industry to showcase their creative work, ideas, and skills. Creating a robust and comprehensive portfolio requires taking into account an individual's unique resources and circumstances. Here's a detailed breakdown of how one can make an advertising portfolio, taking into consideration available resources: 1. Identify your strengths: Determine the key areas where you excel in advertising, such as copywriting, graphic designing, or digital marketing strategy. Focus on showcasing your best work in these areas to demonstrate expertise to potential clients or employers. 2. Collect your best work: Gather examples of the various advertising campaigns and projects you have worked on. Select the most impressive ones that showcase your skills and creative ability. Include a mix of different types of projects, such as print ads, digital campaigns, video commercials, or social media promotions. 3. Organize your work: Arrange your selected projects in a logical and visually appealing manner. You can organize your portfolio chronologically, by project type, or by the specific skills utilized in each project. Choose an organization style that best suits your work and resources available to you. 4. Use available resources: If you don't have access to professional design software, explore free or low-cost tools such as Canva, Adobe Spark, or Google Slides to create your portfolio. Additionally, take advantage of campus resources like advisers, career counselors, and workshops. They can provide guidance, constructive feedback, and support for designing your portfolio if you're a student. 5. Showcase your creative process: Include brief descriptions or case studies to explain the concept, target audience, and goals behind each project you've included in your portfolio. This demonstrates your thought process and strategic thinking to potential employers and clients. 6. Make it digital: In today's digital age, a web-based or digital portfolio is essential. Utilize platforms like Behance, Wix, or WordPress to create an online presence for your work. Ensure that your digital portfolio is easily accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing on different devices and screen sizes. 7. Keep it updated: As you continue to create new work and improve existing projects, make sure to keep your portfolio updated with your latest accomplishments. This highlights your commitment to growth and continuous learning in the advertising field. 8. Network and promote: Share your portfolio with others in the industry, such as potential clients, peers, professors, and mentors. Utilize social media platforms and networking events to make connections and gain feedback on your work. In conclusion, building an advertising portfolio depends on various factors, such as an individual's strengths, experience, available tools, and software, as well as the guidance provided by mentors and advisers. Considering these resources and following these steps can help create an effective and professional advertising portfolio that showcases your unique skills and talents."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

EA support unable to resolve the issue. Thousands of people experiencing same issue, DRM sux !! Aparently the cracked .exe fixes this issue ... DO NOT BUY UNTILL THEY RELEASE A PATCH & REMOVE DRM !! Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is indeed negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of the game, the support, and the company policies. To fully unpack the negativity in this review, we need to understand each issue raised by the reviewer. First, the reviewer reports that the game stopped working one day after purchase and installation. This is a significant operational issue that would frustrate any user. A game's primary function is to provide entertainment, and its inability to perform this function characterizes it as fundamentally flawed in the eyes of the consumer. Next, the reviewer complains about the inability of Electronic Arts (EA) support to resolve the issue. The reviewer's expectations of after-sale services were not met, which adds to the negativity of the review. Customer service is an integral part of the overall customer experience. Unresolved issues can lead to customer disenchantment and negative reviews. The reviewer also states that thousands of people are experiencing the same issue, suggesting a widespread problem. The comment implies that the issue is not with the reviewer's individual game or system but with the game as released by the company. Knowing that others are experiencing the same difficulties validates the reviewer's complaint and compounds the negativity of the review. A critical issue in this review is the mention of DRM (Digital Rights Management). The reviewer believes this to be the cause of the problem. DRM is a class of technologies used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, and copyright holders to control the use of digital content after the sale. Some users find DRM restrictive and detrimental to the gaming experience. In this case, the reviewer not only dislikes the DRM but holds it responsible for the game's malfunctioning, making this a significant negative point in the review. Lastly, the reviewer mentions a sort of workaround to the issue implying the use of an illegal solution (cracked .exe file). This reflects poorly on the company as it implies that some players must resort to unauthorized methods to use the game they legally purchased. The reviewer concludes with a strong negative recommendation: \\"DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY RELEASE A PATCH & REMOVE DRM\\". This statement tells potential buyers to avoid purchasing the product until fundamental changes are made, reinforcing the overall negative sentiment of the review. In summary, this review is undoubtedly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and dissatisfaction towards the game, the company's support team, and policies on DRM. The reviewer's recommendation to other potential buyers to avoid the product further strengthens the negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

USA TODAY      Catcher Steve Clevenger is a journeyman with six years in the majors. (Photo: Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports)      The Seattle Mariners suspended Steve Clevenger without pay for the remainder of the season, moving swiftly Friday to discipline their backup catcher after his set of tweets imploring that protestors in Charlotte should be “locked behind bars like animals.”      Clevenger, 30, who has played in just 22 games this season, issued an apology Thursday night for his tweets referring to protests in North Carolina following the fatal police shooting of an African American. He will not appeal his suspension, according to a person with direct knowledge of the issue. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on condition of anonymity because the matter is ongoing.      Clevenger’s tweets read:      “Black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black officer haha (expletive) cracks me up! Keep kneeling for the anthem!      “BLM (Black Lives Matter) is pathetic again! Obama you are pathetic once again! Everyone should be locked behind bars like animals!”      The Mariners issued a statement Thursday condemning the tweets, with general manager Jerry Dipoto noting the club is “examining all internal options available to us.”      Twitter | @jonhumbert Jon Humbert on Twitter      Clevenger was making a non-guaranteed 517,000 this season; his suspension will cost him around 32,000.      A lifetime .227 hitter in 170 games over six seasons, Clevenger batted .221 with one home run this season. He's best known for being included in trades that sent eventual ace Jake Arrieta from the Baltimore Orioles to the Chicago Cubs, and slugger Mark Trumbo from the Mariners the Orioles this past off-season.      Demonstrators in Charlotte have been protesting the death of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was shot and killed by police. Two officers and nine civilians were injured and 44 people arrested on Wednesday in several hours of violence that broke out following peaceful protests, prompting Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency.      Clevenger's apology Thursday focused on the \\"distraction\\" he caused teammates and was \\"sickened by the idea that anyone would think of me in racist terms.\\"      \\"I grew up on the streets of Baltimore, a city I love to this very day,\\" Clevenger said in a statement first released to Fox Sports. \\"I grew up in a very culturally diverse area of America and I am very proud to come from there. I am also proud that my inner circle of friends has never been defined by race but by the content of their character. Any former teammate or anyone who has met me can attest to this and I pride myself on not being a judgemental person. I just ask that the public not judge me because of an ill worded tweet.      \\"I do believe that supporting our First Amendment rights and supporting local law enforcement are not mutually exclusive. With everything going on in the world I really just want what is best for everyone regardless of who they are. I like many Americans are frustrated by a lot of things in the world and I would like to be a part of the dialogue moving forward to make this a better world for everyone. I once again apologize to anyone who was offended today and I just ask you not judge me off of a social media posting. Thank you and God bless everyone.\\"      Clevenger attended Mt. St. Joseph's High School, a Catholic college preparatory school in Baltimore that also produced All-Star first baseman Mark Teixeira.      Contributing: Bob Nightengale      GALLERY: NOTABLE MLB SUSPENSIONS ||||| Thursday, Mariners backup catcher Steve Clevenger made some inflammatory comments on Twitter (the NSFW screen-grabs are here and here). The team immediately released a statement saying that it strongly disagrees with the \\"language and tone\\" of Clevenger's comments.      Friday, the club took further action:      The #Mariners have announced that catcher Steve Clevenger has been suspended without pay for the remainder of the season. — MarinersPR (@MarinersPR) September 23, 2016      Per Major League Baseball's social media policy, that was implemented in 2012, players are prohibited from putting forth social media content that is \\"derogatory or insensitive to individuals based on race, color, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or religion, including, but not limited to, slurs, jokes, stereotypes or other inappropriate remarks.\\"      Clevenger, 30, is a career .227/.284/.324 hitter and has been below average at throwing out would-be basestealers. He's only appeared in 22 games this season. Given his lackluster career numbers, these comments are probably career-threatening. ||||| The other shoe has dropped in the Steve Clevenger saga: The Seattle Mariners have suspended the injured catcher for the rest of the season because of racially-charged tweets about the Charlotte protests, the Black Lives Matter movement and President Obama.      General manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement:      Scroll to continue with content Ad      “As soon as we became aware of the tweets posted by Steve yesterday we began to examine all of our options in regard to his standing on the team. Today we have informed him that he is suspended for the remainder of the season without pay.”      Clevenger was already on the 60-day disabled list and wasn’t going to play this season anyway. This isn’t about playing time, rather they’re punishing him in his wallet. He’ll now forfeit the remainder of his 516,500 salary for this season. That comes out to about 31,900 for the final 10 games.      The Mariners suspended catcher Steve Clevenger for his tweets about the Charlotte protests. (Getty Images)      The tweets that started all this came Thursday afternoon in response to the protests in Charlotte that had turned violent the night before. Protestors were upset about the death of Keith Lamont Scott, a 43-year-old African-American man, who was shot and killed by police Tuesday. When the protests turned violent, one person was shot (and later died), 16 police officers were injured and multiple police vehicles were damaged.

His statement read:      “First and foremost I would like to apologize to the Seattle Mariners, my teammates, my family and the fans of our great game for the distraction my tweets on my personal twitter page caused when they went public earlier today.

I grew up in a very culturally diverse area of America and I am very proud to come from there. I am also proud that my inner circle of friends has never been defined by race but by the content of their character. Any former teammate or anyone who has met me can attest to this and I pride myself on not being a judgemental person. I just ask that the public not judge me because of an ill worded tweet.      “I do believe that supporting our First Amendment rights and supporting local law enforcement are not mutually exclusive. With everything going on in the world I really just want what is best for everyone regardless of who they are. I like many Americans are frustrated by a lot of things in the world and I would like to be a part of the dialogue moving forward to make this a better world for everyone.      “I once again apologize to anyone who was offended today and I just ask you not judge me off of a social media posting. Thank you and God bless everyone.”      The bigger questions now are about Clevenger’s future. He’s a 30-year-old backup catcher who hasn’t played more than 69 games in any season of his six-year MLB career. He’s a career .227 hitter with four homers. The Mariners have him under team control until 2020. He’s arbitration eligible in 2017.      Will the Mariners cut him loose in the offseason? If so, would another team sign him?

As gently as I could , I pushed her away . Why did the narrator suddenly freeze up ?","output":"The narrator suddenly froze up due to the unexpected and surprising action of the other person, who kissed them on the mouth. This situation likely caught the narrator off guard, causing them to experience emotional and psychological shock, leaving them feeling confused, overwhelmed, and unsure of how to respond in that moment.  There can be multiple factors contributing to the narrator's reaction, and it's essential to consider the different possibilities to understand the full context: 1. Personal boundaries: The kiss might have crossed the narrator's personal boundaries, making them feel uncomfortable and unable to react immediately. The sudden closeness and physical contact may have been unwelcome and unexpected, taking them by surprise. 2. Relationship dynamics: The nature of the relationship between the narrator and the person who kissed them is unclear. If they are just friends or colleagues, such an intimate moment might have seemed inappropriate or confusing to the narrator, causing them to freeze up. 3. Social expectations: The narrator might have been uncertain about how to react to the situation based on social norms and expectations. They may not have wanted to hurt the other person's feelings, even if the kiss was unwanted, leading to indecision that caused them to freeze. 4. Emotional state: The narrator's emotional state at the time of the kiss could have influenced their reaction. If they were already feeling stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, the sudden change in events might have simply been too much to process simultaneously, causing them to freeze. 5. Past experiences: The narrator's personal history could have played a role in their response. If they had experienced any past traumas or negative experiences involving physical touch or intimacy, they might be more prone to freezing up in such situations out of fear, confusion, or discomfort. In conclusion, the narrator's sudden freezing up after being kissed on the mouth can be attributed to a combination of surprise, personal boundaries, relationship dynamics, social expectations, emotional state, and past experiences. Their inability to react immediately showcased a complex interplay of emotions, expectations, and thought processes that might have left them feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to respond appropriately at that moment."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way).

(AP Photo/The Anchorage Daily News, Bill Roth) LOCAL... (Associated Press)      Mitch Seavey and 10 dogs crossed the Nome finish line to cheering crowds at 10:39 p.m. Alaska time Tuesday.      \\"This is for all of the gentlemen of a certain age,\\" he said on a live stream posted to the Iditarod website after completing the race in temperatures just above zero. His race time in the 1,000-mile race was nine days, 7 hours and 39 minutes.      Seavey's victory came after a dueling sprint against Aliy Zirkle, last year's runner-up, along the frozen, wind-whipped Bering Sea coast. Zirkle crossed the finish line 24 minutes after her rival, who greeted her after a while.      \\"You did a good job,\\" Seavey told Zirkle as a camera crew filmed them. \\"You're going to win this thing, probably more than once.\\"      At a news conference after the race Zirkle gave credit to her rival's strategy.      \\"Mitch has this ability to sit on the sidelines and refuel because he knows he needs to refuel, while everyone else is zooming by,\\" she said. \\"It's smart, and that's probably why you won.\\"      Immediately after finishing, both mushers rushed to pet their dogs, with Seavey singling out his main leader, 6-year-old Tanner, posing for photos with the dog and another leader, Taurus, wearing yellow garlands.      Zirkle's dogs wagged their tails as she praised them. \\"My dog team is my heart,\\" she said.      The pair jostled for the lead, with Zirkle never more than a few miles behind, in the final stretch.      \\"I just now stopped looking over my shoulder,\\" Seavey said after winning.      Also trailing by a dozen or so miles was four-time champion Jeff King, who was followed by a cluster of contenders, including Seavey's son, Dallas Seavey. The younger Seavey at age 25 last year became the youngest Iditarod winner ever, beating Zirkle to the finish line by one hour.      Mitch Seavey first won the Iditarod in 2004. Before his Tuesday night win, King had been the oldest Iditarod champion, winning his fourth race at age 50 in 2006.      The oldies were still stellar performers in a race that ended last year with a top field featuring many finishers in their 20s and 30, noted Iditarod race spokeswoman Erin McLarnon.      \\"Last year, we saw a lot of those youngsters in the top 10,\\" McLarnon said. \\"Some of those 45-plussers are taking back the lead this year. They are showing the young 'uns what they can really do out there on that trail.\\"      Zirkle, 43, had hoped to be only the third woman to win the race and the first since Susan Butcher won her fourth Iditarod in 1990. Before this year's race, Zirkle noted the long time that had passed since a woman won.      \\"This is my 13th year, and I've wanted to win every year,\\" she said before the race, which began March 2 with 66 teams at a ceremonial start in Anchorage.      The competitive part of the race began the following day in Willow 50 miles to the north. Since then, the race changed leaders several times. Those at the front of the field included four-time champions Lance Mackey and Martin Buser, who later fell behind.      En route to Nome, the race turned into an aggressively contested run among veterans along an often punishing trail.      Conditions on the Yukon River required dogs to go through deep snow and navigate glare ice. Above-freezing temperatures also led to overflow along the trail, a potentially dangerous situation where water has pushed up through the ice and refrozen, creating a weak top layer of ice that teams and mushers can break through.      For reaching Nome first, Seavey wins 50,400 and a new 2013 Dodge Ram pickup truck. The rest of the 600,000 purse will be split among the next 29 mushers to cross the finish line under the famed burled arch on Front Street, a block from the sea.      ___      Associated Press writer Rachel D'Oro reported from Anchorage. Follow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/rdoro.      ___      Online:      http://iditarod.com ||||| NOME — Mitch Seavey scored one for the AARP-eligible crowd Tuesday night by becoming the oldest champion in Iditarod history.      Seavey, 53, outdueled Aliy Zirkle on the final stretch of the 1,000-mile race.      “This is for all the gentlemen of a certain age who think it ends at 50, ’cause it doesn’t,” Seavey said after crossing under the burled arch with a team of 10 dogs.      The Sterling musher steadily pulled away from Zirkle on the 67-mile run from White Mountain, where just 13 minutes separated the two mushers in the afternoon.      Led by Tanner, a 6-year-old, orange-brown husky who is a kennel favorite, Seavey coasted down Nome’s Front Street at 10:39 p.m.      “I gotta go congratulate my lead dog Tanner,” Seavey said after his team came to a stop. “He’s probably the best I’ve ever had.      “Tanner is happy to be a sled dog and he makes it look easy.”      Seavey’s winning margin of 23 minutes, 39 seconds made it the fourth-closest race in Iditarod history. Seavey finished in 9 days, 7 hours, 39 minutes, 56 seconds. Zirkle finished in 9 days, 8 hours, 3 minutes, 35 seconds.      “I was going for it,” Zirkle said, “but that slippery little sucker, I couldn’t catch him.”      As she traveled from White Mountain to Nome, Zirkle watched Seavey’s winding tracks in the snow. She tried to guess if the musher was speeding up or slowing down based on whether the tracks stayed smack in the middle of the trail or drifted to the side.      “And you don’t know,” she said. “But it’s kind of fun to guess.”      “And then for about 30 miles of the trail we’re high above treeline in these rolling mountains, and every time I would come up over the hill I would see him coming back down the other side,” Zirkle said.      Zirkle, 43, said she thought she saw Seavey’s yellow sled after Safety, but it was just a hallucination.      Meantime, Seavey was imagining he was seeing Zirkle all across the tundra.      “I saw the raven Aliy, I saw the fuel tank Aliy. And the upside-down boat Aliy,” Seavey said. “Everything I was seeing back there I thought must be her … I would continue to scare myself that she was catching up to me.”      Zirkle’s time is the second fastest by a woman. Her time last year — 9 days, 5 hours, 29 minutes, 10 seconds — is the fastest.      “You’re gonna win this thing,” Seavey told the Two Rivers musher as he shook her hand.      OLDEST WINNER      Seavey replaced Jeff King as the Iditarod’s oldest champion. King, who was poised early Wednesday morning to claim third place, was 50 when he won his fourth victory in 2006.      Mitch’s son Dallas was 25 when he won last year’s race, giving the Seaveys the oldest and youngest champs in race history.      Both of those distinctions came at Zirkle’s expense. Dallas beat her by 59 minutes, 44 seconds last year.      Tuesday’s victory was the second for Mitch — he won his first in 2004 — and marked his 19th finish in 20 attempts.      “I hate to go off into the sunset knowing I only did it once in 20 tries,” he said, “so it’s sorta a validation.”      The finish was the 12th for Zirkle, who was hoping to drive her team to its second thousand-mile championship of the year. Nine of the 10 dogs she finished with — Quito, Olivia, Scruggs, Scout, Beemer, Nacho, Chica, Biscuit and Willie — helped Zirkle’s husband, Allen Moore, win the Yukon Quest last month in Fairbanks.      “My dog team is my heart,” Zirkle said. “They’re my family and they’re fantastic.”      Seavey will collect 50,400 and a new pickup truck for his victory. Zirkle gets 47,100 for second place.      PATIENCE PAYS OFF      Seavey had to ward off both King and Zirkle in the last one-third of the race.      Patience paid off for him on Monday, when he resisted the urge to follow when King blew through Koyuk to temporarily claim the lead. Seavey stayed at the checkpoint for another three hours and was able to overtake King on the run to Elim.      He owned a 48-minute lead leaving Elim on Monday night, but Zirkle came on strong during the overnight run to White Mountain and sliced 35 minutes off his lead.      Seavey did himself no favors on that run — he twice fell asleep and fell off his sled, according a Facebook post by his son Danny Seavey.      'RUN MY TUSH OFF'      Normally the 67 miles from White Mountain to Nome is a formality. If you get to White Mountain with a comfortable lead, your only job is to avoid screw-ups during the roughly 10-hour trek to the finish.      Zirkle’s plan?      “Run my tush off,” she said early Tuesday as the leaders rested in White Mountain.      Zirkle was trying to become the third woman to win the race and the first since Susan Butcher’s final championship in 1990.      Her sled dogs are a small, pixie-like team that descended from a favorite leader named Cha-Cha, are led by pink-nosed veteran Quito. (That’s short for Poquita, smallest of her litter of Spanish-named puppies.)      Though Zirkle trailed by a scant 13 minutes at White Mountain, King noted that even a lead of a few minutes there can hand the frontrunner the advantage over the final run west across rolling hills to the coast.      “You can get out of sight and the second team doesn’t have the advantage of drafting off you visually,” said King, who said he led DeeDee Jonrowe by about seven minutes out of White Mountain en route to his 1993 title, which he won by more than 30 minutes.      Nome musher Aaron Burmeister like how Zirkle’s team looked in White Mountain.      “Aliy’s team’s coming together really nicely for her. And they’re really coming on strong here late in the race,” he said. “Mitch has been racing up with me at the front of the pack for a good portion of the race, back and forth. I know his team is pretty tuckered, about like mine right now. His are tuckered because they’ve been raced hard.”      But Jonrowe and King said they watched Seavey’s team along the trail and saw formidable dogs.      “I saw (the team) going into Grayling, on the Yukon a lot. Just powered through that wet, nasty, sludgy stuff,” Jonrowe said.      EARLY CONTENDERS FADE      While former champion Martin Buser of Big Lake led at many of the early checkpoints thanks to an unheard of 20-hour run to start the race, it was after his team came off the Yukon River that Seavey staked his move.      By Elim, what had looked like a Seavey-King duel became a Seavey-Zirkle duel. Zirkle rested her dogs for about an hour less than Seavey, cutting Seavey’s lead to 48 minutes.      Zirkle got even closer on the run to White Mountain. Her headlamp alerted Seavey that she was closing in.      “I knew she was coming. I saw her light after I left Elim, when we got to the mountains,” Seavey said. “Typically my team does well in the mountains and I didn’t see her anymore until we got here on Golovin Bay.”      The clang of church bells announced Seavey’s arrival to White Mountain at 5:11 a.m. Tuesday. The musher was still unpacking at      5:24 a.m. when Zirkle slid to a stop, bouncing on her sled.      “Mitch is up for a race, aren’t ya?” Zirkle said to reporters — and a nearby Seavey — as she finished feeding her dogs.      “You calling me out?” Seavey said, heating water a few yards away. He was going to get his sneakers out for the finish, he joked.      “Can I borrow your sneakers? My boots are still wet and nasty from the rain,” Zirkle replied.      OUT OF WHITE MOUNTAIN      Hours later, snowmachines zoomed to the frozen Fish River as volunteers counted down to Seavey’s departure for Nome. Already, 11 teams were parked a few hundred yards from ski planes roaring for takeoff. Dallas and Mitch Seavey hunkered at the elder Seavey’s team.      “I don’t think I’m going to be catching up with you guys by any stretch of imagination. But I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long,” Dallas said of his ETA in Nome.      Under clear skies, Mitch resumed his race.      “Tanner! Gee! Line up!” he commanded his team of 10 dogs before driving off at 1:11 p.m.      Zirkle made last-minute inspections before following 13 minutes later. She walked down her line of dogs, rubbing their faces and checking collars. Once Zirkle was on the sled runners, she called to Quito, who began a whistling howl.      The musher and the rest of the team joined the chorus, then gave chase.      SAFE LEAD BY SAFETY      Late Tuesday, the pair was crossing the Bering Sea shore where coastal wind rakes the snow and Seavey and Tanner could be seen marching west toward Nome.      Quiot and Zirkle, kicking from the sled, followed about two miles down the trail.      By the time Seavey reached Safety, 49 miles from White Mountain and 18 miles from Nome according to the race’s GPS tracker, his lead had stretched to 25 minutes.      A race that looked too close to call just a few hours earlier belonged to him.      Kyle Hopkins reported from Nome and Beth Bragg from Anchorage.      Mitch Seavey and Aily Zirkle at Iditarod Finish Line ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In 2013, Mitch Seavey, at the age of 53, became the oldest person to win the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a challenging endurance test in Alaska. This marked Seavey's second victory in the event, having first won in 2004. His winning time for the 1,000-mile race was nine days, 7 hours, and 39 minutes. Seavey's final race against Aliy Zirkle was intense. Zirkle had been last year's runner-up and, in this race, finished second to Seavey by a margin of 24 minutes. After the race, Seavey praised Zirkle's performance and predicted future victories for her.  Seavey's win also symbolizes a victory for older competitors in the field. Erin McLarnon, an Iditarod race spokeswoman, noted a significant performance from the older participants in this year's event after younger competitors dominated the previous year's race. This win made Seavey and his son, Dallas Seavey, the oldest and the youngest champions in the history of the race. Dallas won the Iditarod at the age of 25 the previous year. Mitch Seavey's victory garnered him a prize of 50,400 and a new 2013 Dodge Ram pickup truck."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How to teach a dog to crawl  Get some treats ready.  A major part of training your dog is rewarding good behavior with a treat. This sends a positive message to your dog that a certain behavior was the right thing to do and that he should want to do it again in the future.","output":"Step 1: Choose a quiet location with minimal distractions. In order for your dog to focus on learning the \\"crawl\\" command, you would want to choose a quiet, comfortable spot without any distractions, such as other animals or people walking by. This will ensure that both you and your dog can focus on the task at hand. Step 2: Get your dog in a \\"down\\" position. Start by getting your dog into a \\"down\\" position. To do this, give the \\"down\\" command and reward your dog with a treat when they lie down. If your dog doesn't know the \\"down\\" command yet, you can gently pat the ground while holding a treat close to the floor to encourage your dog to lie down. Reward with a treat once they're in the correct position. Step 3: Introduce the \\"crawl\\" command. Hold a treat in your hand close to your dog's nose, but not close enough for him to reach it easily. Give the command \\"crawl\\" while slowly moving the treat away from your dog's nose. The goal is to encourage your dog to crawl forward while staying in the \\"down\\" position. Step 4: Reward progress and gradually increase difficulty. Whenever your dog moves forward in the \\"crawl\\" position, reward him with a treat and verbal praise. Repeat the process several times, gradually increasing the distance your dog must crawl to get the treat. Each time your dog makes progress, remember to reward and praise. Step 5: Practice and reinforcement. Practice the \\"crawl\\" command with your dog daily, ensuring you always reward for progress and success. As your dog becomes more comfortable with the command, you can gradually reduce the frequency of treats and only use verbal praise for reinforcement. Step 6: Introduce distractions to strengthen the skill. Once your dog has mastered the \\"crawl\\" command in a quiet setting, you can slowly introduce distractions such as other animals, people, or noisy environments. This will help your dog become a truly dependable crawler, even in challenging situations! Remember to continue reinforcing good behavior with treats and praise during this process. By following these steps, you'll be able to teach your dog to crawl successfully while simultaneously building a strong bond and fostering a positive learning environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who died in 2002? is inside the article: Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies, and have also made use of unorthodox time signatures. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music.  In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy. Gane said that \\"to be unique was more important than to be good.\\" On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that \\"maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [of] esoteric music to understand what we're doing.\\" Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she \\"think[s] we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about Steve Reich or not.\\" The duo were up-front about their..., can you guess it ?

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam (Karnak in the previous films), has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousefâs mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist. The next morning, the...

Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

As a specialist opening batsman, Sutcliffe's rivals on the field were the opposing bowlers and especially fast bowlers, though he encountered many outstanding spin bowlers too on turning or sticky wickets.  By the time Sutcliffe began his Test career, the formidable fast bowling partnership of Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald had ended, though Sutcliffe faced Gregory in Test matches and was opposed to McDonald in \\"Roses matches\\" between Yorkshire and Lancashire. Gregory by 1924-25 was no longer able to \\"frighten batsmen with sheer speed\\" but he still commanded respect and Jack Hobbs specifically told Sutcliffe to exercise caution against Gregory at the start of an innings. Sutcliffe regarded McDonald as \\"one of the best bowlers I ever met\\". He commented on McDonald's trick of \\"resting\\" by making himself seem tired and then \\"hurling himself into (a very fast delivery) like a demon\\". As Sutcliffe said, he never knew which ball would be the fast one and McDonald was a dangerous opponent.  But Sutcliffe was quoted as saying that he had \\"never played finer fast bowling\\" than that of the West Indians Learie Constantine, George Francis, Herman Griffith and Manny Martindale. Among the best English bowlers he faced in county cricket were some of his colleagues in England teams, such as Harold Larwood, Maurice Tate and Tich Freeman.  One of the toughest competitors he faced was the Australian leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett, \\"a tiny gnome of a man\\", who bowled with a roundarm action and made his Test debut at the age of 34, taking 11 wickets in his first match. Grimmett bowled \\"like a miser\\" and \\"begrudged every run\\", whereas his leg spin partner Arthur Mailey was the type of bowler who would \\"buy\\" his wickets by conceding runs and then, having boosted the batsman's confidence, snaring him with a \\"wrong 'un\\" (i.e., a googly). On Sutcliffe's first tour of Australia, he commented that he \\"was troubled most of the time by Arthur Mailey\\" but eventually he learned how to \\"differentiate between Mailey's leg breaks and his wrong 'uns\\". Answer this question \\"Why were they noted opponents of him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"They were noted opponents of Sutcliffe because they were formidable and skillful bowlers, possessing different techniques and strategies that challenged and troubled him during matches.

On the other hand, Sutcliffe faced excellent fast bowling from West Indian players like Learie Constantine, George Francis, Herman Griffith, and Manny Martindale. Additionally, in county cricket, Sutcliffe was challenged by prominent English bowlers such as Harold Larwood, Maurice Tate, and Tich Freeman.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984.

In order to see and discover the true soul of Scotland today and what formed the character of this splendid region, we have to go towards the northern regions, to the Grampian Mountains , beautiful and plain. The Scots conquered the environment with simple spades and strong arms, for it was difficult to farm. The history of this ancient struggle, and its people's ancient love with the hard land, can be felt within the walls of the Angus Folk Museum. You are able to get a feel of the typical rural atmosphere of times past from the everyday artifacts displayed here. From coastal Aberdeen in towards the Grampian Mountains there runs the Castle Trail, a road that touches on many fortresses , which are witnesses of continual fights against the control of neighboring England in Scottish history. Perhaps the most exciting moment for Scottish autonomy is _ experienced inside this ancient church of Arbroath, where, in 1320, the Declaration of Independence was celebrated, at the instigation of King Robert the Bruce. He carried out the plan for autonomy drawn up by the great popular hero William Wallace, for whom cinema has designed the wonderful film Brave Heart, the winner of the five Oscars. This is Glamis Castle, where King Macbeth and Queen Elizabeth used to live. Among the most frequent guests here are the predictable ghosts, if not actually created, by ancient popular beliefs. These have been handed down over the centuries by people tending to live with mystery, with the forces of the supernatural. Another attraction here is a legendary monster: the Loch Ness Monster. Whether it's real or imaginary, this monster, which has been nicknamed Nessie, has collected a good 3,000 sightings over the last 50 years.

This event was a significant moment in Scottish history. King Robert the Bruce, having been inspired by the plan for autonomy drawn up by popular hero William Wallace, instigated the celebration at this ancient church. It marked a definitive step towards Scottish autonomy from the control of neighbouring England, evident in many battles represented by the fortresses along the Castle Trail. Scottish history is deeply imprinted on its landscape, from its coastal cities to the Grampian Mountains, and this event is a powerful testament to its people's determination and love for their land."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: An awful realization is setting in for those trapped in the vicinity of the crippled Fukushima nuclear complex: People are afraid to help them.Residents describe spooky scenes of municipal cars driving down near-empty streets telling people to stay indoors, but they've seen few other signs of outside help.Aid agencies are reluctant to get too close to the plant. Shelters set up in the greater Fukushima area for \\"radiation refugees\\" have little food, in part because nobody wants to deliver to an area that might be contaminated. And with little or no gasoline available, not everyone who wants to leave can get out.Radiation fears mingled with a sickening sense of abandonment Wednesday.\\"People who don't have family nearby, who are old or sick in bed, or couldn't get gasoline, they haven't been able to get away from the radiation,\\" said Emi Shinkawa, who feels doubly vulnerable. Her house was swept away by the tsunami Her daughter, Tomoko Monma, knows she's lucky: At 9 a.m. Wednesday, she piled her family into the car, thankful for her husband's foresight in setting aside enough gasoline for them to make their escape.But she's angry that people living outside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the nuclear plant weren't given help finding public transportation or the gasoline to drive away in their own cars. Monma lives 21 miles from the plant.\\"We've gotten no help. We've gotten no information,\\" said Monma, 28, who sat cradling her thumb-sucking 2-year-old daughter on the tatami mats that had been laid out in a sports center in Yamagata, 100 miles inland, which now serves as a shelter for people fleeing Fukushima.\\"The government is demanding that we don't go out, but it isn't bringing us anything,\\" Katsunobu Sakurai, the mayor of a city close to the exclusion zone, complained in an interview with the national NHK television network . \\"Truck drivers don't want to enter the city. They're afraid of being exposed to radiation…. If the government says we're in a dangerous area, it should take more care of us!\\"The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned American citizens Wednesday that they should move at least 50 miles away from the Fukushima plant, which is leaking significant amounts of radioactivity. That warning is significantly stronger than the Japanese government's warning to keep 12 miles away.Foreign aid workers in the area have been assessing the radiation risks, but many chose to remain just outside the 12-mile zone Thursday morning.Casey Calamusa, a communications officer with Federal Way, Wash.-based World Vision who is coordinating the operation in Tokyo , said a three-member team went to Fukushima on Wednesday to distribute supplies such as water, blankets and diapers at an evacuation center. The team was equipped with protective masks and suits and stayed outside the exclusion zone, he said.\\"They were playing it pretty safe. They were talking to local authorities and letting them know we wanted to help the evacuees,\\" Calamusa said. \\"There is an imperative to help those people — they've had to leave their belongings behind and they're staying in shelters in near-freezing weather.\\"Officials at Westport , Conn.-based Save the Children were still trying to decide Wednesday whether to dispatch staff to Fukushima, weighing information from the Japanese government and their member group, Save the Children Japan, said spokesman Lane Hartill. The group already has staff responding in Tokyo and the northern city of Sendai.\\"This is a first for us. We are a humanitarian organization — we don't know this. We're not nuclear physicists. We want to be able to protect our staff and to help people and their children,\\" Hartill said.The Fukushima No. 1 (Daiichi) plant, which opened in 1971, had been a good neighbor in many ways, providing jobs and subsidizing kindergartens, parks and community centers to gain residents' acceptance. Increasingly, those same neighbors are feeling betrayed.Naoki Nanno, 30, who spent two years as a construction worker on the plant's reactors, complained that Tokyo Electric Power Co. , the plant's operator, had been too slow in disclosing the problems that have mounted over the last few days. When one of the explosions occurred Monday, at the No. 3 reactor, Nanno was on the telephone with his brother.\\"I heard a loud bang and I suspected it was an explosion at the nuclear plant, but they didn't announce it for another 20 minutes are so. There was radioactive material leaking after that explosion — we should have known about it right away,\\" said Nanno, who lives 25 miles from the plant. ||||| Workers wearing protective clothing and respirators head towards the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. -- PHOTO: REUTERS      ONE lone voice has emerged from the group of heroic workers at Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which runs the quake-stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, where workers are scrambling to cool the nuclear plant and avoid a meltdown.      A female worker at Tepco - has written on her blog, speaking up for her 'silent' colleagues who remained behind at the plant.      She had been quoted a little in some overseas English reports but The Straits Times Online tracked and translated her blog to find out her full story when she first posted on popular Japanese social networking site Mixi.      By Thursday however, her post had been taken down, but the entry had already been reproduced by several online blogs and in Japanese language forums.      She is one of the 800 employees evacuated from the plant on Monday, leaving 50 workers behind to battle the nuclear crisis.      On Tuesday, she addressed the growing criticisms levelled at Tepco.      'People have been flaming Tepco,' she said. 'But the staff of Tepco have refused to flee, and continue to work even at the peril of their own lives. Please stop attacking us.'      Tepco, which powers Japan's capital and largest city Tokyo, is one of the main players in the world of Japanese nuclear power, with a history of safety violations.      Even Prime Minister Naoto Kan, frustrated that an explosion featured in the news had not been reported to the Prime Minister's office, is reported to have burst into an executive meeting at the company and demanded what was going on.      However, the plant worker's blog post gives the world a glimpse of the tireless, faceless crew - now dubbed the Fukushima 50 - who are working on the frontline to stop the nuclear crisis from escalating, risking the effects of radiation. In the most severe cases, radiation can lead to higher chances of developing cancer, or even death.      'As a worker at Tepco and a member of the Fukushima No. 2 reactor team, I was dealing with the crisis at the scene until (Monday).'      'In the midst of the tsunami alarm (last Friday), at 3am in the night when we couldn't even see where we going, we carried on working to restore the reactors from where we were, right by the sea, with the realisation that this could be certain death,' she said.      'The machine that cools the reactor is just by the ocean, and it was wrecked by the tsunami. Everyone worked desperately to try and restore it. Fighting fatigue and empty stomachs, we dragged ourselves back to work.      'There are many who haven't gotten in touch with their family members, but are facing the present situation and working hard.'      Battling On      'Please remember that. I want this message to reach even just one more person. Everyone at the power plant is battling on, without running away.      'To all the residents (around the plant) who have been alarmed and worried, I am truly, deeply sorry.      'I know I will be abused and hurt because of this. There are people working to protect all of you, even in exchange for their own lives.      'Watching my co-workers putting their lives on the line without a second thought in this situation, I'm proud to be a member of Tepco, and a member of the team behind Fukushima No. 2 reactor.      'I hope to return to the plant and work on the restoration of the reactor.'      But her pleas seem to have gone unheard. The original post has now been taken down and she has instead posted an apology: 'I am very sorry, but I have locked the post as it was being used in a way I had not intended it to be.      'Having seen what's happening on the ground, my message to all of you remains the same. But others have changed the contents of the post and used it for the wrong reasons, like fanning fear amongst others, and I have therefore decided to lock my post.      'I am praying from the bottom of my heart for the safety of your loved ones. I am sorry it (the blog post) has turned out this way.'

Shelters in Fukushima have little food, as delivery companies are reluctant to enter the region. Traffic in the streets has dramatically decreased and gasoline is scarce. Moreover, information and assistance provided by the government have been deemed insufficient by residents, who are becoming increasingly frustrated. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned U.S. citizens to maintain a 50-mile distance from the plant, a much stricter guideline than the Japanese government's recommended 12 miles.

Once you've confirmed that the item you'd like to map is accessible, follow these steps in the command prompt window to successfully map the folder to a drive letter: 1. In the open command prompt window, type the command \\"subst\\" followed by the drive letter you would like to assign to the folder, along with the full path to the folder. For example: \`\`\`  subst X: C:UsersYourUsernameExampleFolder \`\`\` Replace \\"X:\\" with the desired drive letter and \\"C:UsersYourUsernameExampleFolder\\" with the folder path you wish to map. 2. Press Enter to execute the command. If executed successfully, the folder will now be mapped to the specified drive letter, and you should be able to access it through File Explorer or other applications as if it were a regular drive. 3. To view the list of currently mapped folders or drives, simply enter the \\"subst\\" command without any parameters: \`\`\` subst \`\`\` 4. In case you wish to remove the mapping of a folder to a particular drive letter, you can use the following command: \`\`\` subst X: /D \`\`\` Replace \\"X:\\" with the drive letter that you assigned to the folder earlier.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which period would be more harmful for habitat of species, time A or time B?  Keith was reading a book on climate. He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century. And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century.  Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph and hint, it can be concluded that Time B would be more harmful for the habitat of species as compared to Time A.  Several points support this conclusion. Firstly, Time B represents the earth's climatic conditions in the present century, which has experienced a significant increase in global warming due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal and oil. These actions release gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the rise in the Earth's average temperature by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F) during the past century. This increase in temperature, although seemingly small, can have detrimental effects on the organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments. Secondly, any climate change, whether long-term or temporary, can be hazardous to the habitat of a species. In the given example, a brief change in the climate, such as an increase in sea temperature, may be too stressful for certain types of fish to reproduce. The loss of reproduction capabilities of a species can ultimately lead to a decline in their population and endanger their survival. Lastly, since Time A refers to the climatic conditions in the previous century, it is reasonable to assume that human-induced factors causing global climate change were comparatively lower than they are in the present time (Time B). The ongoing acceleration of fossil fuel consumption and other human activities contributing to climate change make Time B more harmful to the habitats of species, as the rate of change may be too rapid for them to adapt and survive. In summary, due to the increased human contributions to global warming and the greater rate of climate change in the present century, Time B is more harmful to the habitat of species as compared to Time A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions.

It is based on Lee Choong-ho's webtoon \\"Dr. Jekyll Is Mr. Hyde\\" (), which gave a romantic comedy spin on the literary character. The series aired on SBS from January 21 to March 26, 2015 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hyde, Jekyll, Me is based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Hyde, Jekyll, Me is indeed based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character. However, it is important to note that the South Korean television series takes a unique approach in adapting the character by incorporating a romantic comedy spin to the classic storyline. Adapted from the webtoon by Lee Choong-ho titled \\"Dr. Jekyll Is Mr. Hyde\\", the show presents a fresh and modern take on the well-known literary character created by Robert Louis Stevenson in his 1886 novella, \\"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\". The original novella, set in Victorian London, follows the story of Dr. Henry Jekyll, a respected and successful scientist who struggles to control his darker side, which emerges as a separate, evil personality known as Mr. Edward Hyde. Driven by curiosity and a desire to separate his good and evil selves, Dr. Jekyll conducts experiments on himself, leading to disastrous consequences and ultimately, his tragic demise. In contrast, the South Korean television series, \\"Hyde, Jekyll, Me\\", centers around the life of Koo Seo-Jin (played by Hyun Bin), who has dissociative identity disorder as a result of childhood trauma. He possesses two distinct personalities – a cool and stoic Seo-Jin and the warm-hearted, fun-loving Robin. When a cheerful circus artist named Jang Ha-Na (played by Han Ji-min) enters Seo-Jin's life, she becomes entangled in the complicated dynamics between his two personas, ultimately leading to a love triangle. While the series diverges from the dark and gothic themes of Stevenson's classic novella, it still maintains the core concept of a central character grappling with two opposing personalities within the same body. Thus, we can conclude that \\"Hyde, Jekyll, Me\\" is indeed based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character, albeit taking a more lighthearted and romantic approach to the story in the context of a modern South Korean setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Positive Based on the words used in the review, we can surmise that the movie was viewed positively. The words \\"brave\\" and \\"sweetly\\" carry positive emotional connotations, suggesting praise from the reviewer. In this context, \\"brave\\" may imply that the reviewer felt the movie tackled challenging or sensitive issues in a bold and courageous way, not shying away from them but rather confronting them head-on. This could also pertain to the storyline, the character arcs, or the creative decisions made in the movie's creation. It indicates a strength in the movie that the reviewer appreciated. \\"Sweetly,\\" on the other hand, suggests that there was a gentle, tender, or heartfelt aspect to the movie that the reviewer found endearing or touching. It could refer to the emotional tone of the movie, the relationships between characters, or poignant moments in the storyline. Thus, combining these two adjectives gives the impression of a movie that balances an ambitious or daring approach with moments of warmth, compassion, or sensitivity, and that blend has left a positive impression on the reviewer.

Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

This hearty dish is perfect for those who want a simple yet delicious meal that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. The ingredients are readily available, which makes this recipe convenient and perfect for both beginners and seasoned cooks alike. In this article, we will explore the step-by-step process of making these fish and potato patties that you wouldn't want to miss out on. Ingredients: - 4 medium-sized potatoes - 2 cups cooked and flaked fish (can use salmon, cod, or any other white fish) - 2 large eggs - 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley - 1 small onion, finely diced - 1 cup breadcrumbs - Salt and pepper to taste - Butter or oil for frying Instructions: 1. Poaching and peeling the potatoes:     Start by preparing the potatoes. Rinse and scrub them thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt and debris. Then, place the potatoes in a large pot and fill it with enough water to cover all the potatoes completely. Add some salt to the water and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the potatoes cook until they become tender. You can check the tenderness of the potatoes by gently piercing them with a fork or a knife.     Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and let them cool down slightly. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, carefully peel off the skin and discard it. Set the peeled potatoes aside for later use. 2. Preparing the fish:     Flake the cooked fish into small pieces and discard any skin or bones. You can use your preferred type of fish, such as salmon, cod, or any other white fish. If using canned fish, ensure that you drain it properly before flaking. 3. Mixing the ingredients:     In a large mixing bowl, combine the peeled potatoes and flaked fish. Using a fork or a potato masher, mash the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed. Add the eggs, chopped parsley, finely diced onion, and breadcrumbs to the fish and potato mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste, making sure to mix well. The mixture should have a consistency that allows it to hold its shape when formed into patties. 4. Forming the patties:     Divide the mixture into eight equal portions. Using your hands, gently form the portions into rounded, flat patties. Be sure not to overwork or compact the mixture too much; this will ensure that you have light and tender patties. Place the formed patties on a tray or plate and set them aside. 5. Frying the fish and potato patties:     In a large frying pan or skillet, add enough butter or oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Heat the butter or oil over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Carefully place the patties in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd them. You may need to fry the patties in batches depending on the size of your pan.     Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and crispy. Adjust the heat accordingly to ensure that the patties are cooked through without burning the exterior. Once cooked, remove the patties from the pan and let them drain on paper towels to remove any excess oil. Serving Suggestions: These fish and potato patties are delicious when served with a side of tartar sauce, mixed greens, or even a simple cucumber salad. Enjoy them as a main dish, or as a tasty appetizer for your next gathering. No matter how you serve them, these fish and potato patties are sure to be a hit! Conclusion: This fish and potato patties recipe is an easy and delectable option for various occasions. Not only will this dish impress your family and friends, but it will also showcase how versatile and enjoyable fish can be. Take the chance to experiment with different fish types, seasonings, and sides to make this dish uniquely yours. Happy cooking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

We have an equation: 3 * z - 309 + 294 = 0 First, let's add the numbers -309 and 294. It is like having -309 candies and gaining 294 candies, so you would mostly get rid of your debt, but you would still owe: -309 + 294 = -15 So now our equation looks like this: 3 * z - 15 = 0 Next, we want to find out how many candies we need to add to -15 to get 0. In other words, we need to make -15 into 0, which means to add 15: 3 * z - 15 + 15 = 0 + 15 So we have: 3 * z = 15 Now, we need to find out how many times we need to add 3 to get 15. You know, like how many groups of 3 candies we need to have 15 candies in total. We do this by dividing 15 by 3: z = 15 / 3 When we divide 15 by 3, we get: z = 5 And there you have it!

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Imagine that you are the first person ever to see Hawaii. What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average  temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers   in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles   rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes  , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting   for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days.

Answer the following question: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave.  Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day?  Hint: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Answer:","output":"Considering the influence of circadian rhythms on human biology and behaviors, it is more likely that Jason, the average guy who goes to work each day, follows a more regular meal schedule than Brad, who lives in a dark cave with limited exposure to natural light. Circadian rhythms operate on a 24-hour cycle and are significantly influenced by external factors such as light and darkness. The biological clock, located in the hypothalamus of the brain, is responsible for regulating these rhythms by sending signals to the body. These signals cause changes in behaviors and body processes, such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, body temperature, and digestion. In Jason's case, he has a more typical routine, including exposure to natural light when he goes to work, exercises, or goes out. This exposure to light influences his biological clock, creating a more structured and consistent daily routine. As a result, his body is likely to send hunger signals at regular intervals, aligning his meal times with typical societal schedules. On the other hand, Brad lives in a dark cave with almost no exposure to natural light, which can disrupt his circadian rhythms. Without the crucial external cues provided by natural light, his biological clock may become desynchronized, which can lead to irregular eating patterns. Although he may still follow a routine by lighting candles, the absence of natural light ultimately makes it more challenging for him to maintain a consistent meal schedule. Taking these factors into account, Jason would be more likely to eat meals at the same time each day due to the influence of circadian rhythms and his exposure to natural light, which is essential in regulating his biological clock and coordinating daily activities and bodily processes, including digestion and hunger signals. Conversely, Brad's limited exposure to natural light, living in a dark cave, could disrupt his circadian rhythms, making it less likely for him to consistently eat meals at regular intervals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the three given options: living in a city, staying home, or refusing to take walks, the most relevant choice would be Remy living in a city. Here is a detailed answer explaining the context and actions that would lead to Remy finding money in the city: Remy would first need to establish a life for himself in a city. This process would involve him finding a suitable place to call home, such as an apartment or a house, close enough to the heart of the city to make it easily accessible. Before moving in, he would need to make sure that his new home provides all the required amenities such as gas, electricity, and water connections. Additionally, Remy would need to secure a stable source of income so he can afford to pay for his living expenses. This could involve finding a job or running a business, depending on his skills and interests. After securing his financial stability, it would be essential for Remy to familiarize himself with the city's geography to better navigate its streets and make use of the public transportation systems, such as buses, subways, or taxis (if available). Remy would also need to build connections in the city by forming friendships and acquaintances with his neighbors, coworkers, or people he encounters in day-to-day life. These connections would allow him to establish a social circle within the city, which could lead to opportunities for discovering places of interest and expanding his understanding of the local culture and language, especially if Remy moved to a city of a different cultural background or one that has another primary language. Furthermore, Remy must become acquainted with the city's administrative and legal systems, such as understanding the local tax regulations, traffic rules, and public services provided by the local government. This knowledge will help him avoid any potential issues that may arise due to a lack of knowledge or misinformation about the city's regulations and laws. Now that Remy has settled comfortably in the city, he may decide to explore his surroundings and take walks around the different neighborhoods and districts. During one of these walks, Remy would then encounter the scene mentioned in the given context: walking in the city by himself and finding money near a particular sector. Depending on the circumstances, Remy might choose to either keep the found money or perhaps search for the owner and return it, exhibiting his moral values and character. In summary, for Remy to come across money in the city, he needs to live in a city, become familiar with its setup and systems, and take walks to explore the various areas. With this context, finding money in the city would be possible during one of his leisure walks or while running errands in the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whitman, who has already spent 71 million securing the Republican nomination, seems to have Brown worried, with the Democratic candidate drawing comparisons between Whitman and Nazi propaganda master Joseph Goebbels. Brown, who is also California's Attorney General, highlighted Goebbels' role in developing propaganda and controlling public opinion during the Nazi era. \\"Goebbels invented this kind of propaganda. He took control of the whole world,\\" Brown stated this week while jogging in Oakland. The comparison stemmed from Brown's belief that Whitman's campaign is driven by her ambition to become the first female president of the United States. \\"She wants to be president. That's her ambition, the first woman president. That's what this is all about,\\" Brown noted. His comments were first reported by a KCBS radio reporter who happened to encounter Brown while jogging and subsequently shared the story on his blog.

By David Mccormack Singer Heather Naylor of The Electric Barabellas has accused Sydney Holland of wrestling control of Sumner Redstone's life and forcing him to pull support for her MTV series, which was canceled in 2013 Media mogul Sumner Redstone’s complicated professional and private life is being played out in court with his 43-year-old live-in girlfriend involved in a potentially damaging legal battle with the star of an ill-fated MTV reality series that the 91-year-old billionaire had befriended. The nonagenarian’s girlfriend Sydney Holland has been waging her legal battle against Heather Naylor, a singer who starred in the short-lived MTV series The Electric Barbarellas, since August. ‘Holland grew jealous of Naylor's relationship with Redstone and made efforts to cut off all ties between Redstone and OPTIONS: - David Mccormack so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Forbes so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Heather Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Holland so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - MTV so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Redstone so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Singer so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Singer Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Sumner Redstone so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Sydney Holland so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - The Electric Barabellas so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - The Electric Barbarellas so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Viacom so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint.","output":"The correct answer is:  - Heather Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. The whole story pointed out a situation between Heather Naylor and Sydney Holland. Sydney Holland was accused of trying to control Sumner Redstone, and she wanted to cut all ties with Heather Naylor.  Here's why the other answers are wrong: David McCormack, Forbes, MTV, Singer, Singer Naylor, Sumner Redstone, Sydney Holland, The Electric Barabellas, The Electric Barbarellas, and Viacom are not correct because Sydney Holland was not trying to cut all ties with these people or things. She was specifically trying to cut ties with Heather Naylor.  \\"Holland so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage\\" does not make sense because Sydney Holland would not cut ties with herself. \\"Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage\\" is incorrect due to the lack of a first name. The correct choice should include Heather's full name, Heather Naylor. \\"Redstone so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage\\" is wrong because she wasn't trying to stop talking to Redstone- she wanted control over him! So think about it like this: if two kids are playing tag, and one kid wants to make sure they're always 'it' so they can always be in control, they will try to stop the other kid from being able to tag anyone else. That's what Holland was trying to do to Naylor!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

During this phase, the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis. Interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, reads its DNA, and conducts other \`\`normal'' cell functions. The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase. This phase was formerly called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather, the cell is living, and preparing for later cell division, so the name was changed. A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis. However, since mitosis is the division of the nucleus, prophase is actually the first stage. What's the best answer to this question: interphase is a phase of mitosis true or false?","output":"False. Interphase is not a phase of mitosis. It is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life preparing for cell division, but it occurs before mitosis begins. Mitosis consists of the following stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the word \\"feeling\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? I had a strange feeling in my leg. She had a feeling of euphoria.","output":"Though the word \\"feeling\\" is used in both sentences, it takes on slightly different nuances of meaning in each context. Let's analyze each sentence to get a clearer understanding of the subtle distinctions between these two uses. 1. I had a strange feeling in my leg. In this sentence, \\"feeling\\" refers to a physical sensation experienced by the person. It could indicate an unusual muscular pain, numbness, a tingling sensation, or any other unexpected sensory change in the leg. This use of \\"feeling\\" is mainly related to the physiological aspect of the individual and concerns the perception of bodily sensations. It can often point to something being wrong, or at least out of the ordinary, with their physical condition. 2. She had a feeling of euphoria. In this context, \\"feeling\\" is used to describe an emotional or psychological state of an individual. Euphoria is a feeling of extreme happiness, joy, elation, or well-being, and it occurs as an internal reaction to an external event or a particular situation. In this scenario, the term \\"feeling\\" alludes to the person's emotional condition and mental experience and is not directly related to bodily sensations or physical aspects. To summarize, while both sentences use the term \\"feeling\\", the first sentence interprets it as a physical sensation, and the second one associates it with an emotional or psychological state. Both contexts involve perception and awareness, but utilize it on distinct aspects of human experience – physiological versus emotional."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to talk about something very important. Do you know what a refugee is? A refugee is a person who has to leave their home and country because it's not safe for them there. They might be very scared or sad, and they need to find a new place where they can feel safe and happy. Unicef, a big group that helps children all around the world, has some news for us. They say that in the last 10 years, the number of children who are refugees has doubled. That means there are now two times as many kids who had to leave their homes as there were 10 years ago. That's a lot of kids! But why are so many children becoming refugees? There are many reasons. Some kids have to leave their homes because of wars or fights between people in their country. Others might have to go because there are not enough food or water, or they feel scared because of bullies. Unicef wants to help these children who are refugees. They believe that every child should have a chance to be safe, healthy, and happy. They work with other people and groups to give the kids a place to live, food to eat, and help them go to school, so they can learn and play like you do. So now, when you hear the word \\"refugee\\", you'll know that it means a person, like a kid, who had to leave their home to be safe. And it's important that we all try to understand why this happens and think about ways we can help these kids feel better. Maybe you can talk to your family and friends about what you learned today.

It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.  - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach.  - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V.  - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation.  - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented.  - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop .  - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek  , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides.  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.

It was a public relations battle featuring two well-known masters of the media, a beauty queen, and a controversial question: Should someone born a man be allowed to compete in the Miss Universe pageant? On the East Coast was Donald Trump, the New York business tycoon whose fortune and brand is boosted by his ability to navigate storms of controversy. On the West Coast was Gloria Allred, a Beverly Hills lawyer legendary for her ability to draw hordes of cameras to her law office to capture her outrage over alleged injustices done to her clients. The client is Jenna Talackova, a 23-year-old, 6-foot-1-inch blond Canadian, who underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago. Talackova won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for Canada's national title, but she was then told the Miss Canada Universe pageant in Toronto on May 19 was only open to \\"naturally born females.\\" \\"I am a woman,\\" Talackova said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in Allred's conference room Tuesday. \\"I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust.\\" Allred attacked Trump, who owns and controls the Miss Universe franchise, for questioning Talackova's sexuality. \\"She did not ask Mr. Trump to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male,\\" Allred said. How she became a female is not important, she said. \\"The Miss Universe competition is designed to find the one person in the world whose human qualities make them worthy of the Miss Universe crown and title,\\" Allred said. \\"Jenna is beautiful in every way. Her life story will undoubtedly inspire people throughout the world.\\" Talackova, in a 2010 interview, said she knew she was a girl at age 4. She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19. Trump, warned of Allred's attack when the lawyer alerted reporters Monday afternoon that she would hold the news conference, shifted his pageant's position in an announcement Monday night. Talackova could compete provided \\"she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions,\\" the Miss Universe Organization said. Trump's maneuver didn't appear to temper Allred's outrage. \\"The last-minute statement by Mr. Trump's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue,\\" she said. \\"Instead of stating clearly that Jenna will be allowed to compete, Mr. Trump qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous.\\" She asked Trump for \\"a clear answer -- not a wimpy, wishy-washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank.\\" Allred didn't know it then, but Trump gave a clearer statement to CNN in New York two hours earlier. \\"We went by the laws of Canada and the laws of the United States, and those laws say that she should be allowed to enter the pageant,\\" Trump said. \\"So she will be entering the Miss Canada pageant.\\" When read Trump's new statement, Allred paused for several seconds and said \\"I stand by my statement. We want this rule eliminated.\\" \\"We want a clearer statement that this rule will be eliminated,\\" Allred said. \\"Step up, say it loudly, say it clearly, this rule will never be in effect again for anyone.\\" Allred declined to have Talackova react to Trump's decision to let her compete. \\"Sorry,\\" Talackova whispered to a reporter, apologizing for her silence. Allred would not say if her client still intended to compete in the pageant. Controversy over pageant rules is not new for Trump. The media stir over Miss California Carrie Prejean's same-sex marriage comments at Trump's Miss USA pageant three years ago raised the profile of that competition. Prejean, in response to a question from a judge, declared her opposition to same-sex marriage. Trump initially said Prejean could keep her Miss California title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. He eventually fired her for \\"contract violations,\\" including missed public appearances. Allred has affected more than beauty contests. She hosted several news conferences in 2010 to reveal evidence that Meg Whitman, who was then the Republican nominee for governor of California, employed an undocumented worker. The October surprise hampered Whitman's campaign at a crucial time in her race against Jerry Brown, who won the election. CNN's Doug Hyde contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses a public relations battle surrounding the eligibility of Jenna Talackova, a transgender woman, to compete in the Miss Universe pageant. Lawyer Gloria Allred represented Talackova and demanded a clear statement from pageant owner Donald Trump as to whether Talackova would be allowed to compete. Trump stated that Talackova could compete, provided she met the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada and the standards established by other international competitions. Even with the statement, Allred maintained that the rule preventing Talackova from competing should be eliminated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the following context:  Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person who renounces his and his descendants' rights to the French throne?","output":"Based on the given context, the full name of the person who renounced his and his descendants' rights to the French throne is Philippe of Anjou."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  Question: \\"How many casualties resulted in the attack on the U.S Navy Destroyer?\\" Answer: \\"At 17 members were killed and at least 40 members wounded in the attack\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

More than 50 years after the fact, Cuba has published the diary that Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara kept during the armed struggle that he waged alongside Fidel Castro from the Sierra Maestra mountains. \\"Diary of a Combatant\\" recounts Guevara's experiences from coming ashore in Cuba on December 2, 1956, until shortly before the bearded rebels declared victory January 1, 1959. According to Guevara's widow, Aleida March, the goal is \\"to show his work, his thoughts, his life, so that the Cuban people and the entire world get to know him and don't distort things anymore.\\" The book was edited by the Che Guevara Studies Center, which is directed by March, and published by Australia's Ocean Press/Ocean Sur. Researchers said that Guevara kept his diary in hand-written notebooks and that part of the reason they put off publishing the diary was because some of the notebooks were missing. \\"Where are the notebooks? We don¹t know, and there are a lot of different versions,\\" Maria del Carmen Ariet, a leading researcher from the Che Guevara Studies Center, said at a press conference to launch the book.

Some of Guevara's other diaries have been commercially successful, most notably \\"The Motorcycle Diaries,\\" the memoir of a 23-year-old medical student on a road trip in Latin America. Guevara was born in Argentina in 1928 and met Castro in 1955 in Mexico City, where he was plotting his return to Cuba to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. During the guerrilla fighting in the mountains, Guevara was the first subordinate to be promoted to the rank of \\"comandante\\" by Castro.

Hours later, in the middle of the night, Andy arrives at the front door in full uniform and apparently unharmed; the family accepts the notice of his death as a clerical error and welcomes him back with joy. Over the next few days, Andy displays strange and erratic behavior, dressing in an unusually concealing manner and spending his days sitting around the house listless and anemic.

Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months.  and a hint : In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood.

Monitor your blood sugar. Article:","output":"Title: How to Manage Your Health: Monitoring Common Side Effects of Medications Introduction Medications, while being essential for treating various illnesses and conditions, can sometimes have immediate side effects. It is crucial for patients to be aware of these side effects and take the necessary steps to monitor their health accordingly. In this article, we will discuss some of the possible side effects and provide recommendations on how to manage your overall health while being on prescription medication. 1. Know the possible immediate side effects Before starting any new medication, it is essential to discuss and understand the potential side effects with your healthcare provider. This will allow you to be prepared and alert for any changes in your health condition. Common immediate side effects may include dizziness, nausea, headaches, skin rash, or changes in appetite. If you experience any of these symptoms, inform your healthcare provider as soon as possible to evaluate whether adjustments to your medication are necessary. 2. Monitor vitamin and mineral levels Certain medications may have an impact on the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals. This could lead to deficiencies that affect your overall health and well-being. To avoid complications, it is essential to have your vitamin and mineral levels checked regularly. Your healthcare provider can recommend any necessary dietary changes or supplements based on your specific requirements. 3. Get checked periodically for heart disease Some medications can increase the risk of heart disease by raising blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or causing inflammation. It is essential to have regular checkups with your healthcare provider to monitor your heart health and make any necessary adjustments to your medication or lifestyle. Early detection of heart disease can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications in the future. 4. Be on the lookout for weight gain Weight gain is a common side effect of many medications, especially those used for treating mental health conditions or chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Gaining excess weight can lead to a variety of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and joint problems. Be proactive in managing your weight by adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and discussing any concerns with your healthcare provider. 5. Monitor your blood sugar Some medications can cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels, affecting individuals both with and without diabetes. It is crucial to keep track of your blood sugar and report any significant changes to your healthcare provider. Those with diabetes may need to adjust their diabetes management plan to accommodate for the effects of the medication. If you do not have diabetes, be aware of symptoms such as increased thirst, frequent urination, or unexplained fatigue, as these could be signs of high blood sugar. Conclusion Being proactive about monitoring your health while taking prescription medications is essential in preventing and addressing any side effects or complications. Understanding the potential side effects, checking your vitamin and mineral levels, getting regular checkups for heart disease, managing your weight, and monitoring blood sugar levels are crucial steps to ensure your well-being while on medication. Always consult with your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and support throughout your treatment journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out. He is training, new comer Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as very sick, disturbed puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He keeps getting warned for this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. During his final few days on the job, a young girl goes missing, and Babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray. Him and Allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone AWOL. So, he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police. That part is a little far fetched. There is some sick, twisted stuff shown in this film.

Question: \\"What language was replaced in Central Asia?\\"  Context: \\"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages.

In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.\\"  Answer:","output":"The language that was replaced in Central Asia is primarily the group of Iranian languages, which were once spoken across a vast region including parts of Central Asia, Western Iran, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus. This displacement occurred due to several factors such as the spread of Arabic, Turkic languages, and the assimilation by the Proto-Slavic population. The Iranian languages that were displaced or replaced include Sogdian, Bactrian, Scythian, Sarmatian, Alan, and others. In Western Iran, the spread of Arabic into areas like Khuzestan led to the displacement of some Iranian languages as the influence of the Islamic Caliphate grew. This Arabic influence became more pronounced following the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century. In Central Asia, Turkic languages began to spread across the region as various Turkic tribes and confederations expanded their territories. These Turkic languages, such as Khazar, Kipchak, and Oghuz, influenced and eventually replaced Iranian languages like Sogdian and Bactrian in several parts of modern-day Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The displacement of Iranian languages in Eastern Europe can be attributed to the absorption and assimilation by the growing Proto-Slavic population. This occurred across the territories of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, which were once the core regions of the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans. By the 6th century AD, these regions had been substantially Slavicized, leading to the extinction of the once dominant Scythian languages. Today, only a few remnants of the once widespread Iranian languages are still spoken in isolated pockets. Yaghnobi, a close relative of Sogdian, is spoken in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand. Saka, another Scythian language, survives as Ossetic in the Caucasus. Additionally, a number of small Eastern Iranian languages persist in the Pamir Mountains region. In conclusion, the Iranian languages were largely replaced in Central Asia and other regions due to the spreading and influx of new languages like Arabic and Turkic, as well as socio-cultural assimilation by the expanding Proto-Slavic population. The displacement of these languages signifies an important linguistic and cultural transition in the region throughout history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select from the following. [i] yes. [ii] it is not possible to tell. [iii] no.","output":"[ii] it is not possible to tell. To properly address the question of whether the statement \\"It's a terrible idea and I don't want it to work\\" follows from the original assertion, it is necessary to delve into the context and reasoning behind both opinions. The given information does not provide enough insight into the situation or idea being assessed, making it difficult to definitively determine a direct correlation between the two perspectives. The original statement, \\"I think basically it's a good idea you know I hope it works,\\" implies that the speaker believes the idea has potential and wishes for its success. However, this statement alone does not provide any information about the specific idea itself. On the other hand, the contrasting statement \\"It's a terrible idea and I don't want it to work\\" conveys a negative opinion about the idea, suggesting that the speaker thinks it is flawed or detrimental. Again, without any context or information about the idea or situation in question, it is challenging to discern any links between the two perspectives. People's opinions often differ based on their individual experiences, beliefs, values, and understanding of a situation. Consequently, without further context or clarification regarding the particular idea being discussed, it cannot be determined whether these two viewpoints are directly related, completely opposite, or even based on differing understandings of the same concept. In conclusion, due to the lack of information and context provided, it is not possible to tell if the statement \\"It's a terrible idea and I don't want it to work\\" follows from the original assertion.

Translate to English","output":"This passage, \\"23 Что легче сказать: прощаются тебе грехи твои, или сказать: встань и ходи?\\", translates from the Russian language to English as: \\"23 Which is easier, to say: 'Your sins are forgiven', or to say: 'Stand up and walk?'\\" This question deals with the concept of forgiveness and the power of healing. In a broader context, it questions whether it is easier to forgive someone of their transgressions or sins, or to command them to overcome a physical ailment and be able to walk again. Since the desired answer should be detailed and lengthy, let's analyze this question further. The question of whether it is easier to say \\"Your sins are forgiven\\" or \\"Stand up and walk\\" can be approached from different perspectives. Let's examine three common standpoints: a psychological, a theological, and a societal angle. From a psychological perspective, uttering words of forgiveness might be easier for an individual who is empathetic and understanding of human flaws. We know that people make mistakes and may cause harm to others, often unintentionally. Therefore, forgiving someone can provide a sense of relief and closure to both the forgiver and the forgiven. On the other hand, commanding someone to stand and walk can be more difficult, especially if that person has a severe physical disability. It could involve an emotional struggle and an immense responsibility of willpower for the person giving the command. Theologically, this question has strong ties to religious beliefs and teachings. For instance, in Christianity, Jesus is known to have uttered both of these phrases to the sick and the sinful. The act of forgiving sins showcases spiritual power and divine authority, while healing physical ailments reveals a mastery over the physical world. Both expressions hold significant weight, and one may argue that neither is easier to say than the other. Each statement represents a spiritual gift and an exceptional ability to bring about change. From a societal perspective, these two phrases reflect different values and priorities. Forgiving someone of their sins is a personal action that is associated with emotional and spiritual growth. It emphasizes the importance of compassion, understanding, and the capacity to let go of past grievances. In contrast, telling a person to stand and walk often implies that physical health and ability are highly valued, potentially above spiritual well-being. In this context, choosing which phrase is easier to say may depend on an individual's or society's priorities and values. In conclusion, the question \\"Which is easier, to say: 'Your sins are forgiven', or to say: 'Stand up and walk?'\\" explores the complexities of forgiveness, healing, and human power. When evaluated from different perspectives, the difficulty of saying either phrase depends on the psychological, theological, or societal context in which it is presented. The underlying message illustrated by the question is that the power to forgive and the power to heal are both significant, and their importance cannot be underestimated. Ultimately, the question encourages self-reflection and the understanding of the duality of human nature and divine intervention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: It doesn’t matter which equation you decide to work with or even which variable you choose to solve for, as you should find the same solution no matter what. However, you do want to make the process as simple as possible. You should choose the equation that you think will be easiest to work with. For instance, if there is an equation where one of the coefficients is 1, such as x - 3y = 7, you would choose that as it will be easy to solve for ‘x’. For example, let’s say our equations are:  x - 2y = 10 (equation A) and -3x -4y = 10 (equation B). You would choose to work with x - 2y = 10 because the coefficient of x in this equation is 1. Solving for x in equation A would meaning adding 2y to both sides. Therefore, x = 10 + 2y. For this step, you will need to insert (or substitute) your solution for ‘x’ into the other solution that you did not work with. This will allow you to find the other variable, in this case ‘y’. Let’s try it: Insert the ‘x’ of equation B into equation A: -3(10 + 2y) -4y = 10. You can see that we have taken ‘x’ out of the equation and inserted what ‘x’ equals. Now that you have removed one of the variables from the equation, you can solve for the other variable. This is is simply solving a regular one-variable linear equation. Let’s solve ours:  -3(10 + 2y) -4y = 10 so -30 -6y -4y = 10. Combine the y’s: -30 - 10y = 10. Move the -30 over to the other side: -10y = 40. Solve for y: y = -4. To do this, plug your findings for ‘y’, or the first variable, into one of the equations. Then solve for the other variable, in this case ‘x’. Let’s try it:  Solve for ‘x’ in equation A by plugging in y = -4: x - 2(-4) = 10. Simply the equation: x + 8 = 10. Solve for x: x = 2. Plug both of the variables into each equation to make sure that they create true equations. Let’s see if ours work:  Equation A: 2 - 2(-4) = 10 is TRUE. Equation B: -3(2) -4(-4) = 10 is TRUE. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something bigger. In this case, the summary is about solving math problems with two variables, like 'x' and 'y'.

Sourav Chandidas Ganguly ( pronunciation ; born 8 July 1972), affectionately known as Dada (meaning \\"elder brother\\" in Bengali), is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team, Currently, he is appointed as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal and President of the Editorial Board with Wisden India. During his playing career, Ganguly established himself as one of the world's leading batsmen and also one of the greatest captains of the national cricket team. While batting, he was especially prolific through the off side, earning himself the nickname God of the Off Side for his elegant strokeplay square of the wicket and through the covers. Sourav Ganguly is one of the four members of the Indian Premier League's Governing Council, responsible for all the functions of the tournament. Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta, and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness.  Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.  Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under-15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.

Article: Working at the edge of a coal mine in India, a team of Johns Hopkins researchers and colleagues have filled in a major gap in science's understanding of the evolution of a group of animals that includes horses and rhinos. That group likely originated on the subcontinent when it was still an island headed swiftly for collision with Asia, the researchers report today in the online journal Nature Communications.      Modern horses, rhinos, and tapirs belong to a biological group, or order, called Perissodactyla. Also known as \\"odd-toed ungulates,\\" animals in the order have, as their name implies, an uneven number of toes on their hind feet and a distinctive digestive system. Though paleontologists had found remains of Perissodactyla from as far back as the beginnings of the Eocene epoch (about 56 million years ago), their earlier evolution remained a mystery, says Ken Rose, a professor of functional anatomy and evolution at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.      Rose and his research team have for years been excavating mammal fossils in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, but in 2001 he and Indian colleagues began exploring Eocene sediments in Western India because it had been suggested that perissodactyls and some other mammal groups might have originated there. In an open-pit coal mine northeast of Mumbai, they uncovered a rich vein of ancient bones. Rose says he and his collaborators obtained funding from the National Geographic Society to send a research team to the mine site at Gujarat in the far Western part of India for two weeks at a time once every year or two over the past decade.      The mine yielded what Rose says was a treasure trove of teeth and bones for the researchers to comb through back in their home laboratories. Of these, more than 200 fossils belonged to an animal dubbed Cambaytherium thewissi, about which little had been known. The researchers dated the fossils to about 54.5 million years old, making them slightly younger than the oldest known Perissodactyla remains. But, Rose says, the findings provide a window into what a common ancestor of all Perissodactyla would have looked like.      \\"Many of Cambaytherium's features, like the teeth, the number of sacral vertebrae, and the bones of the hands and feet, are intermediate between Perissodactyla and more primitive animals,\\" Rose says. \\"This is the closest thing we've found to a common ancestor of the Perissodactyla order.\\"      Cambaytherium and other finds from the Gujarat coal mine also provide tantalizing clues about India's separation from Madagascar, its lonely migration, and its eventual collision with the continent of Asia as the Earth's plates shifted, Rose says. In 1990, two researchers from Stony Brook University, David Krause and Mary Maas, published a paper suggesting that several groups of mammals that appear at the beginning of the Eocene—including primates and odd- and even-toed ungulates—might have evolved in India while it was isolated. Cambaytherium is the first concrete evidence to support that idea, Rose says. But, he adds, \\"it's not a simple story.\\"      \\"Around Cambaytherium's time, we think India was an island, but it also had primates and a rodent similar to those living in Europe at the time,\\" he says. \\"One possible explanation is that India passed close by the Arabian Peninsula or the Horn of Africa, and there was a land bridge that allowed the animals to migrate. But Cambaytherium is unique and suggests that India was indeed isolated for a while.\\"      Rose said his team was \\"very fortunate that we discovered the site and that the mining company allowed us to work there,\\" although, he added, \\"it was frustrating to know that countless fossils were being chewed up by heavy mining equipment.\\"      When coal extraction was finished, the miners covered the site, he says. His team has now found other mines in the area to continue digging.      Other authors on the study were Luke T. Holbrook of Rowan University, Rajendra S. Rana of Garhwal University, Kishor Kumar of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Katrina E. Jones and Heather E. Ahrens of Johns Hopkins University, Pieter Missiaen of Ghent University, Ashok Sahni of Panjab University, and Thierry Smith of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. ||||| more-in      Horses and rhinos likely originated in the Indian subcontinent, over 54 million years ago, according to a new study.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: COLUMBUS, Ohio--The heart operation taking place in the pale-green operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was unusual. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient.

Paragraph: Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira's origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \\"Island of Timber. \\" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.  Question: \\"What is the name of one of the islands that is part of a landmass that some think once fused the continents of Europe and America?\\" Answer: \\"Madeira\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Madeira\\" is correct based on the paragraph.

Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S..

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Desert plants fall into two sorts according to the way they deal with the problem of surviving drought. There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist  only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents  is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers.    In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros  to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical  or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water. The root system is widespread and shallow, with good reason; only about 3 per cent of the rain that falls on the desert penetrates to any significant depth into soil. A:","output":"Which of the following statements best describes the two categories of desert plants and their adaptations to survive drought conditions?

B) Drought-avoiders are plants that grow only during the rainy season, while drought-resisters are plants that continue to grow during drought spells, as they can locate underground water sources. C) Drought-avoiders are plants that shed their leaves to reduce water loss, while drought-resisters are plants that store water in their leaves or stems to survive long periods without rainfall.

Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world.

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \\"great Alachua Savannah.\\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife. You can see Florida as it was in the early days. Paynes Prairie is a part of our Florida history. It is an example of our Florida natural resources. It is a place for recreation. Paynes Prairie...

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What border is represented at the true 103rd meridian? is inside the article: Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,899 square miles (181,040 km2), with 68,595 square miles (177,660 km2) of land and 1,304 square miles (3,380 km2) of water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian. Cimarron County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, and Kansas., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The border represented at the true 103rd meridian is the Oklahoma/New Mexico border.  The reasoning behind this is provided in the text: The Texas/New Mexico border was originally set along the 103rd meridian as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. However, in the 1890s, more accurate surveying techniques revealed that this border did not line up with the true 103rd meridian.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").  Question: \\"How many people were involved in selecting targets to destroy by plane?\\" Response: \\"Four\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

Given the question: I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of people participated in a geriatrics study. Group D had people over 65 years old, while group Y had people in their 40's in its composition.  Answer this question please: Which group had people with stronger immune systems? The answer is:","output":"Group Y had people with stronger immune systems. Step 1: Understand the context of the question The provided background information states that old age begins in the mid-60s and discusses various aspects of aging, such as physical and mental health. Step 2: Identify the relevant aspects The question focuses on the immune system, which the background tells us becomes less efficient in old age, increasing the risk of serious illnesses. Step 3: Analyze the demographic information of each group Group D consists of people over 65 years old, which falls within the old age category, while Group Y comprises people in their 40's. Step 4: Connect the demographic information with the question's focus Since immune system efficiency decreases in old age (as mentioned in the background information), we can conclude that individuals in Group Y (with a lower age range of 40s) would have stronger immune systems compared to those in Group D (with an age range of over 65 years)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is generally regarded as a leading figure of the \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement of Chinese cinema, a group that also includes such figures as Wang Xiaoshuai, Lou Ye, Wang Quan'an and Zhang Yuan. Can we infer the following? Jia's career is based in American cinema.","output":"No, it cannot be inferred that Jia Zhangke's career is based in American cinema. Instead, he is a renowned Chinese film director and screenwriter who works primarily within the Chinese film industry. The \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement of Chinese cinema indicates that Jia Zhangke, along with his peers such as Wang Xiaoshuai, Lou Ye, Wang Quan'an, and Zhang Yuan, is focused on addressing and exploring the sociopolitical and cultural aspects of contemporary China. This movement was a response to the \\"Fifth Generation\\" directors, who primarily focused on broad historical themes. The \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement is known for its depiction of modern China's urban landscapes, post-socialist consumer culture, and the lives of alienated or marginalized individuals. These directors often employ independent filmmaking techniques, including the use of non-professional actors, handheld cameras, and a fusion of documentary and fiction styles. Their work essentially represents a shift from the elaborate, historical themes of their predecessors, concentrating instead on the contemporary complexities of Chinese society. Jia Zhangke's work reflects these traits, as his films are recognized for their realist approach, such as his international breakthrough film, \\"Platform\\" (2000), which portrays the lives of a small theater troupe in rural China. His other notable works include \\"The World\\" (2004), \\"Still Life\\" (2006), and \\"A Touch of Sin\\" (2013). In Jia's films, we observe the transformation of Chinese society and the conflict between tradition and modernity. While his work has been internationally acclaimed and has made an impact worldwide, Jia's career remains based in the Chinese film industry. Although some collaborations with international production companies or film festivals may occur, this does not change the foundation of his influence and impact within the realm of Chinese cinema. In conclusion, it would be incorrect to infer that Jia Zhangke's career is based in American cinema.

They are debating between getting a dog or a cat when they decide to flip a coin since they can't agree. The coin comes up tails so they are getting a cat. Unbeknownst to Karen, she is allergic to cats. Kelly has no allergies to animals, but Karen has never lived with cats before so she isn't aware that she is allergic to them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will have a stuffy nose more often?  Hint: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. The answer is:","output":"Karen will have a stuffy nose more often. This is due to her previously unknown allergy to cats. As explained in the hint, an allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen. In this case, the allergen is likely related to the cat they adopted for their apartment. Cat allergens can come from their dander, saliva, and urine and can be inhaled or come into contact with sensitive areas. Allergens can cause a range of symptoms, including sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion, and itchy, watery eyes. Since Karen is allergic to cats and now lives with one, her immune system will be triggered to respond to the allergens present. This exposure will cause an inflammatory response, which will result in Karen experiencing symptoms like a stuffy nose more often than her roommate, Kelly, who has no known allergies to animals. In contrast, Kelly, who doesn't have allergies to animals, will not have the same inflammatory responses to the cat allergens and will therefore not experience a stuffy nose, or other allergy-related symptoms, as frequently as Karen. Perhaps Karen should consider getting tested for allergies, consulting a healthcare professional for advice on how to manage her symptoms, and discussing with Kelly any alternative ways to keep the symptoms at bay while still being able to enjoy the company of their new pet. In summary, given the information provided in the paragraph about Karen's previously unknown allergy to cats, it can be concluded that Karen will have a stuffy nose more often when compared to her roommate, Kelly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Asia Parveen: Caused 57 injuries to the child and later claimed her violent outburst was prompted by hormones. A Muslim woman who repeatedly beat a ten-year-old girl with a steel ladle for not reading enough verses of the Koran was jailed yesterday. Asia Parveen, who was five months pregnant at the time, left the child with 57 injuries and later claimed her violent outburst was prompted by  her hormones. The girl managed to escape when Parveen ran to her kitchen for a knife, and was found alone at a bus stop in the early hours of the morning. Parveen, 31, had argued with the girl on August 15 last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court in London heard. She accused the girl of lying about how many verses of the Koran she had read while praying. She then hit the girl with the ten- inch ladle for 45 minutes and forced her to stand with her arms outstretched for four hours. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, escaped when Parveen went to fetch a knife which she brandished, saying she was going  to kill her. She was found four hours later, alone and in the cold at the bus stop, by police. Doctors identified 57 injuries, including marks on her arms, legs, elbows and head, when she was examined at hospital. Parveen, a former professional traditional dancer who had toured worldwide, had been fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan before  the attack. She was considered to be ‘immoral’ by some in the community in Pakistan for her former dancing career and so wanted the girl to take her religious duties seriously. Parveen, a mother of three, accepted causing some of the girl’s injuries with the ladle  but claimed that others must have happened when the girl ‘fell over’. Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said: ‘The girl was praying from the Koran and Mrs Parveen accused her of lying about how many of the verses she had read. ‘She was ten at the time. Mrs Parveen took a metal spoon about ten inches in size and hit the child with it repeatedly, causing extensive bruising over both arms, her legs and head. ‘Mrs Parveen said she was going to kill the girl and ran to get a knife from the kitchen. ‘The girl had no alternative but to leave at around 10pm.’ Jailed: Asia Parveen launched 'a sustained and vicious attack' with a metal ladle. Jailing Parveen, who is now divorced,. for nine months, Judge Martyn Zeidman ignored pleas in a letter from the. child victim to spare her jail. He. said: ‘You need to understand that this was outrageous behaviour and if. you ever attack a child again, you will go to prison for very much. longer. 'Of course the injuries itself were. not life-threatening but there were so many of them and the pictures and. the body plan prepared by the paediatrician demonstrate there were 57. injuries. ‘Having a very young baby should not be seen as a get out of jail card.’ Parveen, who lives in Hackney, East. London, admitted a single count of child cruelty after initially. insisting she had used the spoon only once or twice on the girl’s arms. and bottom. During further court proceedings, she. admitted in a second plea that she had lost her temper after feeling. ‘hormonal’, ‘isolated’ and ‘ashamed’. She claimed the other injuries had been the result of the girl falling over. She also denied threatening to kill the ten-year-old or picking up a knife. Parveen, who was told the verdict by her Punjabi interpreter, collapsed in the dock while being led down to the cells by guards. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

How to cook salmon in the oven  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (177 degrees celsius).  Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper.  Place the salmon fillets on the baking sheet. Options:  (a). Arrange them so that each salmon fillet's body is one quarter-inch (8.9 cm) deep in the baking dish. This will ensure that any juices will end up in the bottom of the pan and not in the salmon fillets.  (b). Arrange them so that they are all at the center of the baking sheet using care as to which side of the fish doesn't have the largest anus (an upside down triangle). The open side of each salmon side will have the biggest anus.  (c). If the fillets still have skin on them, lay them on the sheet with the skin facing down. If the fillets do not have skin on them, it does not matter which side faces down.  (d). Remove the skins from the salmon and scoop some of the flesh out with a spoon into your mixing bowl. Combine the salmon fillets with some olive oil and a pinch of salt, before moving onto the next step.","output":"Option C is the most appropriate next step.

Who played the part of the vulcanologist who warned of impending disaster in the film 'Dantes Peak'?","output":"In the 1997 disaster film 'Dante's Peak,' the role of the vulcanologist who warned of impending disaster was played by Pierce Brosnan. The character's name was Dr. Harry Dalton, a skilled volcanologist working for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Pierce Brosnan is an Irish actor, who gained immense popularity for his portrayal of James Bond in the famous 007 series. As Dr. Harry Dalton in 'Dante's Peak,' Brosnan played a dedicated scientist who tirelessly tried to convince the skeptical townspeople and the local government authorities that a volcanic eruption was imminent and could potentially cause widespread devastation. His character struggled to save the lives of the people living close to Dante's Peak, a fictional volcano located in Washington State. The film, directed by Roger Donaldson and written by Leslie Bohem, also starred actress Linda Hamilton, best known for her role as Sarah Connor in the 'Terminator' series. Hamilton played Rachel Wando, the town's mayor, who eventually teams up with Dr. Dalton to lead the evacuation efforts before the eruption devastates the town. 'Dante's Peak' was released on February 7, 1997, and although the movie received mixed reviews, its thrilling storyline, special effects, and strong performances by both Brosnan and Hamilton ensured success at the box office. The film grossed 178 million worldwide, further cementing Pierce Brosnan's status as a leading actor in the film industry. Despite some discrepancies in the scientific portrayal of volcanic events, 'Dante's Peak' remains an iconic disaster film and a testament to Pierce Brosnan's versatility as an actor."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"A: The United States is divided into various districts based on different categorizations, such as political, judicial, and statistical divisions. Here, we will discuss three main district types: congressional districts, federal judicial districts, and school districts. 1. Congressional Districts:  The United States is divided into 435 congressional districts, each of which elects a member to the U.S. House of Representatives. These districts are apportioned based on the population of each state, as determined by the decennial U.S. Census. The number of districts per state can change after a census due to the changes in population. The District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) are represented by non-voting delegates in the House but do not have congressional districts per se. 2. Federal Judicial Districts: Federal judicial districts are established by the U.S. Congress under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, primarily to handle federal cases, including civil, criminal, and bankruptcy matters. There are currently 94 federal judicial districts, which are grouped into 12 regional circuits. Each state has at least one federal district, while more populous states have multiple districts. For instance, California has four federal judicial districts, while New York and Texas have four and three, respectively. 3. School Districts: School districts in the United States are independent governmental entities responsible for overseeing primary and secondary education within their jurisdictions. There is no fixed number of school districts in the country, as the number varies from state to state and is subject to change due to factors like consolidations, dissolutions, or annexations of districts. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of the 2018-2019 school year, there were approximately 13,588 public school districts across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In summary, the United States is divided into 435 congressional districts, 94 federal judicial districts, and approximately 13,588 school districts. It is essential to note that this information is subject to change, especially with regards to school districts and after each decennial census, which may cause shifts in congressional representation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Josip Broz Tito: His best known wife was Jovanka Broz. Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito, objecting to her energetic personality, opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito's strange relationship with Zinka failed. Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power, she also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children. How old was Jovanka Broz when she married Tito?","output":"Jovanka Broz was 27 years old when she married Josip Broz Tito.

However, by 1914, it separated itself from The Times to become a payable weekly magazine, concentrating on literature and societal issues. Even though it emerged as an independent entity, The Times and the TLS continued to share co-ownership. Moreover, it's worth noting that as of 2012, the TLS is also published by News International, a British-American multinational mass media company. This collaboration mirrors a symbiotic relationship as the TLS cooperates intimately with The Times, its elder sibling newspaper. The extent of the synergy between these two involves the online version of the TLS being hosted on The Times website, a strategic decision that enhances visibility, provides accessibility to a broader audience and consolidates their digital presence through the shared platform.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Information:  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - A wallaby is a small- or mid-sized macropod found in Australia and New Guinea. They belong to the same taxonomic family as kangaroos and sometimes the same genus, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the six largest species of the family. The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.  - Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka.  - Wallaroo is any of three closely related species of moderately large macropod, intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. The word \\"wallaroo\\" is from Dharug \\"walaru\\". In general, a large, slim-bodied macropod of the open plains is called a \\"kangaroo\\"; a small to medium-sized one, particularly if it is relatively thick-set, is a \\"wallaby\\": most wallaroos are only a little smaller than a kangaroo, fairly thickset, and are found in open country. All share a particular habit of stance: wrists raised, elbows tucked close into the body, and shoulders thrown back, and all have a large, black-skinned rhinarium.  - Macropus is a marsupial genus that belongs to the family Macropodidae. It has thirteen extant species which are further divided into three subgenera. The genus includes all terrestrial kangaroos, wallaroos, and several species of wallaby. The term itself is derived from the Ancient Greek , \\"makros\\" \\"long\\" and , \\"pous\\" \\"foot\\". A further eleven extinct species are recognised. The type species is the eastern grey kangaroo.  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands.  - Macropods are marsupials belonging to the family Macropodidae, the kangaroo family, which includes kangaroos, wallabies, tree-kangaroos, pademelons, quokkas, and several others. Macropods are native to the Australian continent (the mainland, Tasmania, New Guinea and nearby islands). Before European settlement of Australia, about 65 species of macropods existed. Six species have since become extinct and a further eleven have been greatly reduced in numbers. Other species (e.g. \\"Simosthenurus\\", \\"Propleopus\\", \\"Macropus titan\\") became extinct after the Australian Aborigines arrived and before the Europeans arrived.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning \\"large foot\\"). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus \\"Macropus\\": the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier.  - The Paleolithic or Palaeolithic; pronunciation: ) Age, Era or Period is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 95% of human technological prehistory. It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by Homo habilis initially, 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000 BP.  - Protemnodon is a genus of megafaunal macropods that existed in Australia , Tasmania , and Papua New Guinea in the Pleistocene . Based on fossil evidence , Protemnodon is thought to have been physically similar to wallabies , but far larger ; Protemnodon hopei was the smallest in the genus weighing about 45 kg , the other species all weighed over 110 kg. Recent analysis of mtDNA extracted from fossils indicates that Protemnodon was closely related to Macropus .  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Papua New Guinea (PNG  Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - Bass Strait is a sea strait separating Tasmania from the Australian mainland, specifically the state of Victoria.  - The Pleistocene (often colloquially referred to as the Ice Age) is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago, spanning the world's most recent period of repeated glaciations. The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology.  - The eastern grey kangaroo (\\"Macropus giganteus\\") is a marsupial found in southern and eastern Australia, with a population of several million. It is also known as the great grey kangaroo and the Forester kangaroo. Although a big eastern grey male typically masses around 66 kg (weight 145 lb.) and stands almost 2 m (6.6 ft.) tall, the scientific name, \\"Macropus giganteus\\" (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the red kangaroo of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to 90 kg.

This is where you'll get a lot of information on the product and be able to compare to other items in the store.  Start by looking at the ingredient list.  You'll want to know exactly what you're feeding your child (especially if you're worried about allergies or sensitivities).  This is usually found on the back or side of the cereal container. Regardless of what grain you're choosing, go for 100% whole grains.  If the label says white rice or hulled wheat, these are not 100% whole grains.  You will also see the nutrition fact panel on baby cereals.  If your child needs to meet a certain calorie level to improve growth, this is where you'll find out how many calories this cereal contains per serving. Many health professions like pediatricians suggest starting babies on fortified cereals.  These products have certain nutrients added to them to help them be a more nutrient dense food for your child.  Look for cereals that are fortified with iron.  You might find this as a \\"call-out\\" on the front of the package.  Double check there is iron on the ingredient list and on the nutrition fact panel.  Babies need about 10 – 11 mg of iron per day.  You may also see cereals that are fortified with DHA or EPA.  These are optional fortifications; however, both of these healthy fats help support the development of your baby's brain and immune system.  DHA is needed for brain, eye, and nervous system development. DHA accumulates in the brain during the first two years of life. The brain grows quickly at this time of life.  Some infant cereals even advertise that they contain probiotics.  Although this is only an optional fortification, some studies show that probiotics may help infants with colic, diarrhea or eczema. Another option that you'll see on store shelves is organic baby cereal.  Decide whether or not you want to feed your child organic or conventional baby cereal.  Organic baby cereals are produced the same way that other organic foods are.  They are not raised or farmed with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.  Feeding your baby an organic cereal may limit their exposure to these pesticides. There are different organic labels you'll see in the store. \\"100% organic\\" can be used to label a product that contains 100% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water which are considered natural). \\"Organic\\" can be used to label any product that contains a minimum of 95% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water). Up to 5% of the ingredients may be inorganic, and are not commercially available as organic. \\"Made with organic ingredients\\" means they contain at least 70% organically produced ingredients. When it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between organic and conventional baby cereal.  The nutrients are identical. Health professionals generally recommend you choose organic if you feel that is most important; however, it's better to focus on finding a cereal that contains adequate fortification and is something you and your baby will enjoy. If you don't find a baby cereal in-store that you think is appropriate for your child, consider making your own baby cereal.  This is not very difficult, but does take some advanced planning.  To make your own homemade baby cereal, start by choosing what grain you'd like to use.  Brown rice is the most common grain, but you can also use oats or multigrain cereals.  Blend 1/4 cup of your chosen grain in a food processor until it becomes a powder or the consistency of flour. Mix this with about 1 cup of water, breast milk or formula.  Bring to a low simmer and whisk for a few constantly for about 10 minutes.  Taste the cereal to make sure there are not uncooked pieces. Allow your homemade cereal to cool completely or to be only room temperature.  Serve to your child within 24 hours.","output":"To choose the best healthy and nutritious baby cereal, start by examining the food label, which contains essential information to compare with other products. The ingredient list is crucial for understanding what you are feeding your child, especially if they have allergies or sensitivities. Always opt for 100% whole grains, such as brown rice or whole wheat, and avoid white rice or hulled wheat. The nutrition fact panel on baby cereals indicates the calorie content per serving, which can help ensure your child meets the necessary calorie levels for growth. Health professionals, including pediatricians, often recommend fortified cereals, which are rich in added nutrients like iron, DHA, and EPA. Iron is particularly important, as babies require 10-11 mg per day. DHA and EPA are optional fortifications that help support the development of your baby's brain and immune system. DHA is essential for brain, eye, and nervous system development, especially during the first two years of life. Probiotics are another optional fortification that may benefit infants with colic, diarrhea, or eczema. When deciding between organic or conventional baby cereals, consider the levels of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers used during production. Organic cereals are produced without these harmful substances, limiting your baby's exposure. The different organic labels - \\"100% organic,\\" \\"organic,\\" and \\"made with organic ingredients\\" - indicate the percentage of organic ingredients in the product. However, there is no nutritional difference between organic and conventional baby cereals. The priority should be to find a fortified cereal that suits your preferences and your baby's needs. If you cannot find a suitable option in stores, consider making homemade baby cereal with brown rice, oats, or multigrain cereals. Simply blend your chosen grain into a powder, mix with water, breast milk, or formula, and cook gently for about 10 minutes. Ensure there are no uncooked pieces and serve the cooled cereal within 24 hours."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Northern Germany is the region in the north of Germany. Its exact area is not precisely or consistently defined but varies depending on whether one is taking a linguistic, geographic, socio-cultural or historic standpoint.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - The new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.  - Holy Moses is a German thrash metal band. They are well noted for being fronted by Sabina Classen (it is rare for a woman to be a singer in thrash metal) and for being one of the very first German thrash metal bands.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany. The band is a pioneering force in the power metal genre, and their second and third studio albums, \\"\\" and \\"\\", are considered masterpieces of the genre.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union.

Context: Multiple ischemic lesions identified by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been shown to predict high risk of future ischemic events. However, the importance of lesion age has not been factored into this risk. Our goal was to evaluate whether the presence of ischemic lesions of varying ages identified by DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) suggests a higher risk of future ischemic events.', 'Patients with acute stroke and TIA presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset who had a baseline and 1-month follow-up MRI were enrolled in the study. Acute ischemic lesions were divided into DWI positive with ADC low lesions and DWI positive with ADC normalized lesions. The baseline MRI and the presence of new lesions on the follow-up MRI were analyzed.', 'A total of 360 patients were prospectively enrolled, and all had appropriate imaging. Two hundred twenty-three were excluded as there were no DWI lesions, they received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or they did not have the 30-day follow-up MRI. One hundred seventeen patients had DWI lesions of one age (DWI positive with either ADC low lesions or ADC normalized lesions alone) and 20 had lesions of varying ages (DWI positive lesions with reduced and normalized ADC) on the baseline MRI. Patients with multiple DWI lesions of varying ages were at more risk of having new lesions on the 30-day MRI compared with those having lesions of the same age (relative risk = 3.6; 95% CI 1.9 to 6.8). Multiple DWI lesions of varying ages (odds ratio [OR] 6.6; 95% CI 2.3 to 19.1) and cardioembolic stroke subtype (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 8.7) were independently associated with new lesion recurrence by multiple logistic regression analysis. Answer: The presence of multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions of varying ages suggests very active early recurrence over time and portends a higher early risk of future ischemic events.

The statement highlights the importance of ensuring that these rights are respected and protected, for they form the basis of a democratic and just society. Below is an analysis of the various freedoms mentioned in the statement and the implications of the restrictions on them. 1. Freedoms of thought, conscience, and religion: These fundamental freedoms allow people to form, hold, and express their beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination. They also encompass the freedom to change one's religion or belief and to practice one's faith in private and public. Restrictions on these freedoms may lead to severe consequences, such as limiting social, cultural, and intellectual progress, as well as fostering intolerance, enmity, and divisions within society. 2. Freedom of opinion and expression: This right is directly related to the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media, regardless of frontiers. Unceasing restrictions on this freedom may lead to censorship, the suppression of dissent, and a lack of transparency in governance, eventually resulting in a stifled democratic process, curtailed individual development, and diminished creativity. 3. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association: The rights to gather peacefully, form associations, and express collective interests are essential to a vibrant civil society and function as a channel for public participation in decision-making processes. Limitations on these freedoms can limit the voice of the people, affect the balance of power, and lead to corruption and abuse of authority by those in positions of power. 4. Access to information for everyone: Transparency and access to information are pivotal in building a well-informed and engaged populace. Restrictions on these aspects may lead to misinformation, concealment of illegal activities, and the obstruction of justice, creating an environment ripe for corruption and the infringement of human rights. 5. Freedom of movement within the country and travel abroad: Ensuring the right to move without unjustified restrictions allows individuals to exercise their personal freedoms and contribute to the economic and social well-being of the nation. Restricting this freedom may result in negative impacts on freedom of choice, family unity, and cultural exchange, as well as limiting opportunities for education, work, and political participation. In conclusion, severe and unceasing restrictions on these fundamental rights can lead to significant detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. Upholding these freedoms is essential for fostering a democratic, just, and progressive society, where its members can pursue their personal and collective aspirations without fear or hindrance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home in New York City to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down. During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Coal is loaded into the firebox - The boiler produces steam under high pressure - The steam generated in the boiler flows down into a cylinder - Just ahead of the wheels, pushing a tight-fitting plunger, the piston - The piston is connected to one or more of the locomotive&#x27;s wheels through a kind of arm-elbow-shoulder joint called a crank and connecting rod - As the piston pushes, the crank and connecting rod turn the locomotive&#x27;s wheels and power the train along - An outlet valve opens and the piston pushes the steam back through the cylinder and out up the locomotive&#x27;s chimney -   Question: suppose less coal available happens, how will it affect LESS power produced by the steam engine.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less If there is less coal available, it will directly impact the power produced by the steam engine. Here's a detailed explanation of how this happens: 1. With less coal available, the amount of coal loaded into the firebox will be reduced. The firebox is responsible for heating the water in the boiler, producing high-pressure steam.  2. When there is less coal in the firebox, the burning temperature will not be as high, and the boiler will not be able to produce the same amount of steam under high pressure as it would with a sufficient amount of coal.  3. As a result, the steam generated in the boiler will have less energy, and when it flows down into the cylinder, the force exerted on the piston will be lower.  4. Since the piston is connected to the locomotive's wheels through the crank and connecting rod, a decrease in the force exerted by the steam on the piston will lead to a lower turning force on the crank and connecting rod. This, in turn, will result in less power being transmitted to the wheels.  5. With less power being transferred to the wheels, the locomotive will not be able to propel the train along with the same amount of force and speed. 6. Additionally, the reduced steam pressure in the cylinder may also result in the outlet valve not opening as effectively, which can have an impact on the overall efficiency of the steam engine. Therefore, when there is less coal available, it will lead to less power being produced by the steam engine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Russian: В конце XIX и начале XX веков, царизм активно использовал военные подразделения для подавления революционных и национально-освободительных движений, особенно во время Революции 1905-1907 годов. В этот период российская империя проходила через серьезные социальные, политические и экономические напряжения, что приводило к массовым протестам и волнениям на национальной основе. Одной из главных причин возникновения революционных движений было насилие и эксплуатация царской администрации, ужесточение цензуры и подавление любых возможных проявлений свободы и независимости. Царская власть создавала все больше и больше слоев недовольных людей, включая крестьян, рабочих, студентов и интеллигенцию. В этой связи, царизм в своей попытке сохранить свою власть и подавить революционное марево использовал военные подразделения для борьбы с возросшими социальными напряжениями. Военные части демонстрировали строгую верность и лояльность царью, были хорошо обучены в тактике подавления массовых протестов и быстро реагировали на любые знаки возмущения. Подавление Революции 1905-1907 годов было жестоким и кровавым, с тысячами убитых и раненых на обеих сторонах конфликта. Военные подразделения действовали беспощадно – полиция и войска открывали огонь без предупреждения, а арестованных мирных жителей и революционеров ждало мучительное заключение или казнь. Однако, несмотря на весь этот ужас, использование военных сил для подавления незадачливых революций и движений, долго сохранить власть царизму не удалось. В результате Серебряного века русской культуры, а затем и расширяющегося присутствия идеологии социализма, народное недовольство продолжало расти. Наконец, в 1917 году, каждая из тех же самых групп, которые участвовали в Революции 1905-1907 годов, объединились еще раз, и единая революционная волна положила конец царскому режиму России и привела к формированию новой, советской власти."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Raging Bull Movie plot: The film opens in 1964, where an older and fatter Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) practices his stand-up comic routine before his debut at a comedy nightclub. A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.

Question 1: How do intelligent people intimidate others with their intelligence? Example? Question 2: \\"What does it mean to be 'people smart'?\\" Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They deal with different aspects of intelligence and human behavior. I will provide detailed explanations for each question to clarify the differences. Question 1: How do intelligent people intimidate others with their intelligence? Example? Intelligent people can sometimes intimidate others by using their intellectual prowess in ways that make others feel inferior or unable to match their cognitive abilities. This can be done intentionally or unintentionally. Here are some ways intelligent people might intimidate others: 1. Using complicated language: An intelligent person might use advanced vocabulary, technical jargon, or complex sentence structures that others struggle to understand. This can create a sense of distance between them and those they communicate with, making others feel inadequate. Example: A scientist talking about their research findings using a lot of technical terms and complex phrases that a layperson might not understand, making the layperson feel intimidated and unsure of their own knowledge. 2. Displaying extensive knowledge: Intelligent people can have a vast repository of knowledge across various subjects, and they might display this information in conversations and debates, making others feel overwhelmed or less informed. Example: During a group discussion about climate change, an intelligent person could share intricate details about the subject and cite numerous studies and facts, making others feel like they lack enough information to contribute meaningfully to the conversation. 3. Condescending attitude: Some intelligent people might develop a sense of superiority over those they deem less intelligent. They might express themselves in a condescending manner, belittle others' opinions, or dismiss them outright. Example: A professor in a university setting might dismiss a student's question or opinion as \\"irrelevant\\" or \\"naive\\" without even considering its merit. Question 2: \\"What does it mean to be 'people smart'?\\" Being \\"people smart\\" refers to possessing strong interpersonal and social skills. People who are people-smart have a keen understanding of others' emotions, motivations, and behaviors and can effectively navigate social situations, build relationships, and work well in teams. Some elements of being people smart include: 1. Emotional intelligence: People who are people-smart can quickly perceive and understand the emotions of others and respond accordingly. They know how to empathize, provide support, and adapt their communication style to connect with others on an emotional level. 2. Communication skills: People-smart individuals excel at both verbal and non-verbal communication. They can express their thoughts and feelings clearly, listen actively, and interpret body language and other non-verbal cues. 3. Conflict resolution: Being people-smart means effectively managing conflicts and finding solutions that satisfy all parties involved. People with these skills are good at maintaining harmony in relationships and addressing disagreements in a constructive manner. 4.

Working the night shift a few nights a month can do more than leave your eyes bleary-eyed ,suggests a study on Wednesday.     It just might increase your risk of color1ectal cancer .Nurses who worked the night shift at least three times a month for t5 years or more were 35%more likely to develop that type of cancer than nurses who never worked nights,Harvard University researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.     The finding,from the ongoing Nurses Health Study,is the first to link night shift work with a higher risk of color1ectal cancer,expected to kill 57,100 Americans this, according to the American Cancer Society.Another research,including a report out of the Nurses Health Study, has suggested that working night shifts increases women's breast cancer risk.     The researchers asked 78,586 nurses whether they had ever worked three or more night shifts a month.The nurses indicated whether they had done so for less than 15 years or 15 years or more.The scientists followed the women to see who developed color1ectal cancer.     Researchers believe that lowered levels of melatonin might increase night-shift workers' cancer risk.Melatonin levels usually reach the highest point in the middle of the night. Turn on the lights,though,and  _ dropped measurably in just 10 minutes,says Richard Stevens a cancer epidemiologist at the University of Connecticut who did not take part in the new study.After two weeks of continuous nightly exposure to light,humans experience a sharp drop in melatonin production,Nurses Health Study researchers write.    In the lab,melatonin appears to stop tumor growth.Other studies suggest that color1ectal cancer patients have lower blood levels of melatonin than healthy people,the authors write.However,that could be a result of the disease,not a cause of it.Stevens says. According to Nurses Health Study,which of the following statements is NOT true? A) Working on night shifts will do harm to nurses' health. B) Nurses who don't work at night don't suffer color1ectal cancer. C) Nurses working on night shifts will have a higher risk of color1ectal cancer D) Working on night shifts will increase women's breast cancer risk The answer to this question is:","output":"B) Nurses who don't work at night don't suffer colorectal cancer. This statement is NOT true because the Nurses Health Study does not claim that nurses who never work night shifts are completely free from colorectal cancer. Instead, the study indicates that those who work night shifts at least three times a month for 15 years or more have a 35% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who never work night shifts. It does not imply that those who don't work at night are entirely exempt from the risk of this type of cancer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Starman Context: Launched in 1977, the Voyager 2 space probe carried a gold phonographic disk with a message of peace, inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth. The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth. However, instead of greeting the alien craft, the US government shoots it down. Crashing in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin, the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of glowing energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen). While there, the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches. The alien \\"Starman\\" (Jeff Bridges) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona. Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape. Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm.

The Science Of 'Happily Ever After': 3 Things That Keep Love Alive As Daniel Jones, author of Love Illuminated, explains: we spend youth asking “How do I find love?” and midlife asking “How do I get it back?” Anyone in a relationship or who plans on being in one needs to know how to keep love alive over the long term. But how do you learn the secret to this? Everyone is happy to explain “how they met” but few give the details on “how they stayed together.” So let’s look at what science has to say. Aside from being the epitome of lazy writing, “happily ever after” is not simple. Ty Tashiro explains that couples in their first year of marriages score 86% for marriage satisfaction. By the seventh year, it’s under 50%. Yes, about 50% of couples get divorced. Another 10-15% separate but do not file paperwork. And 7 more percent are chronically unhappy. So the real stat is two-thirds of marriages do not live “happily ever after.” Via The Science of Happily Ever After: What Really Matters in the Quest for Enduring Love: The divorce rate often reported by the media is 50 percent, which is based on Census Bureau data. However, census data does not capture the 10 to 15 percent of couples who permanently separate but do not file formal paperwork for a legal divorce. This means that a conservative estimate of the divorce and permanent separation rate is 60 percent. Add the additional 7 percent of chronically unhappy couples who do not divorce or permanently separate but are consistently unhappy in their marriage, and this means that two-thirds of all married couples do not live happily ever after. Why is marriage so hard over the long term? One of the main reasons is what science calls it “habituation.” Which is a fancy way of saying we get bored. Early on, when a couple can finish each other’s sentences it’s romantic. But over time “predictable” is a huge negative. Chris Rock gets the point across humorously in this video (NSFW): Robert Greene, author of The Art of Seduction, explains that surprise is key to romantic feelings: Seduction involves a degree of surprise, which is generally the first thing that disappears after you’ve been in a relationship, and why there’s no more seducing that goes on. Everything is familiar and you’re no longer surprised by the other person. So is there any way to bring those tingles back? Hold on a sec. We can learn something here. What do researchers find when they compare at 50 arranged marriages and 50 “love” marriages? Love marriages start out happier — but that declines quickly. Arranged marriages start out less happy, but after 10 years, they’re happier than love marriages. And stay that way. Via The Art of Choosing: The couples who had married for love and been together less than a year averaged a score of 70 points out of a possible 91 on the love scale, but these numbers steadily fell over time. The love couples who had been married ten years or longer had an average score of only 40 points. In contrast, the couples in arranged marriages were less in love at the outset, averaging 58 points, but their feelings increased over time to an average score of 68 at the ten or more years mark. What’s the secret behind the long term success of arranged marriages? They have to work at it. They don’t passively rely on “magic” and intense emotion. They have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to make it work. That process of discovery is ostensibly the fun of courtship, too, except that in arranged marriage the goal is to figure out how to be married, not whether to marry. Research shows expecting a fairy tale relationship is a prescription for disappointment. Via 100 Simple Secrets of Great Relationships: Elements of fairy tales such as Cinderella were present in 78 percent of people’s beliefs about romantic love. Those people were more likely to have experienced disillusionment, devastation, and angst in their relationships than were those who gave less credence to fairy tales. – Lockhart 2000 Feeling like it’s all magic means it’s out of your control — and that without that initial magic, it’s hopeless. The happiness of arranged marriages means a couple can make magic if they try. So you need to actively keep the marriage happy. How do you do that? Look at your spouse as something you purchased “as-is.” Research shows trying to change them doesn’t work: …when participants (N = 160) focused their relationship improvement attempts on changing the partner, individuals reported more negative improvement strategies, lower improvement success, and, in turn, more negative relationship evaluations… results suggest that targeting the partner may do more harm than good despite that relationship evaluations pivot on whether the partner produces change. John Gottman, researcher and author of The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, says 69% of a couple’s problems are perpetual. These problems don’t go away yet many couples keep arguing about them year after year. Via The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: Most marital arguments cannot be resolved. Couples spend year after year trying to change each other’s mind – but it can’t be done. This is because most of their disagreements are rooted in fundamental differences of lifestyle, personality, or values. By fighting over these differences, all they succeed in doing is wasting their time and harming their marriage. So if you can’t change them and they won’t change you, how can you reduce the bad stuff? You can’t. But you don’t need to. The best relationships are more about increasing the good than reducing the bad. Divorce may have less to do with an increase in conflict and more to do with a decrease in positive feelings. Via Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being: Shelly Gable, professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has demonstrated that how you celebrate is more predictive of strong relations than how you fight. Okay, so you need to increase the good times. What’s the best way to do that? (This part is exciting. I mean, literally.) Think a pleasant date night is all it takes to keep love alive? Researchers did a 10 week study comparing couples that engaged in “pleasant” activities vs “exciting” activities. Pleasant lost. Via For Better: How the Surprising Science of Happy Couples Can Help Your Marriage Succeed: Those who had undertaken the “exciting” date nights showed a significantly greater increase in marital satisfaction than the “pleasant” date night group… Why would doing anything exciting have such a big effect on a relationship? Because we’re lousy about realizing where our feelings are coming from. Excitement from any source will be associated with the person you’re with, even if they’re not the cause of it. As happiness researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky explains, excitement experienced mutually brings the tingles back. Via The Myths of Happiness: What Should Make You Happy, but Doesn’t, What Shouldn’t Make You Happy, but Does: …Whether the couples were only dating or long-married, the ones who did the shared novel activity were more likely than the ones who did the shared neutral activity to agree to statements like “I feel happy when I am doing something to make my partner happy” and “I feel ‘tingling’ and ‘an increased heartbeat’ when I think of my partner” after the activity than before. So no boring, lame date nights. Go do something exciting. Go dancing together or anything else you can both participate in as a couple. Keeping love alive can be tricky. You need to actively work at it and it’s more important to increase the good then to reduce the bad. And the best way to do that is by increasing excitement. So you’re hopping on roller coasters and going white water rafting — but what do you need to do when you’re there? Pretend you’re on your first date. Studies show pretending time with a romantic partner was a first date makes it more enjoyable for you and for your partner: Across a series of studies, participants underestimated how good they would feel in situations that required them to put their best face forward… participants who were instructed to engage in self-presentation felt happier after interacting with their romantic partner than participants who were not given this instruction… Why? On first dates we make an effort to impress. And we’re full of hope. Love means being a little delusional (Some researchers even think love might qualify as a mental illness.) Thinking your partner is better than they really are makes for longer, better relationships. Via The Science of Love: Sandra Murray and her colleagues have been studying romantic relationships now for several decades, and have found that idealising one’s partner is a sure recipe for marital success; moreover, the higher one’s ideals are and the more one idealises one’s partner, the more satisfied one is with the relationship – and the longer it is likely to last.

The owners of Germany's Die Zeit and Handelsblatt had claimed that AdBlock Plus's product was anti-competitive and threatened their ability to make money. But a court in Hamburg ruled that users do have the right to use the plug-in. The judgement has implications for other disputes involving the tool. \\"The Hamburg court decision is an important one because it sets a precedent that may help us avoid additional lawsuits and expenses defending what we feel is an obvious consumer right: giving people the ability to control their own screens by letting them block annoying ads and protect their privacy,\\" wrote AdBlock Plus's project manager, Ben Williams, on its blog. \\"Now that the legalities are out of the way, we want to reach out to other publishers and advertisers and content creators and encourage them to work with Adblock Plus rather than against us.\\" However, the publishers have indicated that they intend to fight on. \\"We are still convinced that AdBlock Plus is an illegal and anti-competitive practice,\\" they said in a joint statement. \\"It infringes the freedom of the press. Therefore, we will await the written reasons for the judgment, analyse them and examine the prospects of an appeals procedure.\\" AdBlock Plus - which is owned by the Cologne-based firm Eyeo - faces three separate but related cases involving the media groups, ProSiebenSat.1, RTL Interactive and Axel Springer. The recent court case had contested the legality of AdBlock Plus's software suppressing adverts from the pages of the Zeit Online, Handelsblatt and Wirtschafts Woche news sites. Their publishers had sought damages, but said their motivation was to challenge the software provider's wider business model. \\"We are, of course, questioning the offer [of] Adblock Plus in general,\\" Ebba Schroder, a spokeswoman for Zeitverlag Gerd Bucerius told the BBC. While AdBlock Plus offers its web browser add-on to the public for free, it makes money by operating a \\"white list\\" of adverts that it allows to get through its filters. Such ads must meet certain criteria, for instance they must not include animations or sounds and cannot be pop-ups that cover other content. Website operators that want ads on their site added to the white list must seek permission. Although AdBlock Plus states that \\"no one can buy their way onto the white list\\", it does charge fees for what it terms \\"support services\\", the details of which are not made public. In February, the Financial Times reported that one unnamed media company had said it had been asked to pass on the equivalent of 30% of the extra revenues it would have made by having ads on its platform unblocked. That has led some critics to claim that the Eyeo is engaged in a \\"racket\\". But the firm insists that term is \\"imprecise and wrong\\". It highlights that its service has proved popular with many users, with AdBlock Plus having been downloaded nearly 400 million times. It also notes that it does not charge fees to smaller businesses and blogs, and allows users to block its white-listed ads if desired. \\"If we are racketeers we are terrible racketeers because 90% of the people on the white list don't pay anything and the criteria is the same for everyone,\\" Mr Williams told the BBC. \\"[The ruling] is living proof of the unalienable right of every user to enjoy online self-determination.\\" However, one lawyer, who is not involved in the German cases, noted that other European courts might not necessarily take the same view. \\"The Hamburg court based its decision on the provisions of EU Law... other national courts in EU member states must do likewise, but are not bound to reach the same legal conclusions,\\" said Paul Henty from the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. \\"There could also be different factual or economic circumstances in those jurisdictions which lead to a different result. \\"Nonetheless, the Hamburg judgment may be persuasive as an authority and will certainly be a boon to Eyeo in similar AdBlock disputes.\\" Summary:","output":"A court in Hamburg has ruled that users have the right to use AdBlock Plus, stating that it was not anti-competitive, in a case involving Germany's Die Zeit and Handelsblatt, who claimed that the product threatened their ability to make money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds?  Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] A:","output":"A: Bob's town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds.

His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The father of Zipoetes was Bas, the native king of Bithynia who maintained the independence of Bithynia after Alexander the Great's conquests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Banality of Robbing the Jews PARIS â The recent discovery of more than 1,400 prized paintings in the Munich residence of Cornelius Gurlitt, an art collector whose father collaborated with the Nazis, has brought the pillage of the Jews back into the limelight. Yet the bulk of anti-Semitic looting during World War II was at once much more banal and more widespread. In Paris, the plunder of Jewish possessions began with the arrival of German troops in June 1940. At first, it applied only to art collections. But as soon as the Final Solution was devised in January 1942, the confiscations spread to the entire Jewish population, most of which comprised poor immigrants from Eastern Europe. Stripping Jews of their belongings was part and parcel of the effort to destroy them; pillage was an essential tool of extermination. But what would be done with these items? Could they be reused, or were they too Jewish for that? Were the dishes and the blankets that had been touched by Jews fit for use by Aryans? In Berlin in February 1942, Hitler himself ordered Alfred Rosenberg, who had been overseeing the looting of artworks throughout Western Europe, to entirely empty the apartments of Jews who had been deported or arrested, or had fled. The spoils would then be sent back to the Reich. This widespread plunder, known as MÃ¶bel Aktion, occurred in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. From 1942 to 1944, at least 70,000 dwellings were emptied; in Paris 38,000 apartments were stripped bare by French moving companies at the request of the German authorities. It took 674 trains to transport the loot to Germany. Some 2,700 train cars supplied Hamburg alone. Everything was taken: toys, dishes, family photos, tools, light bulbs. The goods were placed in crates and taken to warehouses and sorting centers specifically established for this purpose in the heart of Paris. Pianos were stored in the cellars of the Palais de Tokyo in the 16th arrondissement. Porcelains and fabrics went nearby, to Rue de Bassano. Books and musical scores were gathered at 104 Rue de Richelieu, furniture at the Quai de la Gare. The plunder of the Jews spread far beyond the famous Jeu de Paume and Louvre museums, the main gathering sites for looted art. With German soldiers busy fighting on the Eastern Front, the Nazis in Paris were short-staffed for the sorting and crating required for MÃ¶bel Aktion. So they turned three warehouses into work camps. And they resorted to Jewish prisoners from the Drancy internment camp, a vast cluster of lodgings under construction just outside the city, and an antechamber to Auschwitz. From 1943 to 1944, nearly 800 Jewish men and women worked â ate, slept, lived â among these objects. Some saw their own possessions or those of family members pass before their eyes, and at that moment understood that they, too, had been slated for internment or deportation. The contents of each apartment were divided into two groups. Damaged objects or personal ones, like papers or family photos, were burned almost daily in a bonfire at the Quai de la Gare. The other items were sorted and classified by category, rather than source. A saucepan taken from one family would be added to a stack of other saucepans rather than kept in the original set. Stripped of their provenance, items lost their identity. Belongings became goods. The supervisors of MÃ¶bel Aktion set aside the most appealing items â porcelain, fine linens, fur coats â for themselves and their friends. Former prisoners from the sorting work camps later described regular inspections by German soldiers; they would come to shop âjust like at the Galeries Lafayette,â the Parisian department store. Detainees who had been tailors, cobblers or leather workers before their arrest were forced to make luxury clothes for the Nazi dignitaries and their wives. Shipments of spoons, dishes, clothes and other items were regularly sent on to Germany. They were distributed to German civilians as compensation for losses caused by the Allied bombings or to support their immigration eastward, where they were sent to populate newly conquered territories. But the systematic looting and redistribution of everyday goods of little value and often in poor condition suggest a motivation that goes well beyond economic calculation in a time of hardship. Indeed, several Nazi services, including those of Hermann GÃ¶ring, regularly questioned the financial rationale of MÃ¶bel Aktion. If the project endured nonetheless itâs because one of its fundamental objectives was to destroy all trace of the Jewsâ very existence. Since the end of the war, the French and German governments have offered some indemnities, though often partial, to the small number of looted owners or their descendants who have asked for compensation. The goods themselves could not be retrieved. Unlike stolen works of art â some of which were preserved and continue to resurface â the colossal spoils of that other, mundane looting have vanished. Either they have been destroyed, or they remain with German families, who to this day probably have no idea where they came from. Sarah Gensburger is a social scientist at Franceâs National Center for Scientific Research and the author of âImages of Plunder: An Album of the Looting of Jews in Paris.â This article was translated by Edward Gauvin from the French. What was this article about?","output":"The article discusses the widespread and systematic looting of Jewish possessions during World War II, explaining how it was not only a theft of valuables, but also a method of eradicating the existence of Jews. Key points being raised are the scope it took - how it moved from targeting artwork to encompassing every Jewish possession - and the purpose it served in the Nazi Final Solution. German troops began the confiscation operation, known as Möbel Aktion, at the arrival of Paris in June 1940. Initially, they focused on art collections but, with Hitler's order in 1942, they began to confiscate every belonging from the deported or arrested Jews. This operation was implemented not only in France, but also in Belgium and the Netherlands.  Between 1942 and 1944, at least 70,000 dwellings were stripped, with 38,000 being in Paris alone. The stolen belongings were transported to Germany using more than 674 trains, showcasing the vast scale of this operation. Everything from toys and dishes to family photos and light bulbs was taken, with these possessions going to warehouses and sorting centers in Paris. Because the Nazis in Paris were short-staffed, they turned three warehouses into work camps and used Jewish prisoners to sort and crate the stolen goods. From 1943 to 1944, nearly 800 Jewish men and women worked in these camps, often encountering their own stolen possessions. The article explains how these stolen items were categorized not by source but by type, causing the belongings to lose their identity and become mere goods. German soldiers and their acquaintances took the most appealing items for themselves, turning these locations into shops for their own pleasure. Items were then shipped to Germany to be distributed among German civilians, presenting the looted belongings as compensation for losses or immigration support. Interestingly, despite the questionable financial rationale behind the Möbel Aktion, it continued. This was due to its overarching goal - exterminating Jews by erasing all traces of their existence.  Despite some attempts at offering indemnities for the looting, the goods themselves have been impossible to retrieve. Unlike stolen works of art that continue to resurface, these ransacked everyday items are either destroyed or remain with German families unaware of their provenance. Thus, the article illustrates the dual purpose of Möbel Aktion: not only dispossessing Jews materially but also culturally erasing Jewish existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell below forecasts to 49.6 in November, down from the previous month's reading of 49.8. A reading below the 50-mark indicates contraction in the sector, while one above suggests growth. China's factories have struggled to gain momentum in a slowing economy. The Asian giant is headed for its slowest growth in a quarter of a century this year and economists are concerned that it will miss Beijing's official growth target of 7%. Activity in its vast manufacturing sector shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November and hit a three-year low. The government is trying to move China from an export-driven economy to a consumption-based one. China's manufacturing sector is a key gauge of how the economy is doing. It was the driving force of economic growth for decades and helped China become the workshop of the world. As Chinese factories pumped millions of cheap goods out at a record pace, income levels on the mainland rose for workers, creating a brand new middle class. But now demand for Chinese goods is drying up - both inside and outside of China, which has led to these weaker figures. Beijing has been under pressure to boost slowing economic growth in the country especially in the crucial manufacturing sector. And so over the last few months the government has released a raft of stimulus measures to boost growth - including cutting interest rates six times and fast-tracking investment approvals for new building projects and factory plants. But so far these measures don't appear to have worked. Activity in the country's services sector did pick up last month which helped offset the decline in manufacturing. The services PMI rose to 53.6 from 53.1 in October. Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG, said the improvement in the services PMI had reinforced the view that the sector is \\"cushioning\\" growth. Easing measures by the government may also be supporting growth, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at research firm Capital Economics. \\"There are some hints that accelerating credit growth and fiscal spending, on the back of recent policy easing, may have continued to support investment growth last month,\\" he said in a note on Tuesday. China's central bank has cut interest rates six times since last November, among a series of other measures to stimulate the economy. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI contracted for the ninth month in a row in November, but factory activity shrank at a slower pace than the pervious month. The private PMI survey, which focuses more on small to medium-size businesses, was up to 48.6 in November, from 48.3 in October. In reaction to the manufacturing data, the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.2% to 3,438.32 points - bucking the higher trend in the rest of Asia.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following people has a book of the Bible named after them: Mary, Luke or Jesus? Context: Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius). The answer is:","output":"Luke. The context mentions the \\"circumcision (Luke 2:22)\\" which is a reference to the Gospel of Luke in the Bible. Therefore, among Mary, Luke, and Jesus, Luke has a book of the Bible named after him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However he has left behind a flute that only has six holes. The King throws it into the fireplace in his room, which starts to emit green smoke. When the fire is put out, Peewit retrieves the flute from the ashes unharmed. He cleans it and starts playing it for the whole castle realizing that it causes everyone to dance when it is played. That night a man named Matthew McCreep learns from the merchant that the same flute he had been looking for is at the castle. He heads over to the castle and steals the flute from Peewit. The king sends Peewit and the young knight Johan out to catch McCreep who uses the flute to rob people of their money. However McCreep uses the flute to stop them. Johan and Peewit then go to the house of Homnibus the wizard. Using a spell called Hypnokenesis, the wizard sends Johan and Peewit to Smurfland where the magic flute was built. Upon arriving they meet a smurf who leads them to the village. Papa Smurf greets the two of them and tells them that they'll make a new flute in order to counter McCreep's flute. The smurfs head into the forest and chop down a huge tree to get wood from the tree trunk's very centre as only this kind of wood can be useful in crafting a magical flute. Afterwards they celebrate with a party. However, just as Papa Smurf is about to give the flute to Johan and Peewit, the two are warped back to the wizard's house. Homnibus tries the spell again but passes out from a headache. Meanwhile, McCreep, who has now stolen over 7,000 gold pieces, arrives at the castle of his secret partner, Earl Flatbroke.

JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community.  - Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225  7 March 1274), was an Italian Dominican friar, Catholic priest, and Doctor of the Church. He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \\"Aquinas\\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio.  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders.  - Adam Pulchrae Mulieris , also called Adam de Puteorumvilla , was a Paris master who studied under Peter of Lamballe , who flourished in the first half of the 13th century . Little is known of his life . He has been described as one of the \`\` metaphysicians of light '' ( Robert Grosseteste was another ) . He was a contemporary of William of Auvergne , Bishop of Paris , and his works are cited by Richard de Fournival , Gerard of Abbeville and Thomas Aquinas . The origin of his name is unknown . The only book seriously attributed to him is Memoriale Rerum Difficilium , also known as De Intelligentiis . This was originally attributed to Witelo . It was published as Adam 's in 1908 but in the 1930s the question of this attribution was re-opened .  - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.  - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, were developed.  - Robert Grosseteste (   9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \\"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\\".  - Mendicant orders refers primarily to certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached.  - Gerard of Abbeville (1220-1272) was a theologian from the University of Paris. He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the mendicant orders, particularly in the second stage of the conflict, taking part in a concerted attack that temporarily affected their privileges.  - The Bishop of Lincoln is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln in the Province of Canterbury.  - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon.  - Doctor of the Church (Latin \\"doctor\\" \\"teacher\\") is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine.  - Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201  ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouvère perhaps best known for the \\"Bestiaire d'amour\\" (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\").  - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading.  - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.

Passage: As the 1990s dawned, gamers predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such as the 16-bit Sega Mega Drive/Genesis would mean the immediate end of the NES’s dominance. Instead, during the first year of Nintendo's successor console the Super Famicom (named Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan), the Famicom remained the second highest-selling video game console in Japan, outselling the newer and more powerful NEC PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by a wide margin. The console remained popular in Japan and North America until late 1993, when the demand for new NES software abruptly plummeted. The final Famicom game released in Japan is Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima IV (Adventure Island IV), while in North America, Wario's Woods is the final licensed game. In the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new software titles, Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES by 1995. However, Nintendo kept producing new Famicom units in Japan until September 25, 2003, and continued to repair Famicom consoles until October 31, 2007, attributing the discontinuation of support to insufficient supplies of parts.

Research shows that children who have no friends can suffer from difficulties later in life. Friendship provides children with more than just fun. In making friends, children learn how to get in touch with the others and solve problems. Having friends even does good to children's study for they can help each other during the class. If the parents care about their children whether they made many friends,what matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends. Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\\" For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones. Encourage children to show thanks to the others. The parents can encourage children to do this by setting the example for them.

With no family to turn to, she debates her future, wanting to break free from her controlling husband. She crosses paths with Wally and Mildred, an eccentric yet empathetic couple who can understand her struggles. The trio embarks on a rollercoaster journey of emotion, conspiracy, and self-discovery to help Veda escape her marriage and regain control of her life. Act 1: Veda Wharton, a talented artist, marries Jacob Carter, a wealthy and possessive businessman. Her dreams are shattered when she realizes how emotionally abusive and manipulative her husband is. Desperate for support and a way out, Veda's path crosses with Wally and Mildred, an older couple who own a quaint antique store in town. Wally, a retired detective, and Mildred, a wise and warm-hearted woman, recognize Veda's suffering and agree to help her escape her marriage. Act 2:  Wally and Mildred devise a detailed plan to help Veda collect evidence of Jacob's abusive behavior, ensuring she receives legal protection and a fair divorce settlement. Veda begins discretely documenting the abuse with photographs, voice recordings, and written accounts of her day-to-day experiences. Meanwhile, Wally uses his connections to find others who have been wronged by Jacob and wishes to testify against him.  As the trio works together, Veda forges a life-changing bond with Wally and Mildred. They impart wisdom, open her eyes to her true worth, and become the parental figures Veda never had. Veda's artistic talent flourishes in their presence, and she uses her art to express her emotions and cope with her fear. Act 3:  Mildred suggests that they inform the authorities and let the legal system handle the situation. Wally hesitates, fearing something might go wrong, but ultimately agrees that it is the safest route. Unexpectedly, Jacob discovers Veda's stash of evidence and confronts her with the intention of punishing her. However, in this climactic scene, Veda's newfound strength and the support of Wally and Mildred finally enable her to stand up to Jacob. Filled with courage, Veda calls the police and have her husband arrested. Her myriad of evidence reveals not only the abuse she suffered but also a series of financial crimes committed by her husband. Epilogue: After a lengthy, intense trial, Jacob is both convicted for his financial crimes and forced to comply with Veda's conditions for a divorce. Veda has successfully escaped her marriage and regained control of her life. The friendship and bond formed with Wally and Mildred grow even stronger. In the end, Veda, no longer suppressed under the weight of her abusive marriage, stands tall with Wally and Mildred by her side. The film closes as she opens her own art gallery and begins a new, fulfilling chapter of her life, unafraid and unhindered by her past. The Agreement is a poignant tale of perseverance, the power of friendship, and the courage of a woman discovering her inner worth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jack Hayes of Nation's Restaurant News calls the Sci-Fi Dine-In \\"wacky\\" and \\"on the cutting edge of sheer dining fun\\". In USA Today's list of the sixteen best restaurants in American amusement parks, the Sci-Fi Dine-In ranks fifteenth. Samuel Muston of The Independent writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In is \\"memorable in the best way\\". In the Evansville Courier & Press, Pete DiPrimio writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In ranks among the most unusual of the restaurants at Disney's Hollywood Studios. In The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2015, Bob Sehlinger and Len Testa call the Sci-Fi Dine-In the most entertaining restaurant in Walt Disney World, writing that \\"everyone gets a kick out of this unusual dining room\\".Multiple reviewers have called the Sci-Fi Dine-In more notable for being an attraction than a food destination. One reviewer from The Guardian compares the Sci-Fi Dine-In to Epcot's Coral Reef Restaurant, writing that both restaurants \\"are great settings\\" where \\"eating is awful\\". Sehlinger and Testa consider the prices too high, and the food too simple, although they praise the Reuben sandwich and the ribs. Schultz writes that the food is simple and that some of the beers are decent. The book DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Walt Disney World Resort & Orlando also states that the food is more expensive than it is worth. Ed Bumgardner of the Winston-Salem Journal shared this opinion as well, specifically singling out the restaurant's roast beef sandwich as a ripoff, despite calling it delicious. Peggy Katalinich of the Tampa Bay Times writes that, although the food is mediocre, \\"Who cares? Food is besides the point\\". She goes on to argue that the prices are low, particularly for sandwiches.

Our shop was on the fourth story of the building, so we had to install an elevator. The story of exposure to lead.","output":"No, the word \\"story\\" has two distinct meanings in each of these sentences. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Our shop was on the fourth story of the building, so we had to install an elevator,\\" the word \\"story\\" refers to a level or floor in a building. In this context, a \\"story\\" is a horizontal division of a building, consisting of a single floor that runs the entire length and width of the structure. Here, \\"story\\" denotes the vertical position of a distinct area within a building. The sentence basically means that the shop was located on the fourth floor, so an elevator had to be installed to provide easy access to this floor. 2. In the second sentence, \\"The story of exposure to lead,\\" the word \\"story\\" signifies a narrative or an account of events – a tale of occurrences. Here, \\"story\\" is used to describe the history, background, or sequence of events that are connected to the exposure of people, animals, or objects to the harmful effects of lead. This could be a detailed account of an incident caused by lead exposure, or it could be the summary of a series of experiences and facts related to how individuals or communities were affected by such exposure. In summary, the word \\"story\\" is not used in the same way in the two sentences provided. In the first sentence, it denotes the position of a specific floor in a building, while in the second sentence, it represents a narrative or account of events connected to a certain subject. Although \\"story\\" is spelled and pronounced the same way in both contexts, it carries different meanings and serves different purposes in each sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: Surprisingly, Reich didn't have to fabricate the episode to achieve that dramatic effect. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The truth value of the second sentence depends on the context and the interpretation of the content. Let's analyze both sentences in-depth to develop a better understanding. Sentence 1 claims that Reich \\"fabricated much of this episode for dramatic effect.\\" In other words, it suggests that Reich altered or exaggerated the details of the story for the sake of making it more interesting or engaging. Sentence 2, on the other hand, asserts that \\"Reich didn't have to fabricate the episode to achieve that dramatic effect.\\" This statement implies that the inherent drama of the episode was sufficient without the need for any narrative embellishment or distortion. If the first sentence is true, the conclusions we can draw are: 1. Reich did, in fact, fabricate much of the episode. 2. The primary motivation for doing so was to create a dramatic effect. Now, let's consider the implications of these conclusions in the context of the second sentence. 1. The fact that \\"Reich didn't have to fabricate the episode\\" contradicts the idea that Reich fabricated much of the episode. While the objective fact of whether or not Reich fabricated the episode may be clear, the necessity or lack thereof for doing so remains subjective.  2. From the perspective of necessity, if the first sentence is true, then one might argue that the second sentence is false. This would be based on the assumption that Reich's fabrications were, in fact, required for achieving the intended dramatic effect. However, it's essential to acknowledge that there may be more nuance to the matter. For example, it's possible that both sentences could be seen as true if we consider the idea that Reich might have fabricated the episode unnecessarily—that is, the original events were already dramatic enough but Reich still chose to exaggerate or alter them. Ultimately, in the absence of additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the truth value of the second sentence with certainty. We can only conclude that if the first sentence is true, the relationship between the two sentences warrants further examination and depends on the subjective interpretation of the facts and intentions behind the fabrication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the key elements of the sentence:    - \\"watts\\" refers to an actress (or character) in the movie.    - \\"lend credibility\\" implies that her role adds authenticity to the movie.    - \\"strange scenario\\" suggests an unusual or unexpected plot.    - \\"her presence succeeds\\" indicates that Watts effectively contributes to the movie.    - \\"making us believe\\" denotes that the audience is convinced by the story and performance. 2.

Weigh the sentiment of each key element to determine the overall sentiment of the sentence:    - The mildly negative sentiment of \\"strange scenario\\" is offset by the overall positive sentiment expressed towards Watts and the effectiveness of her role in the movie. 4.

The passage portrays a scene where a filly is resting in the straw, with thin legs folded beneath her, while the mare is occupied with consuming the extra oats provided by the Kentuckian. In this particular context, the mare exhibits an interest in the supplementary feed and proceeds to consume the oats. The passage does not suggest any hesitation or reluctance on the mare's part to eat the extra feed. Instead, it demonstrates satisfaction on the mare's behalf, as she can be observed munching on the oats. In contrast, the statement \\"The mare looked at his feed but did not eat.\\" conveys a different set of circumstances than the passage provided. This statement implies that the mare showed a lack of interest or appetite in regard to the feed, despite its presence. Such a response could be attributed to various factors, ranging from the mare's health, preferences, or even distractions resulting from her environment. In conclusion, the given statement does not align with the established information from the passage.

(CNN) -- As we learned in past battles with polio and AIDS, the key to solving a massive health crisis is to move public sentiment away from fear and stigmatization toward action and acceptance. That is why a recent ad campaign about Ebola from Medicins Du Monde -- MDM or Doctors of the World -- is so encouraging An international humanitarian and medical organization with a long history of advocating for vulnerable populations, MDM joined in the United States with ad agency Publicis Kaplan Thaler to turn public fear of Ebola on its head by asking people to donate a hazmat suit to workers in Africa. The symbol of the fearful hazmat suit is reintroduced as a crucial piece of the solution: \\"Here it's a costume. There it saves lives.\\" It is possible we can chart a better course in the future on","output":"global health crises by learning from our experiences with polio, AIDS, and Ebola, and by leveraging the power of public sentiment for positive change. The success of MDM's ad campaign highlights the importance of reframing the narrative around such crises, transforming fearful symbols into powerful tools of action and solidarity. One potential strategy to achieve this involves collaborating with local and international organizations, like MDM, to create targeted and effective public awareness campaigns. These campaigns should be tailored to resonate with diverse communities and cultures, ensuring that they address specific fears and misconceptions while emphasizing the need for collective action. Moreover, investing in research and development of innovative medical solutions, such as vaccines and therapeutics, should remain a priority. This could combat the spread of infectious diseases and provide long-term support for affected regions. It is crucial, however, to also address societal and infrastructural vulnerabilities that contribute to the persistence of these health crises. Another key aspect in charting a better course is improving communication and coordination among different stakeholders, such as governments, NGOs, and healthcare providers. Building trust through transparent information sharing and collaboration would foster a sense of collective responsibility, rather than stigmatization, towards affected communities. Lastly, education and capacity building initiatives should be implemented to ensure that both individuals and communities are better equipped to handle and prevent future health crises. This includes promoting better hygiene practices, personal protective measures, and empowering community members to become local health advocates. By adopting these steps, we can not only alleviate the suffering caused by current health crises, but also better prepare for and prevent the emergence of future ones. The collective action and acceptance demonstrated during our previous fights against polio, AIDS, and Ebola serve as a powerful reminder that we can overcome even the most daunting challenges when we stand together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Neptune has 14 known moons. Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[e] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System, with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C). Now answer this question: What orbit does Triton have around Neptune?","output":"Triton has a special kind of orbit around Neptune called \\"retrograde orbit\\".

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: World Car Free Day is a very important day on the environmental calendar. Every September 22, governments, green groups and ordinary citizens stress the damage cars are doing to the earth. The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars. Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car-controlled society.     Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, \\"World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. \\"     Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s. An international car-free day was organized in Europe in 1999. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day.     World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars.

One of the most important questions is if you have enough space. You may need to add onto your kitchen. After settling on space, pick out the kitchen features you absolutely have to have.  For example, your dream kitchen may feature an island cooktop instead of a traditional stove. Save pictures of kitchens you like. Use them to identify features you want in your ideal kitchen. Decide upon a maximum amount of money you’re willing to invest in the remodel. As you plan your kitchen, do some research to find out how your plans fit your budget. You can do this by searching for furniture estimates online, visiting furniture showrooms, and talking to designers and contractors.  Most of the time, remodeling costs more than you’d expect, so you’ll need to alter your plans or budget. The biggest priority is getting the layout and utilities right. Cabinets and countertops are the next part. These will comprise most of your biggest expenses. Don’t forget to add in designer and contractor costs. Take the time to draw out your kitchen. Figure out where you’ll put your refrigerator and other appliances. Add in the counters and cabinets. A complete sketch shows you how much space you have to work with. You may need to opt for smaller appliances, counters, and cabinets in order to maintain enough free space in the kitchen. Keep in mind where your utility lines are going to be. Electrical outlets, plumbing, and gas lines all affect the arrangement. To save money, have the contractor keep them where they are now. Most likely you have an idea of how you want the kitchen to look. Perhaps you want your kitchen to look modern instead of traditional. It could be all wood, or it could incorporate a color theme. Picking a style means focusing on the overall look of the kitchen rather than its parts.  For example, a kitchen with a modern style might have a black, gray, or white color scheme with a lot of reflective surfaces and marble walls. The appliances can be metallic and the furniture can look very sleek and minimal. A cottage kitchen could have checkered light blue or yellow patterns, vintage or white appliances, wood floors, and colorful decorations. For a farmhouse kitchen, wood flooring and furniture works well. The color scheme can include red, yellow, blue or white. Stone and brick appliances can also give a rustic look. A French or Mediterranean kitchen looks very ornate. It can feature warm colors with white or yellow walls and wood cabinets. It might have hand-painted wall tiles, a chandelier, copper pots, or ceramic crafts on display. Even if you plan on building the kitchen yourself, speaking to a designer is a good idea. Kitchen designers and architects can help you finalize your remodeling plans while staying within your budget. Construction contractors provide outlines for structural and utility work. You’ll need these plans to apply for building permits. Significant remodels involve a lot of different parts, from electrical wiring to furniture installation. Usually you can get one contractor to do everything you need. Get estimates from at least three companies. Each contractor should talk to you about your design plans and give you an estimate.  Use the estimate to figure out if you need to change your plans to stay under budget. Search the contractor’s name online to find reviews from other customers. Consult your local government to figure out what permits you need. For most work, you won’t need a permit. If your remodeling plan includes building or demolishing walls, window openings, or utility lines, you’ll most likely need a permit. Designers, architects, and contractors can take care of this.

Write an article based on this \\"Four British swimmers have won their appeal to ratify two world records set at the European Championships in 2014.\\"","output":"Title: Success in the Water - British Swimmers Triumph in 2014 European Championships World Record Appeal Introduction: In a thrilling announcement for British swimming fans, four British swimmers who set two world records at the 2014 European Championships have emerged victorious in their appeal. The swimmers, Adam Peaty, Francesca Halsall, Christopher Walker-Hebborn, and Jemma Lowe, made history in the Berlin competition, only to have their celebrated success contested. After a long fight for recognition, justice has now been served, and the athletes' exceptional achievements can finally be celebrated anew. Background: The 2014 European Swimming Championships, held in Berlin, witnessed strong performances from these British swimmers. In the competition, they set two world records - one for the 4x100m mixed medley relay (3:44.02) and the other for the 4x50m mixed medley relay (1:37.46). It was an incredible feat for Adam Peaty, Francesca Halsall, Christopher Walker-Hebborn, and Jemma Lowe as they proudly represented Great Britain at the prestigious event. Ruling: The records achieved by this indomitable group of swimmers were initially deemed ineligible due to a technicality. Amid a series of concerns surrounding the eligibility criteria, the swimmers’ appeal gained traction and eventually prevailed. The crux of the matter stemmed from the absence of mandatory independent drug-testing requirements for world-record ratification at the European Championships in 2014. As a result, the initial ruling led to the invalidation of British swimmers' world records. The athletes responded by launching an appeal, arguing that the circumstances surrounding eligibility were beyond their control. They further emphasized that they had always been committed to clean sport and that their achievements should not be tarnished by an administrative issue. The successful appeal indicates the clear determination of these swimmers to defend the integrity of their performances. This landmark decision suggests a shift in how sporting organizations may need to approach eligibility issues and criteria in the future. Recognizing the swimmers' outstanding feats reflects a greater commitment to rewarding hard work and dedication, thus boosting morale within the swimming community. Impact on British Swimming: The favourable decision will inevitably have a significant and positive impact on British swimming in general. It reinforces the prowess and remarkable talent of British swimmers on the international stage. The successful appeal sends a strong message to budding British athletes that their achievements will not go unnoticed, solidifying the notion that commitment to hard work, discipline, and exceptional performance pays off in the long run. Moreover, the verdict serves as a reminder that even the highest echelons of world sport can be vulnerable to administrative issues. It also underscores the importance of having robust systems in place to ensure that drug testing requirements are met, thereby upholding the integrity and fairness in competitive sports. Conclusion: The ruling in favour of the four British swimmers bears testament to the unwavering resilience and determination required in elite sport. Their success in the appeal has secured their rightful place in the annals of swimming history, allowing their incredible achievements at the 2014 European Championships to shine. As the swimming community around the world revels in their triumph, the talented quartet is undoubtedly an inspiration to countless aspiring athletes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the alcoholic beverage similar to cider which is made from fermented pears?","output":"The alcoholic beverage similar to cider that is made from fermented pears is known as perry. Perry, sometimes also referred to as pear cider, has been common in England for centuries, particularly in the Three Counties (Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire) and the Welsh Marches. Like its apple-based counterpart, perry is made through the fermentation of pear juice, the quality and flavor profile of which can be significantly affected by factors including the variety of pears used, the quality of the harvest, and even regional characteristics of the area in which the pears were grown - a concept similar to the \\"terroir\\" seen in wine-making. The process of brewing perry begins with the collection of pears, which are harvested during fall. The harvested pears are left to mature and sweeten for several days or even few weeks. The matured pears are then crushed and pressed to extract their juice. This juice, known as must, is left to ferment over the course of several weeks or months, using naturally occurring yeasts or those added by the brewer. Throughout this fermentation period, the sugars in the pear juice are converted into alcohol by the yeast. Once the fermentation process is complete, the perry is often filtered to remove remaining sediment, then it is left to mature – a period that can last from several months to several years depending on the brewer's preference. The resulting beverage is generally clearer and lighter in body than traditional apple cider, with a flavor that can range from very sweet to dry, with a fresh, fruity pear flavor. Many factors can influence the taste of the final perry product, including the type of pear used. Until recently, perry was traditionally made with specific varieties of pears known as perry pears, which are different from standard table pears. There are many different varieties of perry pears, each imparting their own unique flavor and aroma characteristics to the finished product. Some of these include the Thorn pear, known for its high tannin content that contributes body and the Moorcroft pear, which imparts a sweet flavor. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of perry production, driven by an increase in popularity of craft and artisanal brewing and distillery operations. Today, you can find a wide range of perry products on the market, from mass-produced versions that mimic the light, refreshing qualities of popular ciders, to small-batch artisanal offerings that highlight the nuanced complexities of specific perry pear varieties. Despite these variations, at its core, perry remains a delightful and often under-appreciated cousin of cider, offering its own unique twist on fermented fruit beverages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, we can deduce that researchers with expertise in those disciplines have critically evaluated the case study method from different viewpoints. They may have examined the design, implementation, data collection, analysis, and ethical considerations related to case studies. However, based on this premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Researchers in entirely unrelated fields were the ones that critically discussed the case study from all angles\\" holds true or false. The premise does not indicate any information about researchers from entirely unrelated fields or whether they played any role in discussing the case study method. It is not uncommon for researchers in unrelated fields to use case study methodology, as case studies are a versatile research tool and can offer valuable insights into various phenomena across disciplines. These researchers may have also contributed to the discourse around case studies, bringing unique perspectives from their respective fields. Here are a few possible scenarios from which to consider the hypothesis: 1. Unrelated fields' researchers could have critically discussed case studies from all angles, in addition to the researchers within specified disciplines. In this scenario, both groups would have contributed to the development and understanding of the case study. 2. Researchers in unrelated fields may have discussed case studies from some angles, but not necessarily from all angles. They may have evaluated specific aspects or offered unique perspectives that may not be covered within the disciplines involved. 3. Researchers from unrelated fields may have had minimal or no involvement in critically discussing case studies from all angles. In this case, the essential discussions would mostly come from researchers within the specified disciplines.

As she dipped her fountain pen into the inkwell, she recalled all the moments she experienced under Emily's mentorship. Rachel wanted to ensure that her gratitude was not merely expressed through words but also evoked the emotions that accompanied the fulfillment of working closely with someone who appreciates thoughtfulness. Greeting Emily with a heartfelt 'Dear Emily,' she continued her letter by acknowledging the first time they had met. Rachel recalled the interview process and how Emily's insightful questions had piqued her interest in the position. She mentioned how Emily had carefully observed her potential and given her an opportunity that eventually led to her professional growth. Rachel proceeded to elaborate on the ways Emily had consciously promoted an environment of thoughtfulness in the workplace. Be it through weekly check-ins, providing constructive feedback, or being a listening ear to her concerns, Emily's influence had shaped the way Rachel perceived her role and her interactions with her peers. As she dived deeper into the letter, Rachel mentioned specific instances where Emily had not only showcased thoughtfulness but also preferred others who shared the same value. Emily's support of employees who took time to plan and consider alternatives before arriving at an informed decision was one such example. Additionally, Rachel highlighted Emily's encouragement of team members who often engaged in thoughtful gestures, like handwritten thank-you notes or remembering colleagues' birthdays. Rachel then took a moment to express how Emily's preference for thoughtful people had created a positive, collaborative work culture. Employees were continually motivated to perform at their best, reciprocating the same thoughtfulness that had been demonstrated by their leader. The team, as Rachel described, had blossomed into an active community that thrived on empathy and understanding, all fostered by Emily's penchant for thoughtfulness. As she approached the conclusion of her letter, Rachel extended her appreciation for all that Emily had done for her, both professionally and personally. She shared how her own viewpoint had changed since working with Emily and that thoughtfulness had become integral to her life outside the workplace as well. With a final line expressing her sincerest gratitude for being a part an environment that celebrates thoughtfulness, Rachel signed the letter and let the ink dry. Once complete, she carefully folded the letter and placed it within a tasteful envelope, addressing it to Emily with a sense of pride. Rachel hoped the letter would serve as a lasting testament to Emily's impact on her life and the lives of countless others who had the fortune to work under her guidance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How can I undo a spelling mistake I did with pencil by hand? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of undoing a spelling mistake you did with a pencil by hand, the most reasonable and efficient method is using an eraser. Follow these steps and justify each of them: 1. Locate the spelling mistake: Identify the specific part of the text where you made the spelling error to target only that portion of your writing. 2. Choose a suitable eraser: Opt for a clean and smudge-free eraser that is designed for pencil erasing. A good-quality eraser will result in a cleaner result, without damaging the paper. 3. Position the eraser: Hold the eraser gently against the part of the mistake you want to undo, ensuring you are not pressing too hard on the paper. It is important to maintain a balanced pressure to avoid tearing the paper. 4. Rub the eraser gently: Move the eraser carefully back and forth on the pencil marks you want to remove. The lateral motion of the eraser will help lift the graphite particles from the paper’s surface. 5. Check the results: Once the spelling mistake is no longer visible, stop erasing to prevent any unnecessary wear to the paper. 6. Clean the eraser debris: Brush off any eraser particles from the paper using your hand or a soft brush to keep your work area clean for re-writing the correct text. 7. Correct the mistake: Re-write the corrected spelling on the paper, ensuring that your writing is clear and free from errors. Using an eraser is a more practical method as compared to other alternatives like using correction fluid, which is designed for pen mistakes and not suitable for pencil marks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: I don't like talking openly about my feelings. That's probably why I am writing this, because it seems an easier way of telling you how thankful I am to you. When I first got ill two years ago and had to be taken to hospital, you were the first person I called to tell, maybe because I knew Mum wasn't going to answer her phone, but probably because you are the first person I call in an emergency. As one illness turned into another and I was stuck in hospital for weeks, feeling sorry for myself, you were still at my beside trying to talk to me to cheer me up. The illness hit my kidney  and we then realized that I was going to need a transport sooner or later. You put yourself forward to be tested as soon as possible and it turned out you were a perfect match. Then last year, in March, we both went down for the operation. I woke a few hours afterwards and felt better. It wasn't until the following day that we got to see each other again. We hugged silently and asked one another how we were. But I never said the words I should have--- thank you. To this day, I still haven't said those words to you for my kidney. In the month after the operation, when we were both at home recovering, I made you lunch, went for walks with you. It's my way of saying that I care for you a great deal and that I am truly thankful for what you did for me. I want you to know that my silence towards you and the times you tried to talk to me and got nothing weren't because of you. Maybe one day when you will read this, I hope you know that in my own silent way, I am for ever thankful.

Question: Sonar equipment sends waves into deep water and measures the Answer:","output":"Sonar equipment sends waves into deep water and measures the time it takes for the echoes to return after bouncing off objects or the seafloor. Step 1: Send out sound waves The sonar device sends out sound waves (often called \\"pings\\") into the water. These waves travel through the water until they encounter an object or the seafloor. Step 2: Listen for the echo After the sound wave encounters an object or the seafloor, it bounces back towards the sonar equipment. The equipment listens for these echoes or reflections of the original sound waves. Step 3: Measure the time taken for the echo to return The sonar equipment precisely measures the time it takes for the echo to return from the point it was sent to the point it was received. This is known as the \\"two-way travel time.\\" Step 4: Calculate distance Using the measured two-way travel time and the speed of sound in water (approximately 1,500 meters per second), the distance from the sonar equipment to the object or seafloor can be calculated using the equation: Distance = (Speed of Sound × Time) / 2 Step 5: Create a representation of the underwater environment The data collected from these distance calculations can then be used to create a representation of the underwater environment, such as a depth map or a sonar image, which can be useful for various applications like navigation, scientific research, or detecting underwater objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The wearer can then tighten or loosen the cord to fit their head comfortably, ensuring a secure fit. This option is commonly used for sports glasses or other high-activity situations to prevent glasses from falling off. Option [II] (securing eye glasses with buttons) is incorrect because buttons are not typically used to secure glasses on a person's head. Instead, glasses are designed to fit snugly on the bridge of the nose and wrap around the ears with their temples. Buttons would not provide a comfortable, secure fit and are not a practical solution for fastening or holding glasses in place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent!!! Yay!!! This programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'Brand f*cking Beckham'. A few years ago I used to really like 'Posh and Becks', I still very much admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet. It was clear the hand of Victoria was all over Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened at Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he's sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from Division One in England (no offence America - but at Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you don't!)  Anyway - I digress. It's been years since I've seen such an over-the-top, entirely false performance from 'Posh' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the Rebecca Loos 'debacle', when instead of throwing all the cr*p at David he deserved, she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money-spinner her marriage has become. This whole PR stunt was pathetic. Why can't she just go over there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to America should be shrouded by this huge fan fare?  Incidentally, I saw the David Beckham documentary last night. At least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning. One more thing Victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps. Little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman. Good Luck America!!","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses strong disapproval and resentment towards Victoria Beckham and her influence on her husband, David Beckham. There is a sense of frustration and disdain towards the couple's constant presence in the media, their self-promotion, and the perceived manipulation of their careers and personal lives for fame and financial gain. The reviewer also criticizes Victoria Beckham's lack of humility and questions her motives, implying that she is self-absorbed and calculating in controlling both her own and her husband's public image. They express relief that she will be far away from them due to relocating to another continent. However, there is a slight positive note regarding David Beckham within this review, as the writer still admires his talent and mentions that he has maintained some grace and humility in comparison to his wife. Despite this, the overall sentiment remains heavily negative due to the scathing criticism directed at Victoria Beckham and the impact she has on her family and public image."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: How many times does the hands of the clock overlap in a day? Second question: How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a 24 hour period? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let's break down the two questions and analyze them: 1. How many times does the hands of the clock overlap in a day? 2. How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a 24 hour period? Step 1: Identify the similarities and differences Both questions are asking about the overlapping of hour and minute hands on a clock. The first question refers to \\"a day,\\" while the second question specifies a \\"24 hour period.\\" Step 2: Determine if \\"a day\\" and \\"24 hour period\\" are equivalent A day is typically understood to be a 24 hour period. Therefore, the time frames being referred to in both questions are the same. Step 3: Analyze if the questions are asking for the same information Both questions are asking for the number of times the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap. Thus, they are asking for the same information. Conclusion: Yes, these two questions are asking the same thing. Now let's answer the question: How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a 24 hour period? Step 1: Analyze the clock A regular clock has 12 hours, and the hour and minute hands overlap once every hour, except for one instance where the 12-hour cycle resets. Step 2: Calculate the overlaps in a 12-hour cycle Since there are 12 hours on a clock, the hands overlap 11 times during a 12-hour cycle (missing the instance where the cycle resets). Step 3: Calculate the overlaps in a 24-hour cycle Since there are two 12-hour cycles in a 24-hour period, the total overlaps will be 2 * 11 = 22. Answer: The hour and minute hands of a clock overlap 22 times in a 24 hour period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:A state law passed in March requires transgender people to use toilets that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. The ruling led to boycotts of the state by some sports teams, businesses, and entertainers. The full case challenging the bill is expected to go to trial in November. US District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder said three plaintiffs challenging the measure had a strong chance of proving that the state's toilet-access measure violated federal law, and temporarily blocked the university from applying the state law. \\"The individual transgender plaintiffs have clearly shown that they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,\\" he wrote, noting their assertions that single-occupant toilets were generally unavailable at the University of North Carolina. 'We just need to pee' transgender protest Why toilets are a battleground for transgender rights One of the three people who challenged the law is University of North California student Joaquin Carcano. \\"Today, the tightness that I have felt in my chest every day.... has eased. But the fight is not over: we won't rest until this discriminatory law is defeated,'' Mr Carcano said. Legislators in North Carolina enacted the law after the town of Charlotte passed a bill allowing transgender people to use toilets according to gender identity. Lawmakers in several other US states have proposed similar legislation - sometimes referred to as \\"bathroom bills\\". Some people have said that allowing transgender people to choose their toilet could lead to women and children being attacked. They said they feared that predatory men could pose as transgender people and use legal protections as a cover.

The game of Sudoku involves filling in squares with what numbers????","output":"The game of Sudoku involves filling in squares with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to complete the grid such that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetitions. Here's a step-by-step process for solving a Sudoku puzzle: Step 1: Observe the given numbers Look at the pre-filled numbers in the grid and try to find rows, columns, or subgrids with a high concentration of given numbers. This will make it easier to determine missing numbers. Step 2: Fill in the obvious numbers Identify the cells where only one possible number can fit due to the constraints of the game. Fill in these numbers as they will help you to find more possibilities in other cells. Step 3: Use the process of elimination For cells with multiple possible numbers, eliminate the numbers that already appear in the same row, column, or subgrid. This might help you identify the correct number for that cell. Step 4: Look for patterns In some cases, the same set of numbers appears in multiple rows, columns, or subgrids. Focus on these patterns to see if they can help you determine the missing numbers. Step 5: Use advanced techniques if necessary If the above steps aren't enough to solve the puzzle, you may need to use advanced techniques such as X-Wing, Swordfish, or forcing chains. These involve finding more complex patterns and relationships between the numbers on the grid. Step 6: Double-check your work Once you have filled in all the cells, go through the completed grid to ensure that each row, column, and subgrid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetitions. By following these steps and thinking logically, you should be able to complete a Sudoku puzzle.

What happens when oil is placed in water? Options: +Some oil sinks below the surface. +Oil droplets form in the water. +The oil and water mix together. +The oil floats on top of the water.","output":"In order to determine what happens when oil is placed in water, I will analyze each option provided and assess the likelihood of each outcome based on the properties of oil and water. Option 1: Some oil sinks below the surface. - Oil is less dense than water, which generally means it will not sink below the water's surface. Thus, this option is unlikely. Option 2: Oil droplets form in the water. - While oil droplets can form if vigorously mixed with water (e.g., through the process of emulsification), oil and water do not naturally mix due to their differing polarities. Water is a polar molecule, whereas oil is non-polar. If the oil is simply placed in water without any external force, they will not naturally form droplets. Therefore, this option is also unlikely. Option 3: The oil and water mix together. - As mentioned earlier, oil and water do not naturally mix due to their differing polarities. Without external forces, such as emulsification, they will not blend together. Consequently, this option is improbable. Option 4: The oil floats on top of the water. - This option is the most likely outcome. When oil is placed in water, it will float on the surface due to its lower density in comparison to water. The difference in density, along with the differing polarities of the two substances, prevents the oil from mixing with the water, causing it to form a layer on the water's surface.

Summarize: The data for 2012 shows a marked rise on the 12.7 million cases in 2008. In that time the number of deaths has also increased, from 7.6 million to 8.2 million. The rising burden of cancer is being driven by a rapid shift in lifestyles in the developing world to more closely reflect industrialised countries. Rising rates of smoking and obesity as well as people living longer are contributing to the rise. Lung cancer, which is mainly caused by smoking, was the most common cancer globally, with 1.8 million cases - about 13% of the total. The WHO also described a \\"sharp rise\\" in cases of breast cancer. Both the incidence and mortality have increased since 2008. The disease in now the most common cancer in women in 140 countries. Dr David Forman, from the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, said: \\"Breast cancer is also a leading cause of cancer death in the less developed countries of the world. \\"This is partly because a shift in lifestyles is causing an increase in incidence, and partly because clinical advances to combat the disease are not reaching women living in these regions.\\" The WHO said there was an \\"urgent need\\" for the advances made in detection, diagnoses and treatment of breast cancer to be implemented in developing nations.

The most common cancer is lung cancer, which is mostly because of smoking. There are also many more cases of breast cancer, especially in women. Doctors say we need to help people in these countries learn how to find and treat breast cancer better.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Your brain takes around 20 minutes to register feelings of fullness, suggesting that you need to slow down so that your brain can properly communicate those feelings. If you don't feel full immediately after a meal, wait. The chemicals your brain releases when you eat or drink take time to rise and to communicate that sense of fullness. As the chemicals increase, your hunger dissipates; this is why you should pause for a little bit after eating and before having a second helping. Eating with your hands will mean that you take in more food in one scoop. Studies also show that people who eat with larger utensils eat less than those who eat with smaller utensils. When you feel comfortably satiated after eating, stop and put your utensils and napkin on the plate to signal that you're finished. This is also a signal to yourself that you're done with your meal as well as to those around you. Remember, you don't have to eat all of your meal once you feel satisfied. Eat until you are 80% full. No one should feel stuffed and sick after eating. Often we mistake thirst for hunger which means we eat when it's not necessary. By keeping yourself well hydrated you'll feel hungry less as well as getting a clearer complexion and shinier hair. If you're not sure what you're feeling is actually hunger, try drinking a big glass of water and then wait a few minutes. If you don't feel hungry anymore, it's because your body was actually in need of water, not food. . This is a simple yet very powerful exercise to open your eyes to see whether you are keeping up with your food plan. Often, we tend to overlook the snacking we do between meals and instead really think that our diet is failing us. Most people underestimate their daily intake by about 25 percent.  You might also discover useful information about your daily habits and a reality check about how many calories you actually consume. Once you know your habits and patterns better, you can begin to address problem behaviors that are hindering your progress. Keeping a journal also makes you more accountable. Eating in restaurants or at other people's homes can be a real challenge. You want to eat, but you also don't want to eat the wrong things and risk backtracking on your progress.  Choose foods that are steamed, grilled, broiled or baked instead of fried. Avoid dishes that are labeled as \\"breaded\\", \\"crispy\\" or \\"battered\\" – these are code words for \\"fried\\". Don't be afraid to ask for modifications. For example, ask to swap out potatoes or bread for a side salad. Request sauce on the side of chicken or other entrée, rather than smothered on top. This will enable you to still eat something delicious but without all of the extra calories.  If the restaurant is known for especially large portion sizes, opt to split something with a friend.  To avoid overeating when going out, eat a small and healthy snack at home beforehand. Try some carrots and hummus or an apple.This will curb off your hunger and keep your head clear while you make healthy and informed choices from the restaurant's offerings. Pack away food. At the beginning of the meal, ask for a doggie bag, and put what you aren't going to eat in the bag. When ordering salads, always ask for dressings and sauces on the side. Lots of dressings can be very fatty and full of calories. Your seemingly \\"healthy choice\\" can pack as many calories as a burger if it’s swimming in a fatty dressing. Be also wary of other high-calorie additions like bacon bits and cheese. You might overeat one night. You might have a bad day where you indulge in way too much junk food. Just don't despair when you realize you've strayed from your goals. It took you a lifetime to achieve your current weight, and it will take time to achieve your new weight and size goal. To keep up your optimism, reward yourself for meeting smaller goals. For example, buy yourself a small token or treat every time you lose another five times. The prospect of the reward will eventually become its own form of motivation.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Bank of Italy, the ultimate arbiter of Italian banking mergers, has been engulfed by scandal since police wire taps revealed Fazio and his wife advised a local banker in a bid for Bank Antonveneta against Dutch bank ABN AMRO. Hypothesis: A local banker bids for Bank Antonveneta.","output":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis stating \\"A local banker bids for Bank Antonveneta\\" is true. The paragraph discusses a scandal involving the Bank of Italy, which is an institution that plays a vital role in Italian banking mergers. The scandal arose from police wire taps that exposed Fazio, presumably a high-ranking official at the Bank of Italy, and his wife giving advice to a local banker. This advice was specifically regarding the local banker's bid for Bank Antonveneta and it hints at a potential conflict of interest, as Fazio and his wife should have maintained a neutral stance in this situation. Furthermore, the paragraph highlights that the local banker was attempting to acquire Bank Antonveneta, which was also targeted by the Dutch bank, ABN AMRO. This competition between the local banker and ABN AMRO suggests that there was indeed a bidding war for the ownership of Bank Antonveneta. In conclusion, the paragraph provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that a local banker was bidding for Bank Antonveneta. The scandal involving Fazio and his wife, as well as the competition with ABN AMRO, indicate that the local banker's bid for Bank Antonveneta was a significant factor in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of \\"Fido,\\" who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to \\"life\\" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series \\"Lassie\\" - it might easily have been entitled \\"A Boy and His Zombie\\" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse. This is what \\"Lassie\\" might have been had Timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies.","output":"The sentiment of the given review appears to be positive. The review highlights various aspects of the movie \\"Fido\\" that the reviewer finds appreciable. 1. The reviewer appreciates the unique concept of zombies being turned into butlers and servants in the 1950's setting. 2. They mention the slyly satirical swipes the movie takes at various concerns of the pre-'60s era, demonstrating the thoughtfulness behind the story. 3.

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: What does David Meyer do for a living? Options:  A. Something smart  B.

This is more than just foreign music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

Article: Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are now a part of everyday driving in many counties.These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two.              Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm, Sweden. The center studies human-computer interaction, or HCI, especially communications involving wireless devices. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes until they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in.

Help as much as you can. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues. Options: A there is a decrease in children's self-esteem B there are fewer children better at academics C children may have a strong desire to succeed D children may feel more optimistic about their future Answer: D children may feel more optimistic about their future Question: The answer to this question is:","output":"According to the article, having a positive role model can lead to what effect in children's outlook on their future?

Mendes was born in Niteroi, Brazil, the son of a physician. He attended the local conservatory with hopes of becoming a classical pianist.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse  of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution  -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules. Question: We know from the passage that   _ Options: A: Social fairness is very important for a society to survive \\" B: there must be a war to end an old society and build a new one C: only the poorest are willing to help the richest in a society D: the poor people in a society are always cheated by those wealthy ones A:","output":"Social fairness is very important for a society to survive In the article, it mentions that a society is concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics, and time limits which are basic ways to achieve fairness. It is also mentioned that if these fairness measures break down, people will see society as unfair, which could lead to its breakdown or failure.

Answer the following question: Q: What do scientists use to study the deep without going to the seafloor?   A: Answer:","output":"Scientists use a range of technological devices and methods in order to study the depths of the sea without physically going to the seafloor.  1. Sonar technology: Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) systems use the propagation of sound waves to detect and map objects in water. It can measure depth and create detailed topographical maps of the seafloor. 2. Satellite Remote Sensing: Scientists use satellites to measure sea surface height, which can provide clues about what lies beneath. Changes in sea surface height can indicate the presence of mountains, ridges, and other topographical features on the ocean floor.  3. ROVs and AUVs: Unmanned submarines, known as Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), can be controlled from a ship to take video, and photographs, gather physical samples, and collect data on temperature, salinity, and other qualities of seawater.  4. Seismic surveys: By setting off controlled explosions on a ship, and measuring how long the sound waves take to bounce back from the seabed, scientists can gather information about the rock types below the seafloor. 5. Deep-sea Sediment Cores: Scientists can study the core samples of the ocean floor, which are extracted by dropping a coring device to the seafloor. By examining these samples, they can understand the historical geology and biological activity in the ocean. 6. Submersibles: Though not without going to the seafloor, it's worth mentioning that scientists also use manned submersibles such as Alvin to directly observe the deep sea and collect samples. These tools and methodologies allow scientists to gather information about the underwater world, helping them to study and understand the largely unexplored deep-sea environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and index finger are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words \\"God's Revenge against Murder\\" written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness),  and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: Dear TommyMy mistress has been the best of women to me, and my conscience flies in my face as often as I think of wronging her; yet I am resolved to venture body and soul to do as you would have me, so do not fail to meet me as you said you would, for I will bring along with me all the things I can lay my hands on. So no more at present; but I remain yours till death. Ann Gill. The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic, Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical.

Below the print, the text claims that Nero, if not repentant, is at least stunned by his actions: Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the witching hour.

What does Inuit and Eskimo mean ? What kind of thing would answer this question?","output":"\\"Inuit\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" are terms used to describe different indigenous peoples who inhabit the Arctic regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. These terms have unique origins and implications, and their usage and acceptance can vary significantly. \\"Inuit\\" refers specifically to the indigenous peoples of Northern Alaska (Inupiat), Canada (Inuit), and Greenland (Kalaallit). The term is of native origin, and it means \\"the people\\" in the Inuit language, which is also known as Inuktitut. The Inuit people share a common linguistic and cultural heritage, and their language belongs to the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit communities throughout these regions have been historically engaged in hunting, fishing, and other subsistence activities, with traditional practices shaped by the challenges of their local environment. \\"Eskimo,\\" on the other hand, is a term with a more complex history. It was originally used by non-native people, and its etymology is uncertain. Some sources claim that it comes from a Native American language and means \\"eaters of raw meat,\\" while others argue that it derives from an Inuit word meaning \\"people wearing snowshoes.\\" Regardless of its origins, \\"Eskimo\\" was widely adopted by early European explorers and settlers to describe the Arctic indigenous peoples, including both the Inuit and the Yupik (found in Alaska and Siberia). Over time, the term \\"Eskimo\\" has become controversial in certain contexts. Some indigenous communities consider the word to be pejorative due to its uncertain origins and potential negative connotations. Additionally, it tends to homogenize a diverse group of Arctic peoples with distinct languages, cultures, and histories. As a result, \\"Inuit\\" has become the preferred term in Canada and Greenland, while \\"Eskimo\\" is still used in Alaska. However, Alaskan Native corporations and organizations have advocated for the usage of specific group names, such as Inupiat and Yupik, to be more culturally respectful. In summary, \\"Inuit\\" refers specifically to the indigenous peoples of Northern Alaska, Canada, and Greenland who share a common linguistic and cultural heritage, whereas \\"Eskimo\\" is a more general term that encompasses both the Inuit and Yupik peoples. The latter term has become controversial in certain contexts due to its uncertain origins and potential negative connotations, so it is now primarily used in Alaska but is falling out of favor in favor of more culturally respectful designations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A plan was quickly crafted at the international business to save their financials because the  pick from the following. (i) business was unorganized.; (ii) plan was unorganized.;","output":"(i) business was unorganized. There was an urgent need for change. The realization that the business was unorganized had reached the management, causing them to scramble for a solution. The once-thriving enterprise had started to slip through the cracks, as inefficient processes, spotty communication, and unplanned decisions wreaked havoc on their once-immaculate reputation. The board of directors convened an emergency meeting to bring forth a resolution to the crisis. The CEO, Annabelle Thompson, was at the helm of the meeting, presenting the alarming statistics and figures that highlighted the severity of the situation. The participants listened with rapt attention and growing concern as they began to absorb the gravity of the problem. After some moments of silence and contemplation, the board members and top executives started to map out a plan to save their financials and turn the business around. Divided into several specific categories, the plan aimed to address various issues, with clear-cut steps and well-defined timelines for each. First and foremost, the team decided to overhaul their communication channels. To solve the widespread miscommunication, they introduced new policies for meetings, emails, and discussions - ensuring that all levels of the company were aligned and informed. Regular update meetings would be held to keep everyone in the loop, with department heads subsequently cascading the information down to their teams. Next, streamlining and optimizing processes took center stage. The executives assessed and analyzed the existing procedures and then devised strategies to make them more efficient. This involved restructuring departments, assigning new roles, eliminating redundancies, and automating repetitive tasks through the latest technological advancements. By doing so, the company could not only save time but also resources, enabling them to allot more budget to future growth and innovation. Employee engagement and training were also deemed essential to make the business more organized. The plan incorporated regular employee feedback sessions and upgraded the training programs offered. These would be tailored to upskill the workforce, address any skill gaps, and ensure each employee was well-equipped to handle their roles effectively. To make the most of their available resources, better inventory management and budget allocation also formed a crucial part of the plan. This initiative would audit current inventory levels, establish reliable supply chain partnerships, and implement cost-saving measures to minimize financial waste. Moreover, the finance team would be tasked with reevaluating the budgets allocated to various departments to determine if the investments were wisely made and generated optimal returns. Lastly, the board emphasized the importance of establishing a robust company culture. Fostering values like transparency, collaboration, and innovation would be crucial in empowering employees to be proactive in resolving issues and taking ownership of their projects. A renewed focus on leadership development would help cultivate a motivated and accountable managerial force that could guide the business through the turbulence and successfully execute the plan. With the comprehensive plan in place, the stage was set for the company's revival. Timelines were assigned, measurements were established, and teams set to work on executing the various aspects of the plan with unwavering determination. Although the road ahead was challenging, the renewed sense of purpose and unity within the company rekindled hope that the business would not only regain its footing but emerge stronger and more organized than ever before. As the months passed, the impact of the plan began to take effect. Employees noticed improvements in efficiency and morale, while the financial reports showed clear signs of recovery. Slowly but surely, the business was being reshaped and rejuvenated, positioning itself to face the future with confidence and assurance, knowing that they overcame challenges and emerged as a more organized and efficient enterprise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The harmfulness of man's interference can be seen in what happened many years ago in the forest of the Kaibab plateau   of northern Arizona. Man tried to improve on the natural web of forest life and destroyed it instead. The Kaibab had a storybook forest of large sized pine, Douglas fir, white fir, blue and _ . In 1882 a visitor noted, \\"We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege   to visit.\\" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly. Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000. The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd  ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation   and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters.

This article: Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who said \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental?\\", using the article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite..., what would be the answer ?

Review title: Christmas Repulsed Product review: I love dance music, techno music, remixed music, and Christmas music, but I cannot love this album. Everytime I find a \\"remixed christmas\\" cd, I usually get it, just because I'm hoping someday there will be one that actually transforms traditional holiday songs into club anthems. Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend. They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer. This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march. It is so bad. There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers \\"Christmas\\", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid. If you don't believe me, listen to the samples, they won't lie to you. The answer to this question is:","output":"This review would decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. Here is a detailed analysis of the review: 1. The reviewer explicitly mentions not loving the album and seems disappointed with it despite being a fan of the genre. This statement indicates that the product did not meet their expectations and they would not recommend it. 2. The reviewer points out that \\"remixed Christmas\\" CDs generally have a disappointing trend, implying that the product in question is a part of this trend. This indicates that the album may not be unique or innovative in its approach to transforming holiday songs into club anthems. 3. While the reviewer acknowledges that this particular album might be better than most in the genre, they still highlight several issues with the majority of the tracks. For instance, \\"Carol of the Bells\\" is described as a poorly executed song that sounds like pots and pans banging to a slow funeral march. This negative description can deter potential buyers from making a purchasing decision. 4. The reviewer does provide some positive feedback for a few songs, like \\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\\" and \\"White Christmas,\\" but it does not outweigh their overall dissatisfaction with the album. 5. To support their opinion, the reviewer urges readers to listen to the samples for themselves, which suggests that the flaws in the album are evident and not solely based on the reviewer's personal taste. In conclusion, the detailed negative aspects shared in this review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product. The review suggests that the album does not fulfill the potential of a \\"remixed Christmas\\" CD and has disappointed someone who is a fan of the genre. As a result, potential buyers may be less inclined to purchase the product based on the reviewer's experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Michaels Stores Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, on Thursday confirmed that there was a security breach at certain systems that process payment cards at its U.S. stores and that of its unit, Aaron Brothers. The company said in January that it was working with federal law enforcement officials to investigate a possible data breach. Michaels Stores said the breach, which took place between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014, may have affected about 2.6 million cards, or about seven per cent of payment cards used at its stores during the period. Security breach: A statement from Michaels management indicates up to three million credit cards may have been compromised. The company said about 400,000 cards were potentially impacted at its Aaron Brothers unit by the breach, which occurred between June 26, 2013 and February 27, 2014. There was no evidence that data such as customers' name or personal identification number were at risk, Michaels Stores said in a statement. This is the second known data breach since 2011 at Michaels Stores. Michaels Stores, whose major investors are Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LP, said cyber security firms it hired found that malware not encountered previously had been used in the latest attack. The company said it was working with law enforcement authorities, banks and payment processors, and that the malware no longer presents a threat. Michaels Stores, which resubmitted its IPO documents late last month following a restructuring, is the latest U.S. retailer whose systems have been breached. Arts and crafts giant: Michaels has almost 900 stores around the country and in Canada. Last year, the number three U.S. retailer Target Corp suffered a massive security breach that resulted in the theft of some 70 million customer records. Reuters reported in January that smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target. U.S. retailers are planning to form an industry group for collecting and sharing intelligence in a bid to prevent future attacks. Michaels Stores, which owns several private brands such as Recollections, Artist's Loft and Loops & Threads, competes with Hooby Lobby Stores Inc, Jo-Ann Stores Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Michaels Stores, a big arts and crafts store in the US, recently found out that there was a security problem with some of their systems that handle payment cards. This means that some people's card information might have been stolen when they were shopping at Michaels Stores or another store they own, Aaron Brothers. Michaels said this happened between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014. They think around 2.6 million cards might have been affected but no names or personal numbers are at risk. This is the second time Michaels has had a security problem since 2011. They found out that a new type of bad software was used in the attack, and they are working with the police and banks to fix the problem. This is important because other big stores, like Target, also had security problems last year and many stores are now working together to make sure this doesn't keep happening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Henderson Island is a coral island raised above the South Pacific Ocean, No people live on it. The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life.     All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological   evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life.     On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

A:","output":"The task is asking you to analyze a sentence that includes a coordinating conjunction, which are \\"for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so\\". You need to decide whether the two clauses that the conjunction connects are in inverted order (the order is switched) or original order (the order is normal).  In the given example (\\"Damian tried to stay upright, but the sheer force threw him into the wall\\"), the coordinating conjunction used is \\"but\\". The first clause (\\"Damian tried to stay upright\\") is logically followed by the second clause (\\"the sheer force threw him into the wall\\") because the event in the second clause is the consequence of the what the first clause states. This suggests that the sentence is in original, not inverted, order. To decide the correct order, remember the common sequence of actions or results. If the first clause states an action and the second one its consequence, then it's usually in original order.

Her arms and legs resisted against the cool liquid, muscles tensing and releasing in smooth strokes. She could feel the excitement and freedom that came with each and every plunge, her eyes scanning the surface for any sign of disturbance. The sun was dipping low in the sky, casting a warm golden light over the dock and the surrounding landscape. It danced across the rippling water, casting playful shadows that moved and shifted as the waves responded to her movements. The air, too, was cool, a gentle breeze whispering through the trees as though trying to engage her in play. Ethan had finally made it into the water, his own entry less graceful than her feet-first dive. As she reached the dock, she couldn't help but let out a laugh as he sputtered and gasped, his face a mix of shock and delight. She pulled herself onto the wooden planks, water streaming off her body as she reached back to pull him up beside her. \\"Don't say I didn't warn you,\\" she teased, reaching out to steady him as he caught his breath. Despite the cool water still clinging to her skin, the warmth from the sun and her exertion had already begun to chase away the chill, leaving her feeling refreshed and alive. Together, they stood on the dock, watching as the sun continued its lazy descent towards the horizon. She smiled softly, feeling a sense of contentment settle over her as she breathed in the scents of the water, the earth, and the forest. In that moment, memories of hundreds of other days filled with laughter and splashes came flooding back. Days where she'd been tossed in or jumped willingly, each time feeling that same intoxicating thrill rush through her. As her thoughts gently meandered, she was pulled back to the present by the soft pressure of Ethan's hand on her shoulder, his fingers warm and steady against her still-damp skin. She looked up to see his eyes filled with an expression she couldn't quite name, but it filled her with warmth, as if the golden light they both bathed in had managed to seep inside her chest. She returned the touch, her hand finding his where it lay against her shoulder, giving it a tender squeeze. Together, they stood silently on the dock, the world before them bathed in the soft light of a dying day. Time seemed to stand still as they basked in the glow, their spirits entwined – a shared moment that would forever be etched in their hearts. They eventually pulled away from one another, their fingers reluctantly separating as the reality of their surroundings began to gently seep back in. With warm smiles and still-waterlogged laughs, they began their journey back to the shore, to a world of responsibilities and worries that would have to be faced. Yet, as they left the water and dock behind, they knew that they would always have this moment – a memory shaped by the sun and the water, forever the imprint of joy and companionship forged in the deepest corners of their souls. And it was with that comforting thought that they walked side by side, their footsteps dampened by the soft earth, hands brushing together as they continued on, the sinking sun at their back, and nothing but hope and love guiding their way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single?

Based on the sentence \\"A man bends down in an outdoor area that is also covered while birds walk around him.\\", is the sentence \\"The man is searching for something.\\" a true sentence?","output":"The sentence \\"A man bends down in an outdoor area that is also covered while birds walk around him.\\" does not explicitly state that the man is searching for something; however, it is possible to infer this interpretation based on the given information. It is important to acknowledge that there might be other possible reasons behind the man bending down and the provided sentence does not give enough context to state with certainty that \\"The man is searching for something.\\" is a true sentence. To better understand the situation, it is helpful to analyze the details given in the initial sentence. First, we know that the scene takes place in an outdoor area, suggesting that the man is interacting with his surrounding environment. Second, the area is covered, which implies that the location might offer some form of shelter or shade. This could be a structure like a gazebo, a park shelter, or a shaded space under trees. Lastly, we know that birds are walking around the man, which could indicate that the location is a natural setting or that the man might be in proximity to food sources attracting the birds. Based on these details and the man's action of bending down, it is reasonable to infer that he may be searching for something. Here are several possible scenarios: 1) The man could have dropped an item, and he is bending down to retrieve it. 2) The man might be examining or observing the birds closely by bending down to their level. 3) The man could be engaged in an activity that requires bending down, such as gardening or picking up litter. While the statement \\"The man is searching for something.\\" could be a potential interpretation of the original sentence, it would involve making assumptions that are not clearly supported by the given information.

Media playback is not supported on this device Fly-half Sam Davies conjured a rare - and pivotal - flash of quality to send Josh Matavesi in for the game's only try with a superb reverse pass. Davies converted the score and kicked two penalties to Duncan Weir's three for Edinburgh. The defeat is the Scottish side's fifth in succession and they remain ninth in the league table. It was another foul night at Myreside; cold, wet and breezy. The Ospreys and Edinburgh exist in different worlds in the Pro 12, the visitors pursuing the top four and a title while the home side were merely trying to get the win that has eluded them for so long. Edinburgh owned the opening 20 minutes but a lack of imagination, and wet conditions, plus stout resistance meant they led by just three points from Weir's boot. Even that tiny advantage was eliminated soon after when Davies knocked over a penalty of his own. Twenty minutes had been played and the Ospreys hadn't yet fired a shot. They hadn't even got into Edinburgh's 22. That changed quickly when Ospreys carved Edinburgh open with a rare moment of class in an otherwise poor contest. It was Davies who created it, a little show-and-go then a nicely-timed pass to Matavesi arriving on an unstoppable line. Clinical. Davies added the conversion to make it 10-3. Edinburgh had their chances to turn it around. Chance after chance in fact. They spent an inordinate amount of time in the opposition half as the game went on, but couldn't break through what is the Pro 12's best defence. There was controversy when Edinburgh fired up a close-range, fast-moving maul that the Ospreys collapsed. They were awarded a penalty, but no penalty try. Edinburgh went for touch instead of the posts and then, painfully, knocked on to allow the Ospreys to lift the siege. Amid all of this was the desperately sad sight of Alasdair Dickinson being stretchered off on his comeback after 10 weeks on the sidelines. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter will await the medical report with something approaching dread. Weir made it 10-6 with the boot but it needed to be more given their weight of possession. Davies kicked the visitors back into a seven-point lead but Weir brought it back down to four. Continually, though, Edinburgh mistake followed Edinburgh mistake. Ospreys hung on to go top - and their organisation and thunder in defence was the difference, apart from Davies' gorgeous creativity for the only try. For Edinburgh, a fifth straight loss in what is an increasingly turbulent season. Edinburgh acting head coach Duncan Hodge: \\"It was a tough night to play rugby, and they got one chance and took it. That seven points was a big cushion on a night like this. We had chances; we didn't help ourselves with little mistakes. \\"We had a line-out five metres out that looked like it was going over the line at a rate of knots, and we don't get a break there. It's a tough one to take. \\"The bottom line is, the decision is made by the referee. That's just incredibly tough, on a night like this, you've got an advantage like that. Seven points makes a huge difference to how you play the game, and we just didn't get that break. \\"I don't know (the latest on Alasdair Dickinson's injury). It's terrible for Dicko and he'll be absolutely distraught. You can imagine what he's been through the last nine months, to be back on the field for 45 minutes and get carted off, it's not what anyone wanted to see.\\" Edinburgh: Blair Kinghorn; Damien Hoyland, Glenn Bryce, Chris Dean, Rory Scholes; Duncan Weir, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne; Alasdair Dickinson, Neil Cochrane (capt), Murray McCallum, Grant Gilchrist, Ben Toolis, Magnus Bradbury, Jamie Ritchie, Cornell Du Preez.

Via a flashback, we learn about the couple's humble beginnings and discover how they worked their way into the world of the nouveau riche. David is a Santa Rosa attorney with no clients, working on construction jobs with his law partner Robert Townsend to support his bride, who serves as the struggling firm's secretary. Finding herself pregnant, Joyce schemes to land Swanson, a former factory worker with a valuable steel-making patent, as a client. She succeeds at getting him to hire David alone, and when her plot eventually is discovered, Robert quits. David is furious with his wife, but she placates him by convincing him her sole intent was to help him and their unborn child. Back in the present, Joyce is forced to admit to her daughters their father has left her when a society columnist questions his move. She learns from a friend David has been seen with another woman and hires a private detective to investigate. Another flashback, and David, now an executive in Swanson's company, announces he has been transferred to San Francisco but wants to live in the suburbs.

Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\".   His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of Manuel Garcia's singing class, but it is certain that he... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was given his first lessons on the organ by George Cooper?, what is it ?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is \\"In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Why would one use hydrogen mixed with nitrogen?\\"","output":"Yes, the statement \\"In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection.\\" provides a relevant answer to the question \\"Why would one use hydrogen mixed with nitrogen?\\". However, if you are looking for a more detailed and longer answer, consider the following: Hydrogen and nitrogen, when mixed together, form a gas called forming gas. This combination serves several purposes: 1. Leak detection: As mentioned in the original statement, the primary application of forming gas is to serve as a tracer gas for detecting minute leaks in a wide range of industrial systems, such as pipelines, tanks, and storage vessels. Hydrogen, being the smallest and lightest molecule, has an exceptional ability to penetrate even the tiniest of leaks, making it an ideal tracer element. In addition, hydrogen can easily be detected using specialized equipment, such as hydrogen leak detectors. 2. Safety concerns: Pure hydrogen gas can be flammable and explosive when mixed with air at concentrations between 4% and 75%. Mixing it with an inert gas like nitrogen reduces the risk of fire and explosion by diluting the hydrogen concentration. Nitrogen makes up the majority of forming gas—generally between 95% and 99%—ensuring that it is non-flammable and significantly safer to use. 3. Cost-effectiveness: Hydrogen is a less expensive tracer gas option compared to alternatives, such as helium. The lower cost of hydrogen makes forming gas a highly cost-effective solution in leak detection, particularly in industries that require large volumes for testing and maintenance. 4. Environmental impact: Hydrogen and nitrogen both occur naturally in the atmosphere and do not contribute significantly to air pollution when released. While other tracer gases may contribute to the greenhouse effect or ozone depletion, the use of forming gas has a relatively low environmental impact. This further adds to its appeal as a preferred tracer gas for many industries. 5. Welding applications: Forming gas is also used in certain welding applications, specifically reducing the oxidation of metal surfaces during the welding process. The combination of hydrogen and nitrogen in forming gas acts as a shielding medium, thereby creating a protective atmosphere around the weld zone that helps mitigate the negative effects of oxidation. In conclusion, using hydrogen mixed with nitrogen addresses multiple concerns, such as safety and cost, while maintaining its primary purpose as an effective tracer gas for minute leak detection. Additionally, the gas mixture boasts a lower environmental impact than some other tracer gases. For these reasons, forming gas has become a popular option across various industries, including applications beyond leak detection, such as some welding processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Disgraced football legend O.J. Simpson is scheduled to return to a Las Vegas courtroom Monday in a bid to get his robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out. The one-time Heisman Trophy winner and Buffalo Bills halfback is more than four years into a 33-year prison term and is asking for a new trial. In court papers, he's arguing that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers. Simpson not only accuses his old lawyer, Yale Galanter, of having a conflict of interest and of failing to mount an effective defense in his trial. He also says Galanter told him before that confrontation that he was within his rights to take back property he believed had been stolen from him, \\"so long as there would be no trespass and no physical force used against the persons with the property.\\" Simpson, 65, was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back the items from the two dealers. \\"Simpson also contends that Galanter did not advise Simpson that carrying out the plan could subject him to criminal charges, regardless of the ownership of the property,\\" his new lawyers wrote in seeking a new trial. Simpson also blames Galanter for preventing him from testifying in his own defense. Without putting him on the stand, \\"There was no evidence presented to adequately challenge the state's evidence of criminal intent and knowledge of the guns or the bad character evidence to which the jury was exposed,\\" his appeal states. The Nevada Supreme Court already upheld his conviction in 2010. Prosecutors have called the new attempt to reverse his conviction \\"without merit,\\" and Galanter is quoted in court papers as telling the judge in the original trial that he spoke to Simpson only after the confrontation. \\"Other than Simpson's bare allegations, the record does not support any conflict of interest,\\" prosecutors wrote in response to Simpson's claims. Galanter could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday. Simpson's October 2008 conviction came on the anniversary of his famous acquittal on murder charges in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Though cleared of criminal charges, a civil jury later slapped him with a 33 million wrongful-death judgment, and lawyers for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued his assets. His current sentence leaves him eligible for parole in 2017. Documentary: Serial killer, not O.J., killed Simpson and Goldman. Highlights:","output":"1. O.J.

Summarize: The retail billionaire and former BHS owner said he was \\"not prepared to participate\\" with the work and pensions committee hearing, scheduled for Wednesday, unless Mr Field stands down. In a letter, he said the MP was biased and conducting a \\"trial by media\\". Mr Field had told the Financial Times he \\"would laugh\\" if less than £600m was offered to settle BHS's pension debts. Meanwhile shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for Sir Philip to be stripped of his knighthood if he fails to attend a session on Wednesday to answer MPs' questions. He told the Observer that the move would \\"help restore public faith in the honours system\\". Reacting to news of the letter, which he said he had yet to receive, Mr Field said: \\"The House of Commons decides who chairs these committees, not Sir Philip Green. It's in his interest to turn up.\\" And Business Minister Anna Soubry tweeted: \\"Sir Philip needs to understand Parliament is the boss, get a grip [and] get in front of the committee on Weds.\\" Attempts to find a buyer to rescue the chain of department stores failed earlier this month, and it was announced it would close with the loss of up to 11,000 jobs. Sir Philip, whose Arcadia Group sold BHS for £1 to a former bankrupt in 2015, has been accused of taking money out of BHS while the pension fund sank deep into deficit. He is scheduled to answer MPs' questions about the sale on Wednesday. However, in a strongly worded letter he claimed the outcome of the inquiry was \\"pre-determined\\", and Mr Field had used his position as committee chairman \\"to destroy my reputation\\" ahead of the hearing. \\"I am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation,\\" he wrote. \\"I therefore require you to resign immediately from this inquiry.\\" 163 stores to close 11,000 jobs at risk, including: 8,000 members of staff and 3,000 non-BHS employees who work in the stores A spokesman for Sir Philip Green's retail group Arcadia later clarified his position saying Sir Philip was waiting to see how Mr Field replies to his letter before deciding whether to attend on Wednesday. He added: \\"This doesn't appear to be a proper process any more. This is mob rule.\\" by Joe Lynam, BBC business reporter Both Frank Field and Sir Philip Green are taking a gamble with this stand-off. Sir Philip must know that Mr Field will never resign at his behest and ordering him to do so won't look great. But Mr Field also knows that publicly disparaging the retail tycoon may give the latter the excuse he needs to not to attend a grilling by MPs. Although the Thatcher Room in Portcullis House is not a court of law, it could be seen as the court of public opinion. If that's the case, then calling for Sir Philip to be stripped of his knighthood before the Arcadia boss even takes his seat next Wednesday, doesn't sound like Frank Field has an open mind. Of course we could have a situation where Sir Philip attends next week but folds his arms in silence every time Frank Field (who is co-chairing this inquiry) asks a question. We shall wait and see. On Friday, the Financial Times quoted Mr Field as saying £600m was needed to cover BHS's pension hole, which affects more than 20,000 people. If Sir Philip's proposal amounted to \\"anything less than that, the committee will just laugh at him\\", he said. \\"The committee may have considered a reasonable settlement in the very early days of our inquiry, but things have changed.\\" Sir Philip has previously said he would appear before the committee on condition that his wife Tina Green, who owns a company which controls Arcadia Group, was not called.

Few would argue that football is the planet's true global game. From Baghdad to Buenos Aires it is watched, played, argued about, loved and hated with an intensity that no other sport can match. Its ubiquity also brings a tremendous amount of power. Dictators and politicians have long tried to harness its ability to inspire unity and national pride for more nefarious political purposes -- be it Argentina's junta who used the 1978 World Cup to inspire the kind of loyalty that its regime had failed to do, to current Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who feared and respected football's power to spark change in equal measure. \\"[Football] has caused at least one war and many battles, often tragic, off the pitch,\\" wrote Melvyn Bragg, nominating the 1863 Rules of Association Football, the football's first official code, in his \\"Twelve Books That Changed the World.\\" But sometimes a single match has been at the center of huge social and political changes. Ahead of the start of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, CNN gives you some of the games that changed the world. Secretary's XI versus President's XI (1864) When 22 men gathered in Battersea Park, London, in the winter of 1864 for a game of football, no-one could imagine the worldwide sporting revolution that would follow. This was the first game played according to the Rules of Association Football, written by the embryonic English Football Association and the first attempt to unite and codify football's different, not to mention competing, strands. The forward pass hadn't been introduced yet, there were no such thing as crossbars and the offside rule was still three years away from being introduced, but the British Victorian need for imprimatur and order meant that the simplified, slimmed-down rules -- just 13 laws -- were easily exported. Which the British did with a proselytizing zeal throughout its colonies and the rest of the world. One such football missionary was Charles William Miller, who in the mid-1890s took a copy of the rules and a football to Brazil, from where it caught on like wild fire. \\"A Brazilian taxi driver told me that Charles Miller had invented football. In other words, he's a legendary figure [in Brazil], but no-one is quite sure what the legend actually is,\\" explained Josh Lacey, author of \\"God is Brazilian,\\" a biography of Miller. \\"In Sao Paulo, there is a square named after him. It's the square outside the stadium where Corinthians play.\\" And the match itself? The Secretary's XI won 2-0, with both goals scored by Charles William Alcock, who would himself go on to organize the very first international fixture, between England and Scotland, seven years later. West Germany versus Hungary (1954) Post-war Germany was a haunted, broken and divided place. Although it was devastated financially by the folly of Nazism and the split between east and west by the emergence of the Iron Curtain, Germans were in a soul-searching funk over their role in the Second World War. The singing of the national anthem was actively discouraged and the country's new, unloved flag was rarely seen. And then came the \\"Miracle of Bern\\" at the 1954 World Cup, held in Switzerland. Despite being trounced 8-3 in their first match against Hungary, West Germany made it to the final of the World Cup to face the same opposition. The team was made up solely of amateur footballers, while Hungary -- the best team in the world at the time -- boasted the likes of Ferenc Puskas. No-one gave them a chance, but they won 3-2, sparking scenes of jubilation back in West Germany and the first positive, collective nationalistic outburst since the war. \\"It was a kind of liberation for the Germans from all the things that weighed down upon them after the Second World War,\\" German historian Joachim Fest wrote. \\"July 4, 1954 is in certain aspects the founding day of the German Republic.\\" From there West Germany boomed economically, becoming the leading nation in Europe. As newspaper Der Spiegel pointed out before a united Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup: \\"In one 90-minute match against Hungary, modern-day Germany was born.\\" Rangers versus Bucks (1966) Robben Island is infamous for its most revered prisoner: Nelson Mandela. But the jail, which held what the apartheid South African state viewed to be the most dangerous political prisoners, also gave birth to an unlikely football league. The Makana Football Association was set up by a group of prisoners desperate to break the monotony of prison life. Every week from 1964 onwards a prisoner would ask for permission to play football, and then be punished by the authorities as a result of his temerity. But by 1966 the prison warden relented and a football league was set up based on one of the only books in the prison library: the FIFA rule book. Scores, leagues, disciplinary records and even the results of disciplinary hearings from on-pitch indiscretions were kept, although no record exists of the score between the Rangers and Bucks in the first-ever match. As well as giving the inmates hope during desperate times, the Makana FA had a more important impact: honing the administrative skills of South Africa's future leaders. Jacob Zuma, the current President, was a tough-tackling defender for the Bucks and a future Makana FA referee. \\"It taught them administration ... Robben Island created the new generation of people that struggled for freedom,\\" explains Professor Chuck Korr, author of \\"More Than Just a Game: Football vs. Apartheid.\\" \\"And those men thought football was very important in maintaining their sanity and hope for the future. By definition, football is absolutely essential in the way the struggle for freedom is won.\\" The Makana FA, although long abandoned, was given honorary FIFA membership in 2007. Dinamo Zagreb versus Red Star Belgrade (1990) Yugoslavia was already on the brink of imploding by the time Serbia's Red Star Belgrade played Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb at the latter's Maksimir Stadium. Pro- independence parties had already won recent Croatian elections. But the events that unfolded on March 13, 1990 are regarded by many as the opening salvo of the most vicious European war since the Nazis were defeated in 1945. During the match, future AC Milan and Croatia captain Zvonimir Boban launched a kung-fu kick at a policeman who was attacking a Zagreb fan. Riots broke out between Zagreb's \\"Bad Blue Boys\\" ultra group, and Red Star's \\"Delije\\" -- led by the brutal war-lord Arkan. Arkan's Tiger's, the paramilitary group he ruled during the war, recruited heavily from the Delije. Arkan himself was indicted by the United Nations for war crimes, but was assassinated in 2000 before he stood trial. Later, Boban explained what was going through his head. \\"Here I was, a public face prepared to risk his life, career and everything that fame could have brought, all because of one ideal cause: the Croatian cause.\\" For the rest of the soon-to-be-non-existent country, it was a symbolic moment. \\"It was the most important match in Yugoslav history,\\" explains Dr. Neven Andjelic, author of \\"Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy.\\" \\"It has political implications and is a clear sign of the forthcoming violence and war that this unfinished match provided to the population.\\" The war went on to rage for five years, with the International Center for Transnational Justice estimating that 140,000 people were killed. Its effects are still evident today, not least outside the Maksimir Stadium, where a statue depicting a group of soldiers stands. On it is the inscription: \\"To the fans of the club, who started the war with Serbia at this ground on May 13, 1990.\\" Iraq versus Saudi Arabia (2007) Younis Mahmoud ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with the handful of fans that had made the long journey to the vast, half-empty stand in Jakarta's Bung Karno stadium. The captain of the Iraq national team -- a team of Kurds, Sunni and Shia Muslims -- had just scored the only, decisive goal in the 2007 Asian Cup final on July 29 against Saudi Arabia, but it meant much more than the first piece of major silverware for the \\"Lions of Mesopotamia.\\" Back in Baghdad, tens of thousands of Iraqis poured into the streets, firing celebratory bullets into the air, with many clutching something that had not been seen in numbers since the fall of Saddam: the Iraqi flag. Football had achieved what no politician or general had managed to achieve: a semblance of national unity. According to the U.S. military, there were 1,700 sectarian attacks in Baghdad alone in June 2007. That had almost halved after the final, to 960 by the end of August. But the victory came at a price. Minutes after Iraq had beaten South Korea in a penalty shoot out in the semifinal, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowd of cheering fans, killing 50 people. At the Asian Cup, the victorious team sat, stunned, in the dressing room and contemplated pulling out of the final. But then the players watched the carnage on television. \\"One of the victims was a 12-year-old child,\\" recalled Mahmoud to the press afterwards. \\"His mother, when his body was laid in front of her, she didn't weep, but she said: 'I present my son as a sacrifice for the Iraqi national team.' We have to win.\\" They chose to continue, and the rest is history. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa.  But I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, had returned home from a party when an argument escalated to physical violence. The unfortunate event began when the couple attended a party on Sunday night. However, their evening took a dark turn when they returned home. What had begun as a disagreement quickly spiraled out of control. Family members were not only alarmed but also affected by the situation. Juan's mother, Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, 45, attempted to intervene when the couple started fighting. Concerned about the safety of her family, she wanted to prevent the altercation from escalating further. However, her efforts to maintain peace didn't yield the desired outcome. In the heat of the moment, Hernandez Soriano allegedly assaulted Rojas-Jovel. The consequences of this attack were severe and unexpected. Rojas-Jovel tragically suffered a cardiac arrest due to the incident. When the local police arrived on the scene, they discovered Rojas-Jovel deceased, finding victim and family in a state of shock and distress. The aftermath of this tragic event not only resulted in the loss of a life but also left a deep emotional impact on the family. Adding to the tragedy was the presence of a seven-year-old girl, who witnessed the entire ordeal. The incident has certainly placed a considerable psychological burden on the young girl, who was present during such a horrific event at her tender age. This unfortunate incident serves as a harrowing reminder of the devastating ramifications that can result from domestic disputes. In this case, what started as a disagreement between a couple ended with the heartbreaking loss of a family member – a loss that could have been avoided with better conflict resolution and understanding between the involved parties. While many details are still under investigation, the incident has left a deep scar on the involved family and their community. It's a somber reminder that in contentious situations, cooler heads must prevail to prevent such heartbreaking outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the kidney becomes more active, it will result in more waste being passed to the bladder. Step 2: Identify the factors involved in the process a. Kidneys b. Renal artery c. Nephrons d. Waste removal e. Renal vein f. Ureters g. Bladder Step 3: Identify the main function of the kidneys The kidneys filter the blood, removing waste materials and balancing electrolytes by adjusting the levels of water and ions. Step 4: Understand the impact of increased kidney activity If kidney activity increases, it is likely that they would filter more blood within the same time frame. As a result, more waste might be removed from the blood, leading to increased waste production. Step 5: Determine how increased waste production affects the bladder As the kidneys filter more waste from the blood, they will transport more urine containing the waste to the bladder through the ureters. An increased waste passing to the bladder means that it will fill up more quickly. Step 6: Assess the potential effects caused by the perturbation hypothesis In cases where the perturbation hypothesis holds true, the following effects may be observed: a. More waste will be removed from the blood in the same amount of time. b. The bladder will fill up more quickly and require more frequent emptying. Step 7: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process. If the kidneys become more active and filter more blood, they will remove more waste and pass it to the bladder.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County.

In both sentences, the word has different meanings based on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence — \\"He made trade protection a plank in the party platform\\" — the word \\"protection\\" refers specifically to trade protection, which is a political and economic policy aimed at regulating and sheltering domestic industries from foreign competition. This is usually accomplished through the imposition of tariffs, import quotas, and other measures that restrict or control the flow of foreign goods and services into the domestic market. In this context, the word \\"protection\\" is used to emphasize the defensive and supportive aspect of the policy, as well as its primary goal of preserving and promoting the interests of domestic industries. Here, the term \\"protection\\" has an economic and political connotation. In the second sentence — \\"Insurance provided protection against loss of wages due to illness\\" — the word \\"protection\\" has a more general meaning, and it refers to the safeguarding of an individual's or organization's financial interests in the face of potential risks, losses, or damages. In this case, the protection is offered by an insurance policy, which typically agrees to compensate the policyholder for certain types of losses (such as a loss of wages due to illness) in exchange for a regular payment called a premium. Here, the term \\"protection\\" has a financial and risk management connotation. In summary, while the word \\"protection\\" is used in both sentences, its meaning and implications are context-dependent. In the first sentence, it pertains to the realm of trade and economics, focusing on shielding domestic industries from international competition. In the second sentence, it relates to the insurance and risk management domains, addressing the safeguarding of an individual's or organization's financial interests.

Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like  Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah.  Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished.  By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.

Plant a variety of seasonals and perennials to suit your own preferences. The delightful colors and fragrances of a flower bed can add an idyllic beauty to your home.  Consult with a gardening expert to see what types of flowers grow best in your region’s particular climate. Don’t overwater flowers. Unlike fast-growing plants like grass and shrubs, flowers don’t require as much moisture on average, and watering too often may cause them to wither. Many people have begun sewing small patches of crops right in their own backyards. Decide what you’d like to grow—beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, squash; your options are nearly limitless—and make sure the soil is thoroughly aerated and suitable to grow vegetables in. Raising your own small batches of vegetables will give your yard a utilitarian appeal while providing you and your family with fresh, homegrown food to enjoy all summer long.  Use organic compost to help vegetable crops absorb vital nutrients. If yard space is an issue, considering planting your vegetables on a vertical trellis, or even in a compact grower that you can keep inside your own house!  Pick ripe vegetables immediately to keep pests from feeding on them. Build a simple wooden fence to mark your property and give your yard a sense of peaceful containment. Fences can be useful for offering a little privacy if you live in a crowded neighborhood, as well as keeping out animals that may trample and devour plants. If you contract with a handyman, ask them about the materials and expenses needed to put a fence around your yard. If you have an especially large yard, or one that is divided up with shrubs, flower beds or amenities like a pool or fire pit, you might construct a simple stepping stone path out of flagstones or wooden planks. A footpath can give you an expedient way to traverse your yard or garden without wearing down the grass, is easy to build and has a pleasant, quaint aesthetic. Take a look at these resources for simple plans to lay down a footpath: You’ll be spending a lot of time outside this summer, so make sure you do it in leisure. Purchase some nice, sturdy lawn chairs to give you a place to sit and sip lemonade on a hot day. If space permits, you could even set up an entire dining set to host picnics. Study the layout of plants, trees and shrubs to decide on the best way to arrange the furniture, and turn your yard into a relaxing outdoor lounge.   Be sure that you’re buying furniture with water-resistant cushions and surfaces. This way, you won’t have to worry about bringing it in every time it rains. Water-resistant outdoor furniture is often cleaned easily, as well. Place a small bench within a garden for a nice seating area, or lay out some reclining chairs somewhere unshaded for sunbathing.

Given the question: Given the background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  and the situation: In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B.  Answer the following question: Which group of antelope is more adapted to the environment? The answer is:","output":"Group A of antelope is more adapted to the environment in sub-Saharan Africa. This is because their longer necks and stronger teeth enable them to more easily pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region, compared to the antelope from Group B who have shorter necks and weaker teeth. This suggests that the individuals in Group A have developed advantageous traits that make them more \\"fit\\" to survive in their specific environment, which in turn leads to greater reproductive success and increased prevalence of these traits in their population over time. This is an example of natural selection and adaptation in action, as explained by the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.  But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In which area has excavations uncovered substantial evidence of habitation? ?  The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already. She is a woman after my own heart. Her book inspires you to give it a go. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Article: There is a time when Karyn Bosnak couldn't pay a 59 bill at the grocery store. She was officially broke. She didn't have enough money to get on the subway, but she looked rich. She was a television producer, earned 900 a week, and had a closetful of designer labels like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay. In her closet, where the Gucci purse once sat, Karyn keeps all the letters that people have sent her. It's hard to understand why so many people helped a total stranger pay off her huge credit card bill. Karyn explains, \\"I was just honest about what happened; I didn't make up some sob story   about saving the world.\\" Her donors think it's funny and original, and view it less as a charity than as an entertainment site. Imitators have appeared all over the Internet, some with extremely selfish requests for things like a BMW or a house. Actually, Karyn was not the first person to put up a website asking strangers for money. The practice has a name: \\"cyber-begging.\\" Most sites receive little traffic and even less cash. Karyn also had thousands of enemies and critics. People sent her hate mail and scolded   her on websites.

However, she suffers from recurring nightmares and inexplicable anxiety that starts to disrupt her daily life. Her concerned family, unsure of how to help, take her to Dr. Bensley, a renowned psychiatrist with an impeccable record of helping patients overcome their traumas. Act 2: The Treatment From their first session, Dr. Bensley (played by a talented actor like Anthony Hopkins or Meryl Streep) manages to establish a strong connection with Mary. As their weekly sessions continue, Dr. Bensley delves into the depths of Mary's subconscious, revealing disturbing memories from her past. As they uncover more details about her childhood, a shocking truth begins to emerge – Mary was abused as a child by someone she trusted. The trauma had been repressed for years, but the nightmares and anxiety stemmed from these unresolved issues. Act 3: Unraveling the Truth Dr. Bensley helps Mary confront this painful truth, enabling her to process and come to terms with her past. Although their sessions are filled with dark moments and intense emotion, Mary gradually learns to trust Dr. Bensley and relies on their bond to guide her through this difficult journey. However, as Mary starts to investigate further, she begins to suspect that there is more to Dr. Bensley than meets the eye. She starts to question whether the psychiatrist is truly helping her or manipulating her memories for some hidden agenda. Act 4: The Revelation Determined to unearth the truth, Mary investigates Dr. Bensley's past and uncovers a shocking connection – the psychiatrist had been a close friend of her family when she was a child and had a direct involvement in her traumatic past. The revelation shakes Mary to her core and shatters the trust she had placed in Dr. Bensley. Act 5: Confrontation and Resolution Mary confronts Dr. Bensley with the uncovered evidence, demanding an explanation for the betrayal. Initially defensive, Dr. Bensley finally breaks down and confesses that they participated in covering up the abuse due to threats and blackmail from the abuser. Consumed with guilt, Dr. Bensley went on to become a psychiatrist in an attempt to repent for their past actions. With the truth finally out, Mary decides to sever her ties with Dr. Bensley, and instead work on rebuilding her life and overcoming her trauma on her own terms. She reclaims her strength and pushes forward, forging a new path to healing and self-discovery. The Labyrinth of the Mind explores themes of trust, deception, recovery, and the powerful bond that exists between therapist and patient, all while shedding light on the lingering impact of childhood trauma."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who instinctively uses their abilities to convince their supervisor that they are a different class?

Write a text based on this summary: guinean troops deploy in town after riots over energy prices Text:","output":"Title: Guinean Troops Deployed in Town Following Riots Over Energy Price Hikes In recent days, the town of Guinea has witnessed unprecedented civil unrest prompted by surging energy prices. Angered citizens took to the streets to voice their frustration, leading to a series of protest-related riots. In response to the escalating tensions and to restore order, Guinean authorities have deployed troops throughout the affected areas. Over the past few months, Guinea, a West African country known for its rich resources, has been grappling with soaring energy costs. The rise in prices has been attributed to various factors, including fluctuations in global oil prices, inflation, and inadequacies in the country's energy infrastructure. The combination of these factors has culminated in a public outcry, with citizens demanding immediate action from the government to alleviate the harsh impact of the rising energy prices on daily life. The government's decision to deploy troops in strategic locations within the town is indicative of its commitment to safeguarding against further outbreaks of violence. This move aims to secure public safety and deter any potential criminal activity, such as looting and property damage, which have been occurring amidst the riots. The presence of a formidable law enforcement force also hopes to restore a sense of calm and stability, encouraging citizens to engage in peaceful dialogue and seek democratic resolutions to their grievances. While the deployment of troops may serve as a temporary solution to the current unrest, it highlights the underlying issues Guinea faces concerning its energy sector. The country's reliance on imported oil and its rudimentary energy infrastructure have made it susceptible to fluctuations in global energy costs. Indeed, this vulnerability has been starkly revealed in the recent riots, as citizens find their quality of life affected by factors beyond their control. To address this situation, the Guinean government will need to implement sustainable solutions that diversify the country's energy sources and build a more resilient energy infrastructure. This could involve investing in renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, and partnering with international organizations to finance the development of more sustainable energy projects. By doing so, Guinea can secure a more stable and affordable energy future for its citizens, ultimately mitigating the risk of further unrest. In the meantime, it is crucial for the government to engage in open dialogue with the public, demonstrating a willingness to acknowledge and address their concerns. Adopting a transparent and responsive approach can go a long way in rebuilding trust between the authorities and the citizens, an essential prerequisite for meaningful, positive change. As the situation unfolds, the international community will observe with keen interest how Guinea responds to its current challenges. The recent deployment of troops may have halted the chain of violent incidents for now, but lasting peace will only be achieved through sustainable reforms and constructive communication between the government and its people. If successful, these efforts may pave the way for other countries to follow suit, employing multi-faceted approaches to combat the global issue of energy price volatility and its impact on social stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: Bridget Jones's Diary makes me snort. I mean that literally. I emit a scornful guttural sound whenever I see it, which, unfortunately, happens a lot in my house. It's one of my wife's go-to cable movies (as opposed to a more sensible choice like, say, Patton), and it definitely doesn't make her snort. It makes her laugh and smile and sometimes tear up, especially when Colin Firth is on the screen. This problem has long been irreconcilable (the movie came out nine years ago), but thanks to a new study by a pair of German and British researchers, we may someday be able to hug it out. According to their findings, all it would take is a quick squirt of the hormone oxytocin up my nose, and I'd be swooning over Bridget too. What's more, past research has shown that the same chemical that could smooth over a couple's differences in cinematic taste might also be used in labs and hospitals to mitigate much more serious social-relation problems, like those associated with autism and schizophrenia. (See the top 10 medical breakthroughs of 2009.) Pumped out by the hypothalamus, oxytocin is known more colloquially as the \\"cuddle chemical.\\" As any pregnant woman knows and any spouse of a pregnant woman learns, it soars during labor and nursing, triggering contractions and aiding in the letdown of milk, and plays a major role in mother-baby bonding. New dads get a big slug of the stuff in their bloodstream too, but usually not until after the baby is born. Oxytocin is also partly responsible for even getting couples to the new-parent stage: it's released in both men and women during sex, giving post-romp bonding a chemical boost. Psychiatrist Rene Hurlemann of Bonn University and neuroscientist Keith Kendrick of the Cambridge Babraham Institute were well acquainted with the power of oxytocin when it's released the way nature intended. What they wanted to determine is if it could be artificially administered to a person to manipulate feelings of empathy and perhaps even learning. \\"Both learning and empathy are part of what's known as social cognition,\\" says Hurlemann. \\"That's our ability to feel what other people are feeling and take their point of view.\\" (See the world's most influential people in the 2010 TIME 100.) To test how oxytocin might affect those capabilities, Hurlemann and Kendrick ran a two-part experiment. In the first, 48 males were divided into two groups  half received an aerosol shot of oxytocin and half got a placebo  and then shown evocative pictures of things like a crying child, a grieving man and a girl hugging a cat. They were then asked to describe how deeply they were feeling the emotions associated with the pictures. On the whole, the men in the oxytocin group exhibited \\"significantly higher emotional empathy levels\\" than those in the placebo group. This, despite the fact that all of the volunteers were able to describe and understand what was going on in the pictures and what the people in them were probably feeling. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were given a simple on-screen exercise that tested their ability to observe certain details in images or words. Sometimes correct answers were indicated by a green circle and incorrect ones by a red one; other times a happy face and a disapproving face were substituted. All of the men learned more quickly when the faces were used, but the difference was particularly marked among those in the oxytocin group. \\"You got a combined effect,\\" Hurlemann says. \\"You enhance empathy and in the process, you enhance social learning.\\" (See the top 10 scientific discoveries of 2009.) In the home, the oxytocin implications could be enormous. Husbands could learn to melt at Olympic ice dancing; wives could swoon over a Drew Brees bomb. Is Glenn Beck crying? Now your blue-state mate can too! But the hormone  in theory at least  could have more meaningful implications. If healthy social behavior turns in part on being able to feel the pain of others, antisocial behavior involves an ability to observe  or even cause  that kind of suffering and not experience any of it yourself. Could oxytocin change that? \\"It's an interesting possibility,\\" says Hurlemann. \\"For instance, someone who didn't sympathize with handicapped people might learn to with oxytocin. You'd probably have to administer it just once, because you learn the feeling forever.\\" (See TIME's special report \\"How to Live 100 Years.\\") That's a little too Clockwork Orange for most people, but other potential therapeutic uses could be more benign  and perhaps even game-changing. Both schizophrenia and autism are defined by a lack of social feeling and an inability to read facial and other cues. In a study last February at the Centre de Neuroscience Cognitive in Lyon, France, investigators administered oxytocin spray to 13 children with mild autism. After treatment, the participants were better able to read body-language cues during a game of catch, and when looking at photographs of faces, they spent more time studying the images  especially the eyes  than they would have otherwise.

The transformation of this sentence to lowercase demonstrates how the visual aspect of text can influence the way in which we perceive and interpret the information being presented. By altering the original sentence and removing any capitalization, the text appears less formal and more approachable. This change in appearance invites readers to engage with the message being conveyed in a more relaxed and informal manner. Furthermore, the transition from uppercase to lowercase allows for an increased emphasis on the specific words and phrases within the sentence. As there are no capital letters to rigidly structure the text, readers are more likely to analyze the content carefully and extract meaning from the individual words and their arrangement. In this particular sentence, the use of lowercase emphasizes the architectural elements and the passage of time. The three brick-clad buildings are highlighted as a symbol of beauty and emphasize the significance of their construction. Additionally, the mention of \\"many suggestions\\" and \\"Krøyers place\\" draws attention to the ongoing process of development and transformation that has taken place in recent years. Lowercase text does not suggest that the content is less critical or valuable. Instead, it reflects a stylistic approach that encourages greater reader engagement. As we read the sentence, we're still presented with a detailed picture of the architectural developments at Krøyers place. However, the overall atmosphere and tone of the sentence now feel more open and conversational, making it more accessible to a broader range of readers. In conclusion, making the sentence lower case brings attention to the specific elements of the text and encourages a deeper engagement with its contents. This change represents the power of language to affect our interpretation and invites an in-depth analysis of the interplay between style, tone, and information. The sentence, while less formal, manages to retain its original message - highlighting the beauty and progression of the brick-clad buildings of Krøyers place over time."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Jetboat.

Determine the sentiment: First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However, it wasn't the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story \\"The Bottle Imp\\". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end. In fact, I think it's preferable.","output":"To determine the sentiment, we can analyze the text and identify the positive and negative expressions.

Title: KEANU AND SANDRA'S TIME TRAVELING ADVENTURE Product review: I had read enough and seen enough about this movie to know what to expect. I admit it could be confusing at times knowing what year I was in, but the movie did a good job of giving you hints to figure it out without having to spell it out across the bottom of the screen (think Sixth Sense). The most obvious was the length of Sandra Bullock's hair. It was longer when she was in the past, and shorter during her current situation.I say keep an open mind and just enjoy this for what it is worth. There are too few \\"feel good\\" movies these days, so I appreciated seeing a movie that wasn't bloody or full of embarassing humor and curse words. I was even enlightened when Sandra asks, \\"What if you lived your whole life and there was no one waiting?\\"So what (or who) are you waiting for?

A: remain the same Aubrey  B: work harder  C: make their parents proud","output":"From the given context, we can gather that Aubrey values the wisdom and guidance his parents provide him with about life. This implies they have a strong bond and mutual respect. Therefore, we can interpret that Aubrey would likely aim to uphold his parents' teachings, follow their advice, and potentially make life choices that reflect their wisdom. Hence, when we examine the three given options, answer C: \\"make their parents proud\\" seems to fit best according to the context. Option A: \\"remain the same Aubrey\\" is a bit vague and doesn't imply any specific action or direction that Aubrey is likely to take based on the context. While this doesn't explicitly contradict what we know about Aubrey, it doesn't resonate with the notion of following parental advice or achieving something related to it.  Option B: \\"work harder\\" could potentially be true, as working hard is generally good advice. But this response isn't given any grounding in the provided context. It's an assumptive statement and doesn't specifically link to Aubrey's behavior guided by his parents' advice.  Option C: \\"make their parents proud\\" goes along with the idea of valuing and following parental advice. If Aubrey appreciates and implements his parents' advice about life, it's reasonable to deduce that he might wish to make them proud by using their teachings wisely and beneficially. Thus, it aligns best with the provided context and Aubrey's established character traits. In conclusion, considering the given context, the option that best answers the question \\"What will Aubrey want to do next?\\" would likely be \\"make their parents proud\\" as it directly links to the pattern of Aubrey's behavior and motivations strongly influenced by his parents' advice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria Paulo Pinheiro (L) delivers his report next to U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay during the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva March 11, 2013.      GENEVA (Reuters) - The Syrian government has stepped up indiscriminate, heavy bombardments of cities while rebels are executing prisoners condemned in their own makeshift courts without due process, U.N. investigators said on Monday.      The independent investigators said they were looking into 20 massacres committed by one or the other side and hundreds of \\"unlawful killings\\", cases of torture and arbitrary arrests since September in the two-year-old conflict.      \\"Indiscriminate and widespread shelling, the regular bombardment of cities, mass killing and the deliberate firing on civilian targets have come to characterize the daily lives of civilians in Syria,\\" Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the commission of inquiry on Syria, told the U.N. Human Rights Council.      The uprising in Syria erupted in March 2011 with largely peaceful protests but escalated into a civil war pitting mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, whose minority Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.      \\"In a disturbing and dangerous trend, mass killings allegedly perpetrated by Popular Committees have at times taken on sectarian overtones,\\" the 10-page U.N. report said. \\"Some appear to have been trained and armed by the government.\\"      Pro-Assad Popular Committee militiamen have been documented as operating across Syria, \\"where at times they are alleged to be participating in house-to-house searches, identity checks, mass arrests, looting and acting as informants\\", it said.      Karen Koning AbuZayd, an American commissioner, said the committees were formed initially to defend their neighborhoods. \\"In a way, this is a move by the government to supplement its own manpower as it begins to lose some of the (regular military) manpower that it used to have,\\" she told a news conference.      Syrian Ambassador Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui dismissed the report as based on \\"partial information from untrustworthy sources\\" and accused Qatar and Turkey of \\"supporting terrorism\\" in Syria.      Related Coverage › Lebanon says world must shoulder Syrian refugee burden      \\"There is a conspiracy against Syria. Qatar has financed and armed tens of thousands of mercenaries from 30 countries. Turkey has provided the military bases and sent them into Syria on their jihad,\\" he told the Geneva forum.      \\"SECTARIAN ELEMENTS\\"      \\"We are not saying that it is a sectarian war but we call attention to sectarian elements in the present conflict,\\" Pinheiro said. Foreign fighters from more than a dozen countries are estimated to comprise less than 10 percent of the opposition forces fighting the Assad government, he said.      \\"We don't want to contribute to a paranoia that Syria is being invaded by foreign fighters. But they have a lot of skills and have been very successful in spreading acts of terror inside Syria,\\" said Pinheiro.      More than 1 million Syrian refugees have fled abroad and 2.5 million are uprooted within the country, while more than 70,000 people have been killed in the war, the United Nations says.      The war is mired in a \\"destructive stalemate, amid heavy shelling and air raids by government forces, the report said.      Both sides have committed violations against civilians, the U.N. investigators said. They are investigating about 20 cases of massacre, including three in Homs at the start of the year, despite their lack of access to the country.      They said rebel forces often execute captured Syrian soldiers and militiamen and have established detention centers in Homs and Aleppo. Rebels had also taken up positions in or near densely-populated areas, in violation of international law.      \\"There is an intensification of violations because the war is worsening. You have to look at the totality of the panorama - the murders, the arbitrary arrests and all of it,\\" said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a commission member from Thailand.      \\"Some groups are exercising or trying to exercise civilian authority without due process of law. So we have allegations for example of sentences being imposed on various people, arrested and captured soldiers and so on, without due process and then being executed, as well as some families,\\" Muntarbhorn said, noting that these were war crimes under the Geneva Convention.      The European Union and United States denounced continuing crimes and said that those responsible must be held accountable.      The U.N. investigators said that they would give a secret third list of suspects in a sealed envelope to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay with a view to future prosecutions.      Carla del Ponte, a former U.N. war crimes prosecutor who tried ex-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, is on the panel. Speaking in Italian to reporters, she said: \\"Sooner or later the International Criminal Court must be seized of the matter.      \\"I don't think that high-ranking political and military officials can be judged in their own country. We have seen, we have experience, we know that with a president of a nation, it is difficult for countries to put him on trial.\\"      (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Mark Heinrich) ||||| Few civilian areas in Syria remain untouched by the country’s two-year civil war and more than 2.5 million people have been displaced internally, according to the United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria.      “Over the past two months, there has been a dramatic erosion of areas inside Syria where civilians are able to live unaffected by the violence and destruction caused by the conflict,” the panel told the Human Rights Council in Geneva today, according to an advance copy of its presentation.      In its latest report, which covers Jan. 15 to March 3, the commission said the collapse of Syria’s economy has crippled citizens’ access to basic economic and social rights. The conflict between troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and anti-government rebels has led to shortages of fuel, electricity, water and medicine that have been compounded by international sanctions, according to the commission.      The panel is charged with investigating alleged violations of international law and all massacres in Syria. More than 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke out in March 2011 and UN High Commissioner for RefugeesAntonio Guterres said on March 6 that 1 million Syrians had fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and other countries.      “The scope of the humanitarian crisis in Syria remains of grave concern,” the commission said. “The education system in many areas is in tatters. Prices for basic necessities have increased exponentially. There has been significant damage to the country’s infrastructure.”      Hospitals Targeted      Medical personnel and hospitals have been “deliberately targeted” and are treated by both sides in the conflict as military objectives, the commission said. “Medical access has been denied on real or perceived political and sectarian grounds,” it said.      “The urgent need for a political solution cannot be overstated,” the commission said. “A failure to resolve this increasingly violent conflict will condemn Syria, the region and the millions of civilians caught in the crossfire to an unimaginably bleak future.”      The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that at least four million people are in need of assistance.

OPTIONS: (a). read the words on the pages from left to right. (b). read the words on the pages from right to left.","output":"(a) Read the words on the pages from left to right. Reading a book is a fundamental skill that is essential for acquiring knowledge, understanding concepts, and improving language skills. The process, although seemingly simple, consists of multiple steps and practices that must be adopted to get the most out of reading. Here is a detailed explanation of how to read a book, specifically choosing option (a), which is to read the words on the pages from left to right. 1. Choose a suitable book: Your reading journey begins with selecting a book that interests and engages you. Be it fiction or non-fiction, the book should cater to your preferences and reading level to ensure a positive and worthwhile experience. 2. Start with basic book information: Before diving into the actual content, familiarize yourself with the book's title, author, and any essential information like the publication date, edition, and publisher. This knowledge provides a context for your reading. 3. Read the synopsis/summary/blurb: A quick review of the book's cover or back flap will give you an idea of its content and themes. This information will set the stage for what to expect while reading. 4. Get comfortable: Find a comfortable and quiet spot with ample lighting to ensure that you can concentrate on your reading without distractions. Good posture and minimal physical discomfort allow you to read for longer periods. 5. Begin at the book's starting point: Start with the table of contents and any preface or introduction the author has included. These sections often provide valuable context, background, or insights into the book's organization and content. 6. Read from left to right and top to bottom: As you begin reading the main body of the book, follow the standard reading pattern in the English language, which is to read from left to right and from top to bottom. This directional approach ensures that you are reading the content in the intended order. 7. Follow the flow of paragraphs and sentences: A book is typically divided into chapters, which are further broken down into paragraphs. Pay attention to punctuation and sentence structure. Read sentences and paragraphs in their entirety to fully grasp the ideas, statements, or arguments being made by the writer. 8. Highlight, underline or take notes: As you read, make a note of important points, ideas, or quotes that resonate with you. This practice will make it easier to recall or refer back to key points later on. 9. Use a dictionary for unfamiliar words: If you come across an unfamiliar word, use a dictionary or the internet to look up its meaning. Understanding new vocabulary will enhance your overall understanding of the text and broaden your language skills. 10. Reflect on the content: Once you finish reading a section or chapter, take a moment to consider the author's intent, the ideas expressed, and their significance. Reflecting on the text will not only enhance your comprehension but also help in retaining the information. 11. Pace yourself: Reading a book is a personal experience, so set a pace that matches your understanding and comfort. Breaks are crucial in maintaining concentration and focus. Read for as long as you can maintain active engagement with the material. 12. Complete the book and create a summary: When you finish the entire book, it is helpful to summarize its main points, arguments, or storylines in your own words. This process reinforces the content in your memory and gives you a clear understanding of what you've learned or enjoyed from the reading experience. By following these steps and opting for option (a) to read the words on the pages from left to right, you will effectively and efficiently read a book while absorbing its content and enhancing your knowledge and language skills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has, however, cut meaningfully the politicians salaries. These policies have led to social unrest and to confrontations between several institutions, namely between the Government and the Constitutional Court. Several individualities belonging to the parties that support the government have also raised their voices against the policies that have been taken in order to try to solve the financial crisis.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The professions that bypassed receiving pension cuts in the context provided are judges, diplomats, military personnel, and police forces. In an effort to address the financial crisis, Passos Coelho announced a series of austerity measures that affected various sectors, such as raising the retirement age from 65 to 66, cutting pensions, unemployment benefits, health, education and science expenses, and abolishing the mandatory English classes in Basic Education. However, amidst these measures, the pensions of judges and diplomats were left untouched. Additionally, the retirement age for military and police forces was not raised. While Passos Coelho did cut the salaries of politicians in a meaningful manner, the preferential treatment given to certain professions led to social unrest and confrontations between government institutions, particularly between the Government and the Constitutional Court. This has also caused some individuals belonging to the parties that support the government to raise their voices against these policies, as various groups of the population have been disproportionately impacted by these austerity measures. In conclusion, despite efforts to address the financial crisis through various cutbacks and policy changes, the selective nature of the implemented measures has sparked controversy and dissent among the affected parties, with judges, diplomats, military personnel, and police forces remaining exempt from pension cuts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America, and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.

Muhammad Yunus (Bengali: muhaammd iunuus; born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and civil society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \\"for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below\\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that \\"lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty\\" and that \\"across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development\\". After his graduation, Yunus joined the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant to the economics researches of Professor Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan. Later, he was appointed lecturer in economics in Chittagong College in 1961. During that time, he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side. In 1965, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States. He obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University Graduate Program in Economic Development (GPED) in 1971. From 1969 to 1972, Yunus was assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro.  During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Yunus founded a citizen's committee and ran the Bangladesh Information Center, with other Bangladeshis in the United States, to raise support for liberation. He also published the Bangladesh Newsletter from his home in Nashville. After the War, he returned to Bangladesh and was appointed to the government's Planning Commission headed by Nurul Islam. However, he found the job boring and resigned to join Chittagong University as head of the Economics department. After observing the famine of 1974, he became involved in poverty reduction and established a rural economic program as a research project. In 1975, he developed a Nabajug (New Era) Tebhaga Khamar (three share farm) which the government adopted as the Packaged Input Programme. In order to make the project more effective, Yunus and his associates proposed the Gram Sarkar (the village government) programme. Introduced by president Ziaur Rahman in the late 1970s, the Government formed 40,392 village governments as a fourth layer of government in 2003. On 2 August 2005, in response to a petition by Bangladesh Legal Aids and Services Trust (BLAST) the High Court had declared village governments illegal and unconstitutional.  His concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries also inspired programs such as the Info lady Social Entrepreneurship Programme.

Created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller Jack Kirby, a version of the character first appeared in Venus #6 (August 1949). The modern day incarnation of Loki first appeared in Journey into Mystery #85 (October 1962). He is the adopted brother and often the enemy of the superhero Thor. With the Asgardian population other than Thor still wary of Loki, Loki revealed to his brother that he was attempting to learn more about Earth and humans, to which Thor approves. When a magpie exploded in his quarters carrying a key, it led to a chain of events where at the end, Loki was contacted by an echo of his former incarnation, who revealed he chose to sacrifice himself fighting the Void as part of a greater plan which would involve his death and return. The child Loki refused to follow this path, wanting to be his own person, and transformed the spirit of his former self into a magpie named Ikol. On returning to Earth, he witnessed Odin striking down Thor.  Odin prepared all of Asgard for an unknown battle and imprisoned Thor for attempting to protect Midgard from being scoured. Loki, who disagreed with Odin's actions, was put to work by Volstagg into cleaning the stables of Thor's goats to keep him out of trouble and danger. Using the wool of one of the goats, Loki descended into the roots of the World Tree at the advice of Ikol to ask questions from the Nornish women who live there. After receiving his answers, Loki wept but decided to turn to the imprisoned Thor for his opinion before making his final decision. Breaking into the prison by stealth, Loki asked his brother what he would do if he had to let something bad happen in order to prevent something worse from happening and what if it cost him everything. With Thor's answer, Loki decided to free one of the imprisoned Hel Wolves and bind it to him in servitude using the bridle of Thor's goats. He revealed he needed help from one more 'personage' before heading for the realm of Hela.  Having recovered Thor's hammer after he was killed and erased from memory following the war against the Serpent, Loki was able to work with the Silver Surfer to restore the hammer to its natural state and send it to Thor in the afterlife, restoring his memory and allowing him to fight his way back into the realm of the living. After Thor's return, Ikol would afterwards reveal that circumstances had been manipulated to force the young Loki to allow his former personality to subsume him and live again, his former slate wiped clean by the \\"new\\" Loki's actions. During his adventures, the young Loki had inadvertently helped create and was tied to a powerful artifact that was about to be used by Mephisto to conquer all the Hells and ultimately everything. However, if the new Loki ceased to be, the artifact would lose all power. Seeing no other option, Loki allowed Ikol to become Loki again, ceasing to be, but he warned beforehand that the Ikol personality was incapable of true change and believed this older persona would ultimately be stopped by those who always stopped him before, his brother included.

Movie title: Courage Under Fire Context: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up.

They will appeal against the decision after being found guilty of defrauding Spain of 4.1m euros from 2007 to 2009. Neither man is expected to serve any time in jail and Barcelona have launched a social media campaign urging fans to show \\"unconditional support\\". A club statement said: \\"Using the hashtag #WeAreAllLeoMessi while posting a photo or message with both hands open, the campaign is encouraging all Barça fans to express their sympathy for the greatest footballer in the world by voicing their unconditional support on social networks. \\"By making it clear that #WeAreAllMessi, we want Leo to know that he is not alone.

The pair were found guilty of using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to conceal earnings from image rights. By Andy West, Spanish football writer: The hashtag #WeAreAllLeoMessi - and its equivalents in the Spanish and Catalan languages - immediately became a hugely divisive issue in Spain. It enjoyed support from many Barca fans, who believe their club is being politically persecuted by the central Madrid government for its part in the campaign for Catalan independence from Spain. They point to the fact that Messi's case was pushed through despite one branch of the government recommending it was dropped, and that other sports stars - including former Real Madrid duo Jose Mourinho and Iker Casillas - received much lighter punishments for similar tax offences. However, the hashtag clearly leaves itself wide open to ridicule and critics have taken full advantage on social media, with a widespread attitude summed up by one tweet which read: \\"No, I haven't defrauded millions haha.\\" And even some Barca fans share that opinion, with one tweeting: \\"I'm a Cule [Barca fan] but supporting someone who has defrauded the tax office seems pathetic. #WeAreNotAllLeoMessi\\" What was that article about?","output":"This article is about Messi, a famous soccer player, and his father Jorge getting in trouble with the law.

Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out. Question: When did the narrator learn to trust himself and really own his film work? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The narrator learned to trust himself and really own his film work when they had to work independently during the project. This independence pushed them to go with their gut instincts, make decisions without seeking others' approval, and ultimately develop their aesthetic as a filmmaker, leading them to own the work they produced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Im Laufe der letzten drei Jahre haben wir eine bewusste und kritische Herangehensweise an unseren Energieverbrauch entwickelt. Durch verschiedene Maßnahmen und Verhaltensänderungen konnten wir unseren Stromverbrauch erheblich reduzieren.  Zu Beginn dieser Initiative haben wir den Stromverbrauch in unseren Gebäuden und Anlagen gründlich analysiert und mögliche Schwachstellen identifiziert. Dadurch konnten wir Potenziale für Energieeinsparungen erkennen und zielgerichtete Maßnahmen ergreifen. Zu diesen Maßnahmen gehörten unter anderem das Ersetzen veralteter und ineffizienter Geräte, die Optimierung der Gebäudeleittechnik, die Reduzierung von Standby-Verlusten und die Verbesserung von Beleuchtungssystemen. Des Weiteren haben wir das Bewusstsein für Energieeffizienz und nachhaltigen Umgang mit Ressourcen bei unseren Mitarbeitern gefördert. Dies wurde durch Schulungen, Informationsveranstaltungen und regelmäßige Kommunikation erreicht. Die Mitarbeiter wurden dazu ermutigt, aktiv an der Reduzierung des Stromverbrauchs teilzunehmen und persönlich verantwortungsvoll zu handeln. Um die kontinuierliche Verbesserung der Energieeffizienz sicherzustellen, haben wir ein internes Energiemanagementsystem implementiert und regelmäßig Audits durchgeführt. Dies ermöglichte uns, den Fortschritt zu überwachen und zusätzliche Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, falls erforderlich. Neben der Reduzierung des Stromverbrauchs haben wir uns auch bemüht, den Anteil erneuerbarer Energien in unserem Energiemix zu erhöhen. Dadurch konnten wir nicht nur unseren Energiebedarf decken, sondern auch unsere CO2-Emissionen reduzieren und einen Beitrag zum Klimaschutz leisten. Insgesamt haben diese Anstrengungen zu einer deutlichen Reduzierung des Stromverbrauchs von 25% im Vergleich zum Ausgangsniveau geführt. Dies zeigt, dass eine kritische Haltung und aktive Bemühungen zur Förderung von Energieeffizienz und nachhaltigem Ressourcenmanagement entscheidend sind, um den Verbrauch in einem solchen Umfang zu reduzieren.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that was a paratrooper during World War II?, using the article: MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The full name of the person who was a paratrooper during World War II in the story is MSgt Mike Takashima.

Given the following context:  Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / hubris).Isocrates claimed that \\"not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial\\"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: \\"was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?\\" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the court that exiled people? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Palladion. In the context provided, in 4th century BC Athens, the Palladion was the court responsible for judging suspects in cases involving the killing of slaves and determining their punishment, which could include exile. The name \\"Palladion\\" likely derives from \\"Pallas Athena,\\" the goddess associated with the city of Athens.

Negative Title: \\"Disappointing Dreams\\" - A Case of Unrealized Potential 'Disappointing Dreams' is an unfortunate case of a movie with an interesting premise, only to fall flat with its execution. With high expectations primarily due to its captivating trailer, the movie was anticipated to be a thought-provoking and sentimental exploration of personal ambition. However, the film does not live up to its promises, ultimately delivering a disjointed and underwhelming narrative. The story attempts to follow the journey of Mark, a talented pianist with dreams of making it big in the music industry. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that there is a notable lack of character development. Mark's struggles and hurdles during his journey lack the emotional weight required to garner empathy from the audience. With poor writing contributing to generic dialogues and shallow relationships with other key characters, the film fails to bring forth captivating performances from its cast. Furthermore, the editing feels rushed and uneven, constantly shifting between scenes without any cohesive transitions. This disorganization creates confusion and adds to the diminishing interest in the events surrounding Mark. There is a certain disappointment in how the captivating moments from the trailer become a sequence of fragmented scenes within the movie, and key plotlines are either abandoned or left unexplored. The director's decision to implement clichéd and formulaic storylines does not contribute to the movie's overall appeal. Predictable twists and turns, along with characters that comply with existing stereotypes, are all too familiar for avid movie enthusiasts. The film lacks the innovation that audiences crave for in today's cinematic landscape. It's disappointing to see a concept that could have potentially sparked thoughtful conversations and challenged established norms in storytelling fall victim to common clichés. The only redeeming feature of the film would be its musical score. Designed by an accomplished composer, the soundtrack does an impressive job of reflecting Mark's emotions and journey as a pianist. Unfortunately, the musical genius of the composer cannot save the movie from sinking into the abyss of mediocre filmmaking. In conclusion, 'Disappointing Dreams' is a wasted opportunity that could have been an intriguing exploration of human dreams, ambition, and the struggles that come with achieving one's goals. The poor writing, lack of character development, and rushed editing all contribute to a movie that ultimately fails to engage the audience. It is a stark reminder that a captivating trailer does not always guarantee a fulfilling cinematic experience. All in all, 'Disappointing Dreams' is a regrettable addition to the film industry and should serve as a lesson for filmmakers when crafting movies that promise profound experiences."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  In 1951, Thelonious Monk was convicted of narcotics possession after refusing to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police; a police search of the car belonging to Powell's female companion had discovered his glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet. The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who studied Celtic culture and language? ?  Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

All the given facts are expressed in natural language. Your job is to generate a story 100 to 1000 words long, that includes all the facts given as input in their order of appearance while expanding upon them to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Input: Fact1: Tomkins dispatches them to examine corpses in different areas as part of staged murders restricting pairs from interacting only allowing use of walkie talkies to report back to him, Fact2: Larry warns Megan and Kate about finding unexpected corpse of skinhead female in jumpsuit, Fact3: zombie While in pursues Kate woods alone, Fact4: Josh and Patrick see ’s movements in woods, Fact5: Rob approaches her after being bitten to death by tattoo zombie and thug zombie Output:","output":"Detective Tomkins was known as the most unorthodox, yet effective, officer on the force. He was the type of detective who could get the job done, even if it meant bending the rules a little. In a small town plagued by a series of baffling and gruesome murders, his superiors were willing to let Tomkins try anything that might stop the carnage. Tomkins had gathered a select group of officers - Larry, Megan, Kate, Josh, and Patrick - to help him with his latest plan. He intended to stage murder scenes to draw out the culprit or gather clues about their identity. Fact1: Tomkins dispatches them to examine corpses in different areas as part of staged murders, restricting pairs from interacting only allowing use of walkie-talkies to report back to him. Tomkins decided to split the team into pairs, each assigned to a specific area. Larry and Megan would cover the industrial district, Kate and Josh would investigate the residential district, while Patrick and Rob would take the dense, wooded parklands. They were to analyze the staged corpses from a distance, and if they saw anything suspicious, they were not to engage but report directly back to Tomkins via walkie-talkie. Although the team was anxious, they trusted in Tomkins' expertise and went into their assigned areas. Fact2: Larry warns Megan and Kate about finding an unexpected corpse of a skinhead female in a jumpsuit. While examining the staged scene in the industrial district, Larry stumbled upon a genuine corpse hidden amongst the chaos they'd orchestrated. The victim was a skinhead woman, clad in a jumpsuit. Larry immediately reported his findings to Tomkins, who instructed the other pairs to be on high alert. Megan and Kate, in particular, took this warning to heart, as the presence of the female corpse signified that whatever they were dealing with was far more dangerous and unpredictable than they'd initially thought. Fact3: A zombie pursues Kate in the woods, while she's alone. As the sun began to set, the officers found themselves in increasingly eerie and treacherous terrain. Kate, having wandered off from Josh to explore a suspicious-looking area, found herself deep within the woods. Suddenly, she realized she was being pursued by a grotesque and horrifying figure—a living corpse that had once been a person. The zombie relentlessly chased Kate through the darkness, its guttural moans and gnashing teeth striking terror into her heart. Fact4: Josh and Patrick see the zombie's movements in the woods. Unbeknownst to Kate, Josh had noticed her absence and had called in Patrick for backup. They scoured the woods in search of their colleague, knowing that something dreadful was afoot. As they searched, they caught sight of the staggering and unnatural movements of the zombie hunting Kate. With growing panic, they realized that their team had stumbled upon something far more dangerous and otherworldly than they could have ever anticipated—a supernatural force that threatened not only the lives of the townspeople but their own as well. Fact5: Rob approaches Kate after being bitten to death by the tattooed zombie and thug zombie. In a moment of desperation, Kate tripped and fell, the menacing figure looming over her. It was then that Rob appeared, limping and bloodied, only to reveal that he had fallen victim to a horrifying pair of zombies—one adorned with tattoos, the other a thug-like monster. Despite being all but torn apart, Rob mustered the strength to fight off the creature that threatened Kate's life. Unfortunately, his brave actions came at the ultimate cost. As his life ebbed away, Rob transformed into a monstrous shell of his former self, leaving Kate and their fellow officers to confront an enemy that was as deadly as it was unstoppable. In the end, it was up to Tomkins and his team to face their greatest fears, not just for the sake of the town, but for each other. The stakes were high, and the question remained: how could they fight an enemy that was both relentless and terrifyingly inhuman? Only time would tell if they could succeed in banishing the darkness that had invaded their once-peaceful lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minutes from the Fed's meeting on 28-29 July show one policymaker was ready to vote for a rate rise at the meeting. However, other policymakers remained concerned that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices. The Fed's key interest rate has been kept near zero since December 2008. There has been speculation that the Fed will raise rates at its meeting in September, and last month Fed chair Janet Yellen said she thought a rate rise this year was likely. In assessing the strength of the US economy, the Fed has been keeping an eye on the US jobs market - which has seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.3%. However, inflation is still below the Fed's target of 2%. The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting said: \\"Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.\\" The committee noted that the labour market \\"had continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment\\". However, when assessing inflation, it said that \\"some members continued to see downside risks to inflation from the possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in commodity prices\\". The FOMC said it would continue to monitor inflation \\"closely, with almost all members indicating that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labour market conditions had firmed enough for them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would return to the committee's longer-run objective over the medium term\\". Inflation figures released earlier on Wednesday showed that consumer prices rose by 0.1% in July, and were 0.2% higher from a year ago. So-called core inflation, which ignores changes in food and energy prices, also rose 0.1% last month, but was up 1.8% over the year. The committee also cited China as a potential problem, saying that a \\"material slowdown\\" in the Chinese economy could affect the US economic outlook. The FOMC's meeting came before last week's action by China to weaken its currency. Following the release of the Fed's minutes, US stocks rallied briefly but then fell back, while the dollar weakened on the currency markets. \\"The Fed minutes don't rule out a September rate hike but they are certainly saying they want more evidence on the data,\\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, told Reuters. Summary:","output":"The Federal Reserve remains cautious about raising interest rates due to concerns that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices, while also considering the potential impact of a \\"material slowdown\\" in the Chinese economy on the U.S. outlook."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve this equation, we can follow these steps: 1. Isolate the term with 'h' on one side of the equation. In this case, we want to get 'h' by itself.  -125h - 3407 = -5782 2. First, we'll move the constant term '-3407' from the left side to the right side of the equation by adding '3407' to both sides: -125h - 3407 + 3407 = -5782 + 3407 -125h = -2375 3. Now, to isolate 'h', we'll divide the equation by the coefficient of 'h', which is '-125': -125h / (-125) = -2375 / (-125) h = 19 So the solution to the equation -125*h - 3407 = -5782 is h = 19."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Q: Temperature and pressure affect changes in phases or states of what?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Most substances have three distinct phases: gas, liquid, and solid. Phase changes among the various phases of matter depend on temperature and pressure. The existence of the three phases with respect to pressure and temperature can be described in a phase diagram. Two phases coexist (i. , they are in thermal equilibrium) at a set of pressures and temperatures. These are described as a line on a phase diagram. The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram. A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor. Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone. Dalton’s law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all of the gases present.
