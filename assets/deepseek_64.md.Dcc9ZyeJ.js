I expected the tool to be flimsy, but it is thicker and stronger that I anticipated. The knife edge is not sharp, but I have not tried to sharpen it. Seems pretty useful for the 2 that I spent on it. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given product review, it can be inferred that the overall sentiment leans towards being positive. The title, \\"Random Multitool Review,\\" does not provide any immediate indication about the reviewer's opinion on the product. However, the content of the review sheds more light on their perspective. The reviewer states that they would not consider the multitool as having 11 tools as advertised, but instead sees it as having 10. Despite this, they still mention that \\"10 is still good,\\" which shows that the reviewer does not rate the product negatively due to the difference in the number of tools. Furthermore, the reviewer expresses their surprise at the build quality of the product, as they initially expected it to be flimsy. The fact that it is \\"thicker and stronger\\" than expected serves as a positive point in favor of the product. The only concern raised is regarding the sharpness of the knife edge, but the reviewer has not attempted to sharpen it, possibly implying that the issue isn't significant enough for the reviewer to take action. Lastly, the reviewer declares that the multitool seems \\"pretty useful\\" for the price they paid for it (2). From this statement, it can be deduced that the reviewer found the purchase to be a decent investment, further validating the generally positive sentiment in the review. Taking all of these points into consideration, the overall conclusion from this product review is positive. The reviewer acknowledges some minor shortcomings but still perceives the multitool to be useful and valuable for the price."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His furniture designs were considered Scandinavian Modern. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a \\"total work of art\\"; whereby he  together with his first wife Aino Aalto  would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware.

Joseph had to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes, because  Available choices: a. Joseph was playing in the mud.. b. Benjamin was playing in the mud..","output":"Benjamin was playing in the mud.  Children often enjoy the simple pleasures of life that adults often overlook or simply disregard due to the complications they often bring. One of these simple pleasures is running amok in the great outdoors after a rain shower, when the ground is ripe and wet, and little puddles of water form on every depression on the terrain. Benjamin, just like any other child his age, had recently discovered this muddy haven and the adventures it had to offer.  Every other day, when the sky was pouring, and most parents would keep their children indoors out of fear they'd catch a cold, Benjamin's house was different. His parents, who believed in the joy and learning that nature exploration could bring, allowed him to go out and experience the world, even in its messiest forms. Therefore, on a Saturday morning, when it had been raining cats and dogs the night before, Benjamin woke up eager and enthusiastic, looking forward to splashing through the accumulated showers and playing in the mud puddles. Donned in his favorite pair of boots, Benjamin made his way outside. The fresh smell of rain and earth filling his lungs, he started to run and jump around, splashing in puddles and rolling in the mud. His laughter echoing through the quiet Saturday morning, as he sculpted the mud into whatever his creative mind could conjure up. By the afternoon, however, his clothes were soiled with mud stains. His shirt, once a vibrant red, was now a dull brown, his shorts had patterns that made him look like a miniature soldier in camouflage, and his boots painted with splatters of mud. And as much as he enjoyed being in the mud, the cleanup afterwards was a task his mother staunchly refused to do stating the muddy clothes were a result of his adventure and he should take responsibility for them. This is where Benjamin relied on his older brother, Joseph, to help him out. Seeing his younger brother, wide-eyed and hoping he'd help, Joseph couldn't resist but assist him with his muddy dilemma. Joseph needed to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes because detergent and cold water just wouldn't do the trick. Boiling hot water was needed to break down the grime and muddy streaks that had encrusted his younger brother's clothes. Joseph filled up a large pot with water and set it to boil on the stove. While they waited for the water to heat up, they separated Benjamin's clothes into small piles based on color. Once the water began bubbling, he carefully submerged Benjamin’s clothes into the pot, taking care not to scorch himself with the hot water. He added a generous amount of soap to ensure a deep clean and stirred the clothes gently with a wooden stick. As Joseph cleaned the clothes, Benjamin sat by his side. Seeing his older brother doing his part made Benjamin realize that play and fun were enjoyable, but they also came with responsibilities all their own. This muddy adventure, thus, was not just a day of fun for Benjamin but was also a day of learning about responsibility and consequences of actions. His brother had managed to make the chore fun, teaching and guiding him, strengthening their bond, through something as simple as cleaning his soiled clothes. The day ended not with the setting sun or clean clothes hanging to dry, but two brothers smiling and laughing together, a bond strengthened, and a lesson well-learnt. So, Joseph had to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes, not only because Benjamin was playing in the mud, but also because this simple act had greater lessons to teach about responsibility, consequences, and the bond of brotherhood."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 .

De Ruyter was born on 24 March 1607 in Vlissingen, Netherlands, as the son of beer porter Adriaen Michielszoon and Aagje Jansdochter. Little is known about De Ruyter's early life, but he probably became a sailor at the age of 11. It is said that once, when he was a child, he climbed up ladders to get to the roof of his home town's church. Not knowing that De Ruyter was there, some workers then removed the ladders. In July 1655, De Ruyter took command of a squadron of eight (of which the Tijdverdrijf [Pastime] was his flagship) and set out for the Mediterranean with 55 merchantmen in convoy. His orders were to protect Dutch trade. Meeting an English fleet under Robert Blake along the way, he managed to avoid an incident. Operating off the Barbary Coast, he captured several infamous corsairs. After negotiating a peace agreement with Sale, De Ruyter returned home May 1656.  The same month, the States General, becoming ever more wary of Swedish King Charles X and his expansion plans, decided to intervene in the Northern Wars by sending a fleet to the Baltic Sea. The Swedes controlled this area after Charles had invaded Poland and made himself king there. De Ruyter once again embarked aboard the Tijdverdrijf, arriving at the Oresund 8 June; there he waited for Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to arrive. After Obdam had assumed command, De Ruyter and the Dutch fleet sailed to relieve the besieged city of Danzig/Gdansk on 27 July, without any bloodshed. Peace was signed a month later. Before leaving the Baltic, De Ruyter and other flag officers were granted an audience by Frederick III of Denmark. De Ruyter took a liking to the Danish king, who later became a friend.  In 1658, the States General, on the advice of a leading member (Cornelis de Graeff, one of the mayors of Amsterdam), decided to once again send a fleet to the Baltic Sea to protect the important Baltic trade and to aid the Danes against Swedish aggression, which continued despite a peace settlement. In accordance with the States' balance-of-power political approach, a fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam was sent, without De Ruyter, who at the time was blockading Lisbon. On 8 November, a bloody melee took place, the Battle of the Sound, which resulted in a Dutch victory, relieving Copenhagen. Still the Swedes were far from defeated and the States decided to continue their support. De Ruyter took command of a new expeditionary fleet and managed to liberate Nyborg in 1659. For this, he was knighted by King Frederick III of Denmark From 1661 until 1663, de Ruyter did convoy duty in the Mediterranean.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension","output":"The phrase \\"maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension\\" would generally be considered negative due to several factors in the phrasing and the sentiment conveyed. To dissect this phrase, let's break it down into its primary components and analyze their meanings: 1. Maintaining consciousness - The process of holding onto awareness, staying conscious, or staying awake. On its own, this might be viewed neutrally, but it suggests some effort or struggle. 2. Just long enough - This implies that the consciousness is being held onto for the bare minimum amount of time required to perform a particular act. It suggests that the individual is not interested or motivated to be engaged any longer than necessary. This can impart a negative tone. 3. Achieve - While this word can have a positive connotation, as it often refers to accomplishment or the attainment of a goal, it depends on the context and the object of achievement. In this case, the goal itself may not be desirable (as described below). 4. Callow - An adjective referring to someone being inexperienced, immature, or lacking sophistication. This is generally a negative term, as it underscores a lack of growth or maturity and may imply naivety or superficiality in the individual. 5. Pretension - A noun that represents the act of pretending to have a greater importance, intellect, or skill than one actually possesses, often accompanied by a desire to appear more impressive to others. Pretension is generally viewed negatively, as it denotes a falsity or a lack of authenticity and can be seen as an attempt to manipulate perceptions. By combining these elements, the phrase \\"maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension\\" suggests that the individual, possibly reluctantly or unenthusiastically, puts forth just enough effort to appear superficially knowledgeable or sophisticated. This deceptive action further emphasizes their immaturity or lack of experience, making the overall sentiment of the phrase negative. In conclusion, the given phrase would likely be considered negative by most as it portrays the individual in a less-than-admirable light while highlighting their effort to project a facade of sophistication that they may not have yet earned or developed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: A Space Odyssey. Miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible.  The movie traces two characters, a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (John Leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. Diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but Diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end.  There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek. Characters contemplate on why they're in the Ice Age, while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era. Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: \`All the great guys are never around. The sensitive ones get eaten.' Throwaway lines galore, whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch. Also, food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as \`good eating.'  The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas, while the children will delight in their antics, the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents. There is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought.  and a hint : One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.  Please answer this question : Which region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss? Answer:","output":"The region with fewer plants having an ability to come up with a strategy to minimize water loss would be the eastern region of Austria, which is exposed to a wet climate and has thriving vegetation. This is because the plants in this region have not experienced the same selective pressures for drought adaptation as those in the western region, which has been exposed to drought. The study by Tombesi et al. revealed that plants that have been consistently exposed to drought are able to develop a \\"memory\\" that allows them to adapt their strategies to minimize water loss and improve their overall survival in water-scarce environments. These adaptations include changes in the regulation of their stomata and the hydraulic safety margin. Stomata are tiny pores on a plant's leaves that are responsible for gas exchange necessary for photosynthesis and respiration. The opening and closing of these pores can regulate transpiration, the process of water evaporating from the plant's leaves, and thus manage the plant's overall water usage. In the western region of Austria, where plants experience a drier climate and drought conditions, they would have undergone selective pressures in order to develop and maintain these water-saving adaptations, including changes in stomatal regulation and transpiration rate. This allows them to be more efficient in water usage and better survive in less-than-ideal environmental conditions. On the contrary, plants in the eastern region, where a wetter climate prevails, would not have encountered the same selective pressures for drought survival. As a result, they are less likely to have developed such adaptive strategies for minimizing water loss and using water efficiently. Consequently, the eastern region of Austria has fewer plants with the ability to come up with strategies to minimize water loss as compared to the western region, which is more prone to drought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Answer the following question: Information:  - Christiansborg Palace is a palace and government building on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the seat of the Danish Parliament (\\"\\"), the Danish Prime Minister's Office and the Supreme Court of Denmark. Also, several parts of the palace are used by the Danish monarch, including the Royal Reception Rooms, the Palace Chapel and the Royal Stables.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - The Folketing (; lit. \\"the people's thing\\"), also known as the Danish Parliament in English, is the unicameral national parliament (legislature) of the Kingdom of Denmark. Established in 1849, until 1953 the Folketing was the lower house of a bicameral parliament, called the Rigsdag; the upper house was the Landsting. It meets in Christiansborg Palace, on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - General elections were held in Denmark on 10 January 1984 , after the opposition voted against the government 's state budget bill . Although the Social Democratic Party remained the largest in the Folketing with 56 of the 179 seats , the Conservative People 's Party achieved its best - ever result , gaining 16 seats . The coalition partners Venstre and the Christian People 's Party also increased their representation , although the fourth government party , the Centre Democrats , lost seven of their 15 seats . Overall the coalition won three more seats , and Poul Schlüter continued as Prime Minister Voter turnout was 88.4 % in Denmark proper , 61.0 % in the Faroe Islands and 63.9 % in Greenland .  - Poul Holmskov Schlüter (3 April 1929) is a Danish politician, who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 1982 to 1993. He was the first member of the Conservative People's Party to become Prime Minister, as well as the first conservative to hold the office since 1901.  - The Prime Minister of Denmark (literally \\"Minister of State\\") is the head of government in the Kingdom of Denmark. Before the creation of the modern office, Denmark did not initially have a head of government separate from its head of state, namely the Monarch, in whom the executive authority was vested. The Constitution of 1849 established a constitutional monarchy by limiting the powers of the Monarch and creating the office of . The inaugural holder of the office was Adam Wilhelm Moltke.    What is the relationship between 'danish general election' and 'prime minister of denmark'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between the 'Danish general election' and the 'Prime Minister of Denmark' is that the general election is a democratic process in which the citizens of Denmark vote to elect members of the Danish Parliament (Folketing). Based on the outcome of the general election, a Prime Minister is then appointed as the head of the government in the Kingdom of Denmark. In the context provided, the 1984 Danish general election resulted in the Social Democratic Party remaining the largest party in the Folketing, but the Conservative People's Party, led by Poul Schlüter, gained significant seats. The coalition, including Schlüter's party, won additional seats, allowing Poul Schlüter to continue as the Prime Minister of Denmark. In summary, the Danish general election determines the composition of the Danish Parliament, which directly influences the appointment of the Prime Minister of Denmark."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

September 25, 2011 at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio (Blacked Out) Playing versus the San Francisco 49ers for the first time since 2003, the Bengals lost 13-8 with the smallest crowd for a Bengals home opener since 1981. Before the game, the team activated Simpson, who was previously injured. The only score in the first half was when Nugent kicked a 22-yard field goal in the first quarter. It took until 3 minutes left in the third quarter for another score, when 49ers' kicker David Akers tied the game with a field goal. The Bengals' final possession ended when 49ers' Reggie Smith intercepted Dalton's pass with 1:45 left in the game. It was Dalton's first performance where his passer rating was below 100; this game he completed 17 of 32 passes for 157 yards and a rating of 40.8. Coach Lewis claimed the lack of third-down conversions (1-10) were the main reason why the team lost, saying that \\"We are not converting the third downs or converting in the red zone, and we are not coming away with touchdowns.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who left his skeleton in his will for the Grainger Museum?, using the article: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to  visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when  he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after  further surgery  he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital  went well, but his conducting in the afternoon  was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\".  Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie  that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.  His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record  attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.

Input: Abstract: Heart Failure (HF) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. beta adrenergic receptors (betaAR) are the primary pathway through which cardiac function is influenced. Chronic beta(1)AR activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of HF and betaAR blockade improves survival in left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Common functional polymorphisms in beta adrenergic receptor genes (ADRB) have been associated with HF phenotypes, and with pharmacogenetic interaction with beta adrenergic receptor blockers (beta blockers). However, these associations have not been consistently replicated. The evidence for ADRB variant involvement in pathogenesis, progression and response to beta blockers in HF is reviewed. In addition, a meta-analysis of three studies analysing the effect of ADRB1 Arg389Gly polymorphism on left ventricular remodelling with the use of beta blockers, demonstrating a 5% improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in Arg389 homozygotes, is presented. There is now accumulating molecular evidence for a different functional response to beta blockers associated with this polymorphism. In the future, confirmed genotypic associations may enable patients to be identified who are either at greater risk of developing HF, whose HF may rapidly progress, or who are unlikely to benefit from beta blockers, and such patients may benefit from targeted aggressive therapy..

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided consists of specific information about Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport. This airport, which is located in the municipality of Paracuellos de Jarama, has an elevation of 610.0 meters above sea level. In order to better understand this data, let's break down each component: 1. Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport: This is the primary international airport serving Madrid, Spain. Its four passenger terminals cover a total area of approximately 3,050 hectares (12 square miles), making it the largest airport in Europe in terms of physical size. 2. Location (Paracuellos de Jarama): Paracuellos de Jarama is a municipality situated in the region of Madrid. Specifically, it is located northeast of the metropolitan area. The proximity of Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport to the city makes it easily accessible for travelers seeking to visit or depart from Madrid. The airport also serves as a major hub for both Spanish and international airlines, connecting passengers worldwide. 3. ElevationAboveTheSeaLevel (610.0 meters): The elevation of Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport is 610 meters (2,001 feet) above sea level. This value is an important consideration for pilots and air traffic controllers, as higher altitudes can have an impact on aircraft performance and weather conditions. However, considering that the global average elevation of airports is approximately 1,334 feet, Madrid-Barajas's elevation is relatively moderate and should not lead to significant operational challenges. In summary, the data provided describes Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport, a prominent international airport in Spain. Situated within the municipality of Paracuellos de Jarama and easily accessible from the city of Madrid, it serves as a crucial hub for both domestic and international travel. The airport's elevation of 610 meters above sea level is a factor to take into account for aviation professionals and travelers alike, yet it is unlikely to cause significant difficulties when compared to other airports around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery. Yes, said Richard Brilla, director of the new facility, \\"but the donuts are a lot more costly here.\\" Each wafer, holding hundreds of chips, is worth 6,000 to 10,000 apiece, depending on what insulation, circuitry and materials are used.

After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If you want to make a bridge that can sustain large amounts of weight, you will need to use the best materials. As stated above, epoxy is the strongest bonding agent you can use. Also, you want to make sure you have plenty of pasta on-hand to make the necessary reinforcements to your bridge. Consider the benefits and disadvantages of various types of pasta.Rounded spaghetti noodles may be better for some parts of your bridge while flattened noodles, like linguine, may be better for other parts. The purpose of building a spaghetti bridge is to apply the theoretical principles of engineering to a real-life construction project. As such, how you design the bridge deeply impacts the overall strength of the bridge. Some tips for building a stronger bridge include:  Use triangular rather than rectangular trusses. Build the roadbed with multiple layers of pasta. You should leave the middle layer of your pasta roadbed unglued. Some flexibility in the pasta helps to redistribute weight across your bridge. The longer the gap a bridge has to span, the harder it will be to redistribute the weight from one area across the entire bridge. So, if it is up to you, making a shorter bridge will help your bridge sustain more weight. There is a relationship between the weight and strength of your bridge. Adding more pasta to your bridge during construction, when properly built, should add strength, but also adds more weight. The heavier your bridge is, the more likely it is that it will collapse when extra weight is applied. So, make sure you account for the weight of your bridge when designing your bridge. Summary:","output":"To make a strong bridge with pasta, we need to use the best materials like epoxy and different types of pasta. Building a spaghetti bridge helps us learn about real-life construction. To make our bridge stronger, we can use triangle shapes, different layers of pasta, and make it shorter if we can. But we should remember, adding more pasta makes the bridge heavy, which may make it break when we put more weight on it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The three schools involved in the debate at the beginning of the 20th century were Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When I was seven my father gave me a Timex, my first watch. I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are now classified as\\"investments\\" . A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS350, 000, while the 1960s Rolexes have gone from PS15, 000 to PS30, 000 plus in a year.

Crowds began to thin out as it became apparent that the clash of two titans, Aguero and Sanchez, coupled with their respective powerhouse teams, Manchester City and Arsenal, had produced a tangible effect on the trajectory of the league. A palpable sense of urgency and tension pervaded the atmosphere throughout the stadium, with both sides acutely aware of what was at stake.  As the match progressed, each team displayed remarkable determination and vigour, vying for control over the midfield – the epicenter of the battle. It was a true showcase of football prowess, as world-class athletes darted across the pitch, weaving expertly in and out of intricate plays, leaving spectators in awe. The physicality of the English game was on full display, with players meeting challenges head-on, refusing to back down from the confrontation. Naturally, the fans in each corner of the stadium hung on each tantalizing moment of play, collectively holding their breath as each chance arose and was either seized or thwarted. The supporters' vividly adorned scarves and banners were a testament to the fierce loyalty and unwavering passion that both clubs had elicited in their devoted fanbase. And yet, as the match wore on without either side managing to claim dominance, the tension morphed into desperation. The clock continued to tick down mercilessly, the window of opportunity for a decisive goal narrowing with each passing minute. Full-blooded tackles began to feel more frantic than calculated, with players throwing themselves recklessly into the fray in a bid to snatch the all-important lead. In the end, it seemed that the high stakes of the match had created an atmosphere of such intensity and pressure that neither team could quite tip the scales in their favor. Though the game could well have been a turning point for the title race, its resolution left the path ahead even more uncertain and competitive. As the final whistle sounded, a somber sense of resignation settled over the Etihad.

Given the question: Information:  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489).  - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current.  - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack.  - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others .  - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.  - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia.  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\".    What is the relationship between 'masters of the hemisphere ' and 'kindercore records'? The answer is:","output":"'Masters of the Hemisphere' is a band that was signed to 'Kindercore Records'.

His characters are well developed, and his plots draw you in and, before you know it, you're hooked. Although I don't play golf (and am abysmal even at miniature golf), I decided to read this book simply because I love Merullo's ability to weave a good tale. While there is unquestionably a lot of golf lingo in the book, I either asked people in the know what the terms meant, or I let the words just fly over my head and focused on the general storyline instead. So, despite golf being the primary focus of the book, I enjoyed the characters and the tale (almost) as much as the other Merullo books I've read.

Newly spotlighted is the reprobate incident wherein hackers targeted Milly Dowler, a murdered girl. The event has been labeled as a \\"cowardly and shocking\\" offense by outraged spokesperson Grant.  Milly Dowler, tragically taken before her prime, faced more than just a physical intrusion. In an act disturbingly void of conscience, journalists managed to hack into her phone even before her body was discovered. The digital invasion not only stung her memory but also brings forth a critical perspective on the ethics in media. Reported by Milly Dowler's mother and still trembling with grief, the incident had given her a false glimmer of hope as she narrated. The emotional strain and psychological torment she faced, compounded by the hacking into her daughter's phone, underline the harm inflicted by such acts well beyond the cyber realm. However, the scope of this act extends beyond merely a single isolated incident. Police investigations revealed a chilling reality. It was reported that up to 5,800 people were potential victims of phone hacking. This statistic raises grave concern over the security of individuals in the evolving digital framework and urges us to question the magnitude of safekeeping and privacy. A wave of revulsion has surged through society due to this unethical practice. Public figures like Grant fuel the outcry against these \\"cowardly and shocking\\" crimes, amplifying the understated gravity of digital security and privacy in our increasingly connected world.

Craig, being a naturally curious and outgoing individual, enjoyed the opportunities that school provided for socializing, exploring new subjects, and engaging in extracurricular activities. He thrived in the structured environment, always eager to learn and grow with his classmates. Step 1: Analyze the given text and see the differences between the two characters. Step 2: Highlight the positive aspects for Craig. On the other hand, Robert found school to be a much more challenging and isolating place. With a shy and introverted personality, Robert struggled to connect with his peers and make new friends. He also had a difficult time grasping certain subjects, which caused him to feel overwhelmed and discouraged. Step 3: Contrast Robert's experience to Craig's by pointing out his struggles and challenges. For Craig, every day at school was an opportunity to make the most of new experiences, such as being a part of the school's debate team, participating in sports activities, and taking part in various academic projects with his classmates. These activities allowed him to build a strong network of friends and develop leadership skills. Step 4: Provide examples of Craig's positive school experience and achievements. Robert, however, often felt lost and invisible in the bustling hallways and classrooms. While he excelled in areas such as art and music, the academic pressure and social demands of the school system made him question his own abilities and value. His self-esteem plummeted as he tried to navigate a world that seemed designed for extroverted learners like Craig. Step 5: Delve deeper into Robert's struggles by adding a personal conflict (self-esteem issues) and recognizing his talents (art and music). Despite their contrasting experiences in school, both Craig and Robert had their own unique strengths and areas where they could excel. Their journeys through the school system served as a testament to the varying needs and abilities of every student, reminding us that the educational experience can be both rewarding and challenging, depending on the individual's perspective and circumstances.

On Tuesday a U.S. appeals court was set to hear arguments in a legal effort to strike down Obama's plan as unconstitutional.Romney will speak from the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center in Ann Arbor, returning to the state where his father served as governor and where he kicked off his 2008 White House campaign four years ago.Romney's campaign listed his five principles for reform:--Restore to the states the responsibility and resources to care for their poor, uninsured, and chronically ill.--Give a tax deduction to those who buy their own health insurance, just like those who buy it through their employers.--Streamline the federal regulation of healthcare.--Reduce the influence of lawsuits on medical practice and costs.--Make healthcare more like a consumer market and less like a government program.Romney has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for another presidential campaign, but publicly says he is still in an exploratory phase.michael.memoli@latimes.com ||||| WASHINGTON – Mitt Romney is planning a major address on Thursday to discuss health care, in what could become a defining moment of his emerging presidential bid as he gives a prominent answer to one of his biggest perceived shortcomings.      Romney is planning to outline his plan to repeal President Obama’s health care plan and replace it with something else. The address will be given in Ann Arbor, Mich., at the University of Michigan’s Cardiovascular Center.      It will be Romney’s first major policy speech, and comes amid increasing activity in his campaign. Over the next few weeks, he is also planning to travel to Las Vegas to raise money, as well as to two early primary states, Iowa and South Carolina.      Health care has been the primary problem for Romney’s early campaign, and even his supporters have said they wanted him to address it in a prominent way. His speech on Thursday will be aimed at both winning over his critics and bolstering his supporters.      The health care plan that Romney signed as governor of Massachusetts has provided a template for the national plan signed by President Obama last year. With Republicans focused on attacking Obama’s plan, many have raised questions over whether Romney would be the right advocate for their party.      Romney has defended the Bay State plan, while saying he would repeal Obama’s national overhaul, saying it unfairly mandates a one-size-fits-all system on each state.      His campaign today provided a brief outline of his health care approach, including:      • Restore to the states the responsibility and resources to care for their poor, uninsured, and chronically ill.      • Give a tax deduction to those who buy their own health insurance, just like those who buy it through their employers.      • Streamline the federal regulation of healthcare.      • Reduce the influence of lawsuits on medical practice and costs.      • Make healthcare more like a consumer market and less like a government program.

From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels  thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear. Options: A large head B strong legs C body size D flexible neck Answer: D flexible neck Question: A:","output":"What adaptation allows owls to better track their prey by turning their heads nearly upside down and 270 degrees around? A) A large head B) Strong legs C) Body size D) Flexible neck"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Movie title: Tender Mercies Movie plot: Mac Sledge (Robert Duvall), a washed up, alcoholic country singer, awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories.Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After some time passes, he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the hotel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and chosen an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about Mac and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott (Betty Buckley), a country music star who is performing nearby.After the story is printed, the neighborhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local countrywestern band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).Mac returns home to a jealous Rosa Lee and assures her he no longer has feelings for Dixie, who he describes as \\"poison\\" to him. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie's urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie \\"Tender Mercies,\\" Mac's ex-wife is Dixie Scott, portrayed by Betty Buckley. Dixie is a country music star who is still actively performing in the industry while Mac has left his past behind. Mac and Dixie's relationship is identified as a difficult one, where he refers to her as \\"poison\\" to him. Furthermore, Dixie warns Mac to stay away from their daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin), indicating the ongoing tension and unresolved issues between them. In the context of considering an investment in a film, Mac's complicated relationship with his ex-wife Dixie is highly significant. It adds a layer of depth and conflict to the character of Mac, and to the overall plot. The fact that Dixie is depicted as a currently thriving country music star juxtaposes with Mac's transformed life as a reformed alcoholic living with his new wife, Rosa Lee. These contrasting paths that both characters have taken since their separation provide a rich source of tension and dramatic conflict, which could potentially make this film more appealing to audiences and critics. As Dixie is a prominent character in the film and key to understanding Mac's past, the portrayal of her character could significantly impact the film's success. Therefore, if you're considering investing in this film, you should pay close attention to who is cast in this role and how this character is approached by the director and screenwriter. In addition, the character of Dixie provides a bridge between Mac's past and present life, and her introduction into the story evokes feelings of intrigue, tension, and suspense amongst viewers. It offers an insight into Mac's depth as a character, as well as the impact of his past on his present life. Therefore, a well-developed and well-portrayed Dixie character could strengthen the film's narrative and overall emotional impact. For investing in this proposed film, think about not just the characters and the plot, but also other factors like the creative team (their past work, reputation, and artistic vision), the potential audience for this type of story, marketing and distribution plans, and the financial projections and potential return on investment. It often helps to consult with experts in film finance and production, ideally those with experience in the genre or type of film in question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer: Who was the first American in space","output":"The first American in space was astronaut Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. Born on November 18, 1923, in East Derry, New Hampshire, Shepard made history on May 5, 1961, when he flew aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3 (also known as Freedom 7) spacecraft during the Mercury Program. His flight marked a significant milestone in the United States' journey toward human space exploration. Shepard's spaceflight came nearly a month after Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to venture into space, on April 12, 1961. The USSR's achievement of sending a man to space ignited fierce competition between the two countries during the Cold War era, fueling the well-known space race. Before becoming an astronaut, Shepard attended the United States Naval Academy and served as a naval aviator. He later became a test pilot, showcasing exceptional flying skills. In 1959, he was selected by NASA as part of its first group of astronauts, named the Mercury Seven. The group included other notable astronauts such as John Glenn and Virgil \\"Gus\\" Grissom. Alan Shepard's historic flight aboard Freedom 7 lasted just over 15 minutes and reached a maximum altitude of 116 miles (187 kilometers). The spacecraft followed a suborbital trajectory rather than placing him into orbit around Earth. During the flight, Shepard experienced brief weightlessness and tested the manual control of the spacecraft, proving that humans could indeed function effectively in the space environment. The successful mission made Alan Shepard a national hero and an invaluable icon in the history of American space exploration. He went on to fly again in 1971 during NASA's Apollo 14 mission, becoming the fifth person to walk on the moon. Shepard retired from NASA in 1974 with the rank of rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. He passed away on July 21, 1998, at the age of 74. Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr.'s pioneering role in American space history, from his status as the first American astronaut in space to his lunar expedition, remains an inspiring testament to human ambition and the power of exploration in expanding our understanding of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

This shows that Jake started caring for the snake and taking responsibility for its well-being. - It soon became Jake's official pet. This statement explicitly contradicts the hypothesis because it indicates that the snake is considered as Jake's official pet. - He (Jake) kept it (the snake) for many years. This reinforces the idea that the snake was Jake's official pet, as he cared for it long term and took responsibility for it. Since the paragraph states that the snake became Jake's official pet, the hypothesis \\"Jake only has unofficial pets\\" is not true. The passage clearly indicates that Jake took care of the snake and considered it his official pet for many years, which directly contradicts the statement made in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Every three years, under King Deucalion's order, eight youths are taken from the village to the capital of the Minos' Empire. There, they are placed in an underground labyrinth to be sacrifices to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, son of Cyrnan, the village chieftain, is haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice. A leprous prophetess tells him that Fion is still alive in the labyrinth. Against his father's wishes, he replaces one of the sacrifices and is taken to the Minos Empire capitol. Other captives are Danu (Theo's best friend), Morna (Danu's love interest), Tyro (who initially resents Theo because of his standing), Didi (Tyro's love interest), Vena, Ziko and Nan. After the group are dropped into the labyrinth, the Minotaur immediately begins hunting them and kills Nan. The survivors are approached by Queen Raphaella, Deucalion's sister and unwilling lover, who offers them a way out. Vena does not believe her, and when she attempts to leave the group, the Minotaur impales her with its horn. The rest of the group evade the Minotaur and, led by Raphaella, they get to a chamber at the center of the labyrinth. There, the monster lies asleep on its victims's remains, and a heavy wooden door leads out of the labyrinth. Raphaella had arranged for her servant Ramaya to open the door from the other side, but Deucalion catches the servant and has her executed. Desperate, the group attempt to break down the door. The noise wakes the Minotaur, which kills Ziko and splits up the group. Theo, Danu, and Morna encounter Turag, a villager from a previous offering. Turag has managed to elude the Minotaur thus far, but has become slightly insane over the years. Looking at the map of the labyrinth Turag has drawn, Theo learns of Fion's supposed location and goes off alone to find her.

Ask a question about Egypt.","output":"What were the primary factors that led to the success and longevity of the ancient Egyptian civilization? Ancient Egypt is one of the most fascinating and enduring civilizations in history, and its success and longevity can be attributed to various factors. The following elements played a significant role in shaping the ancient Egyptian civilization, allowing it to thrive culturally, socially, and economically for centuries: 1. Geography and Natural Resources: Egypt benefitted greatly from its strategic location along the Nile River, which provided fertile land, a steady water supply, and abundant resources like papyrus (used for writing) and fish (used for food). The Nile also made travel and communication much more accessible, allowing for easier dissemination of ideas, goods, and people. The surrounding deserts and seas provided natural barriers for protection against foreign invasions, granting the civilization relative peace and stability. 2. Agriculture: Ancient Egyptians were able to harness the annual Nile floods to create and sustain some of the most fertile agricultural land in the ancient world. Sophisticated irrigation and crop rotation systems enabled them to grow various crops, including wheat and barley (used for bread and beer), flax (used for clothing), and fruits and vegetables (used for sustenance). This agricultural abundance supported a large population and helped fuel economic growth. 3. Centralized Government: Pharaohs, who were considered to be both divine rulers and political leaders, governed ancient Egypt. This centralized system allowed for efficient management of resources, infrastructure development, and coordination of large-scale projects like the immense temples and pyramids. The bureaucracy also promoted stability and the smooth transition of power from one dynasty to another. 4. Religion: The belief system of ancient Egypt was deeply embedded in its culture and was intricately connected with the government. The pharaoh and the priest class were responsible for maintaining harmony and balance by performing religious rituals and ceremonies. This unity of religion and state contributed to the overall stability and organization of the civilization. 5. Advanced Architecture and Engineering: Ancient Egyptians built impressive structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Temple of Karnak, and the Sphinx. The knowledge and skill needed for these feats illustrate their mastery of engineering and architecture. These structures also had religious and cultural significance, which encouraged public participation and reinforced societal cohesion. 6. Art, Literature, and Education: Ancient Egypt was rich in artistic and literary achievements. Their writing system, hieroglyphics, allowed them to create records of events, religious texts, and administrative documents. Innovations in art, medicine, and astronomy also contributed to the rich intellectual heritage of their civilization. 7. Trade and Economy: Ancient Egypt prospered through a combination of domestic agricultural production and international trade. They traded goods such as gold, copper, and precious stones with neighboring countries in Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean. This wealth contributed to Egypt's development and cultural achievements, enabling the support of artisans, scholars, and priests. In conclusion, a combination of geographical advantages, agricultural prosperity, centralized governance, strong religious beliefs, advanced architecture and engineering, artistic and literary achievements, and a thriving trade and economy made ancient Egypt a powerful and enduring civilization that has captivated the world for millennia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.  Story: Bill and Paul were farmers. Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't.  Question: Which farmer used a strong water jet to kill aphids? Output:","output":"The task asks you to identify which character in the story used a strong water jet to control aphids. The guidelines given in the prompt mention that you need to understand the relationship between the information given in the background paragraph, the story, and the question. Start by reading and understanding the background paragraph. This provides important information about aphid control - that it can be difficult due to their rapid breeding and that one possible method is the use of a strong water jet. This piece of information is relevant to the question because it ties directly into the method mentioned in the question. Then move on to the story. The story mentions two farmers, Bill and Paul, and specifies that Bill used insecticides to control aphids. It does not give any information about the methods used by Paul, which could indicate that he used different methods from Bill, possibly one of the other methods mentioned in the background paragraph such as a strong water jet. To answer the question, combine your understanding of the background paragraph and its advice on aphid control with the information from the story and the roles of the two farmers. The question asks, \\"Which farmer used a strong water jet to kill aphids?\\" Given that Bill has already been identified as using insecticides, the answer would have to be Paul, despite it not being explicitly stated in the story. Understanding that your answer must be a direct copy and pasting of a piece from the prompt, and since Paul's name is mentioned in the story, your output would be \\"Paul\\"."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

In order to provide a detailed and long answer for describing the sentiment of the tweet, I would need the actual content of the tweet. However, I can provide you with general guidelines on how to determine the sentiment of any given tweet. Sentiment analysis is a process of determining the emotion, opinion, or tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet. The sentiment of a tweet can be classified into three main categories: 1. Positive Sentiment: If a tweet contains positive emotions, compliments, or supportive content, it can be regarded as having a positive sentiment. Users might share their successes, happy moments, appreciation or gratitude towards others, or express their love for a certain brand or product. 2. Negative Sentiment: A tweet with negative emotions, complaints, or critical content is considered to have a negative sentiment. Examples include users expressing anger, frustration, disappointment, or dislike towards a person, service, product, or event. Negative tweets can have a strong impact on brand reputation and influence public perceptions. 3. Neutral Sentiment: A neutral tweet doesn't express strong emotions or opinions. It may simply convey factual information, general observations, or casual conversations where the user does not exhibit a clear emotional response or stance. To determine the sentiment of a tweet, you can follow these steps: 1. Read the tweet carefully and identify the main message or topic. 2. Check for emotional language, such as adjectives and adverbs, that indicate the user's emotions or opinions. 3. Look for emojis or emoticons that may provide clues about the sentiment. 4. Determine if the tweet contains sarcasm, irony, or humor, as these can affect the intended sentiment. 5. Assess the overall tone of the tweet, considering its context, target audience, and purpose. 6. Categorize the tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on your assessment. Keep in mind that sentiment analysis can be subjective, and different people might interpret the same tweet differently. Some AI tools and algorithms are available for automated sentiment analysis of social media content, which can provide more consistent results and help analyze large datasets more efficiently. Once you provide the content of the tweet, I can help you analyze its sentiment more accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel.     When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization.     Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct. The name of an investigation with controlled variables is called a Controlled Experiment or Controlled Scientific Investigation. A controlled experiment is designed to test the relationship between a cause and an effect while eliminating the influence of extraneous variables. This is done by comparing the effect of one or more manipulated variables (called independent variables) on a dependent variable while controlling for all other relevant variables within the experimental setup. The controlled variables are kept constant to ensure accurate comparison, which in turn increases the reliability of the results. The control measurements, as mentioned in the answer you found, serve as a baseline to compare the outcomes of the experiment. In a controlled experiment, there are often two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the manipulated independent variable(s), while the control group is kept under normal or standard conditions, without being exposed to the manipulated variables. Comparing the results from both groups helps researchers observe any differences in the dependent variable, allowing for a clearer understanding of causality and minimizing confounding factors. In summary, a Controlled Experiment or Controlled Scientific Investigation is an investigation with controlled variables, designed to test cause and effect relationships while minimizing the influence of confounding factors. Control measurements, as mentioned in the Google answer, play an essential role in providing a baseline for comparison and enhancing the reliability of the results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If parents yell at their children, the emotional   development of them can be badly affected. Though parents think they are protecting their children at all times, the children will not feel safe when they are yelled at. It can be a very bad experience for children. This can make it difficult for children to enjoy parents' presence   if they are being yelled at. A person needs to be a good listener and also should learn to give others a chance to talk.

She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who threw more touchdown passes, Brett Favre or Tarvaris Jackson?","output":"Title: Brett Favre vs. Tarvaris Jackson: A Tale of Touchdown Passes Introduction: There has always been a keen interest in the National Football League (NFL) regarding the stats and performances of players. In the case of quarterbacks, one key statistic that fans, commentators, and analysts often focus on is the number of touchdown passes they have thrown. This data point paints a picture of the effectiveness of a quarterback in leading his team to score points and ultimately secure victories. In this article, we explore the careers of two notable quarterbacks, Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson, to determine who has thrown more touchdown passes during their time in the NFL. Brett Favre: Brett Favre, nicknamed \\"The Gunslinger,\\" had a celebrated career in the NFL that spanned 20 seasons from 1991 to 2010. Favre spent the majority of his career with the Green Bay Packers before short stints with the New York Jets and the Minnesota Vikings. He is known for his tenacious playing style, impressive records, and passionate approach to the game of football. Throughout his prolific career, Brett Favre showcased his arm strength and remarkable ability to throw touchdown passes. Favre's high level of play and consistency led him to set numerous NFL records, including the most consecutive starts by a quarterback (297) and, until recently, the most career passing yards (71,838). However, for the purpose of this analysis, we are particularly interested in his touchdown pass record. During his time in the league, Brett Favre threw a staggering 508 touchdown passes. This incredible feat was an NFL record until it was later surpassed by Peyton Manning in 2014 and subsequently by Tom Brady. Nevertheless, Favre's total touchdowns remain the third-highest in NFL history, and his impact on the game cannot be overstated. Tarvaris Jackson: Tarvaris Jackson, on the other hand, had a more modest career in the NFL. Playing from 2006 to 2015, Jackson spent six seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, one season with the Buffalo Bills, and three seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. While he may not have attracted the same level of attention as Favre, Jackson’s role as a backup and occasional starter made him an essential part of his teams' offensive strategies. Although Tarvaris Jackson did not amass the same lofty records as Brett Favre in his career, he still managed to carve out a place for himself in the NFL by displaying a strong work ethic and a willingness to learn from coaches and teammates. Throughout his playing days, Jackson threw a total of 39 touchdown passes in the regular season – a respectable achievement for a player who embraced his role as a backup quarterback and contributed to his team's success. Conclusion: When comparing the touchdown pass statistics of Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson, it becomes abundantly clear that Favre had thrown significantly more touchdown passes over the course of his career. With an astounding total of 508 touchdowns, Favre's accomplishments on the gridiron far outshine the 39 touchdown passes thrown by Jackson, who found success as a valued backup quarterback. Though their careers may have taken different paths, both Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson brought their unique skills and styles to the NFL, and their names will forever be etched in the annals of the league's history. In the end, the comparison between Favre and Jackson highlights the importance of a quarterback's ability to throw touchdown passes as a meaningful benchmark to evaluate their impact on and contributions to the game of football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer to this question? where does mechanical digestion occur in the digestive system?","output":"Mechanical digestion is a crucial component of the digestive system as it involves the physical breakdown of ingested food into smaller pieces, which will then be further broken down chemically for absorption and utilization by the body. Mechanical digestion occurs in several locations throughout the digestive system, including the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. 1. Mouth: The process of mechanical digestion starts in the mouth. As food enters the mouth, it is mechanically broken down by the grinding and tearing action of teeth, as well as the muscular movement of the tongue. There are four different types of teeth, each with a specific role:    a. Incisors - located in the front; responsible for cutting and biting    b. Canines - located at the sides; designed for tearing and shredding    c. Premolars - found behind the canines; used for crushing and grinding    d. Molars - located at the back; serve to crush and grind food The tongue assists in maneuvering the food to be efficiently chewed and mixed with saliva, a fluid secreted by the salivary glands. Saliva contains enzymes that initiate chemical digestion, as well as moistening the food to form a bolus, which is easier to swallow. Chewing and the subsequent formation of a bolus result from a combination of voluntary and involuntary (reflexive) actions. 2. Stomach: After leaving the mouth, the bolus travels down the esophagus through peristalsis, which are coordinated muscular contractions, and enters the stomach. The stomach plays a significant role in mechanical digestion by churning and mixing the ingested food. The thick muscular walls of the stomach contract, and the three layers of muscles (longitudinal, circular, and oblique) work together to create an intense churning motion. This mechanical mixing helps break food particles down further and mixes it with gastric juices to form a liquified mixture called chyme. Chyme will be gradually released into the small intestine, where further mechanical digestion and absorption occur. 3. Small Intestine: Mechanical digestion continues in the small intestine, primarily through segmentation. Segmentation is a rhythmic contraction of the smooth muscles lining the walls of the small intestine. This process repeatedly squeezes and mixes the chyme, breaking it down into smaller particles. The chyme is also exposed to various enzymes and bile for further chemical digestion. The small intestine contains villi (tiny, finger-like projections) and microvilli (minute extensions on the surface of villi) that increase its surface area for efficient absorption of nutrients. The contractions of the gastrointestinal smooth muscles propel the digested food forward, facilitating nutrient absorption by the villi and microvilli. In summary, mechanical digestion begins in the mouth with the action of teeth, tongue, and saliva. It continues in the stomach through churning and mixing, breaking down food particles and forming chyme. Finally, the small intestine carries on mechanical digestion by way of segmentation, leading to the absorption of nutrients by the body. This combination of mechanical and chemical actions ensures that the food we eat is broken down and made readily available for our body's energy and growth needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prior to making the purchase I read reviews from multiple sources and while most had good things to say, quite a few mentioned a faulty/poor light meter system. I made the purchase anyway, hoping to get a good one, but it was not to be. The light meter system is a bit cumbersome already when compared to all of the SLRs I've used through the years, but I can set the exposure on a subject, take a picture, and check the exposure before taking the next shot (same subject) and get a totally different reading just monents later. And I'm not talking one or two F-stops, this thing goes from a 'green light' at F4 at 1/60 to showing overexposed at F22 at 1/2000. It is so unreliable that I had to buy a hand-held light meter just to get my son through the semester. And you can bet this camera will be returned for repair/replacement once his class is complete. Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the product and points out the issues they encountered with the faulty/poor light meter system. They also mention having to purchase a separate hand-held light meter to compensate for the camera's unreliability and plan to return the camera for repair or replacement."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Macrophages and dendritic cells are types of what\\"   Choices:  - amoena cells  - supercapacitor cells  - mast cells  - phagocytic cells  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"- phagocytic cells"},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Love it...

Please write a short summary for the following article: Robots Can Be Better Surgeons in the Operating Room When doctors first approached Hormuz Irani, a surgical oncologist based in Bakersfield, Calif., to suggest he participate in the hospital’s robotic-surgery training program, he resisted. He’d been performing laparoscopic surgery since 1995 and heard that the Da Vinci robot was bulky, expensive, and time-consuming. But when he actually started using what he refers to as the “workhorse,” he saw the future of surgery. The optics were clearer. Tremors from his hand vanished because the robot moved in a fluid motion. Smaller incisions left his patients with less pain and shorter healing times. The arms of the robot swiveled 360 degrees, allowing it to do things the human wrist cannot—sew backward, for example, or sew underneath tissue. For more on medical technology, watch this video: “And it’s ergonomic, so you’re not hunched over a patient,” Irani says. “That’s definitely a big plus because we all end up with back, neck, and wrist issues.” The Da Vinci Surgery System was approved by the FDA in 2000, and many more technological advancements have been made since then. Irani sees no sign of that progress slowing, and unlike before, he’s looking forward to it. “A robot could be that much more advantageous to use in the future,” Irani says. “Better, lighter, cheaper.” This article is part of the Future of Work article from Fortune’s July 1, 2016 issue. Click here to see the entire package. Summary:","output":"Robotic surgery using the Da Vinci Surgery System offers significant benefits for both surgeons and patients, according to Hormuz Irani, a surgical oncologist based in California. After initial doubts, Irani found that the robot's clearer optics, fluid motion that eliminated tremors and ability to swivel 360 degrees led to smaller incisions, reduced pain and faster healing times for patients. Additionally, the technology is more ergonomic for surgeons, preventing long-term back, neck and wrist issues. As the technology improves, Irani expects robotic surgery to become even more advantageous with better, lighter, and cheaper systems in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Imagine that you are the first person ever to see Hawaii. What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days. That erupting produced the greatest amount of lava in modern history. In 1960 it erupted again. That time it added a kilometer of beach to the island. Because Mauna Loa has erupted so often, it has become the biggest (but not the tallest) mountain in the world. These volcanoes could be dangerous to the population of Hawaii. In fact, Hilo, the second largest city in Hawaii, is built just under Mauna Loa. The volcano could erupt at any time. Most people believe that it will erupt sometime in the next twenty-five years. But the people of Hilo do not seem worried. They live with the danger as part of their lives. 1. How many islands does Hawaii have? 2.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Extensive mammographic density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and makes the detection of cancer by mammography difficult, but the influence of density on risk according to method of cancer detection is unknown.     METHODS We carried out three nested case-control studies in screened populations with 1112 matched case-control pairs. We examined the association of the measured percentage of density in the baseline mammogram with risk of breast cancer, according to method of cancer detection, time since the initiation of screening, and age.     RESULTS As compared with women with density in less than 10% of the mammogram, women with density in 75% or more had an increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 7.4), whether detected by screening (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.2) or less than 12 months after a negative screening examination (odds ratio, 17.8; 95% CI, 4.8 to 65.9). Increased risk of breast cancer, whether detected by screening or other means, persisted for at least 8 years after study entry and was greater in younger than in older women. For women younger than the median age of 56 years, 26% of all breast cancers and 50% of cancers detected less than 12 months after a negative screening test were attributable to density in 50% or more of the mammogram.     CONCLUSIONS Extensive mammographic density is strongly associated with the risk of breast cancer detected by screening or between screening tests. A substantial fraction of breast cancers can be attributed to this risk factor..

The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails  and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting  gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  and the situation: Stargazers across the world wait for 2020 when newly discovered very bright Neil's comet would start to pass through the inner solar system On December 21, 2020.

The review has delivered strong points criticizing the remastered version of the product which raises serious questions about its quality. I would consider the reviewer's comments as they seem to have enough knowledge on the topic. However, it's essential to evaluate the review critically since opinions on subjective matters like music can differ drastically among individuals. Primarily, the reviewer emphasises that this is a remaster of a well-known record which, according to them, does not stand up to the quality of the original recording. The vehement language used - 'Horrifying remasters' - indicates a significant degree of disappointment, suggesting the changes made in the remastered version have altered or distorted the elements that were appreciated in the original record. As a prospective buyer, it implies that the product might not deliver what is expected, which could diminish my eagerness to purchase it. Moreover, the reviewer advises readers to buy the original recording from 1984, stating it as an '5 absolute stars album'. This further cements the comparison that the remaster is inferior to the original. In this context, it is clearly recommended to seek out the original version rather than purchasing the remastered version, making the purchase of this product less attractive. However, as a consumer, it would be important to consider other reviews and perspectives as well. While this individual found the remaster horrifying, others may consider the alterations an improvement. Layering personal preference regarding music interpretation and recording quality over this review might give a more rounded view. For instance, if I generally enjoy remastered versions because of stylistic reasons, this review might not decrease my tendency to buy the product as significantly. To conclude, this review generally leans towards decreasing the chances of buying the product due to its criticism towards the remastered version and preference for the original. However, personal preference, contrasting reviews and further research on the remastered product should also play a significant role in making a final purchase determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The scheme to bore through the Peak District to improve links between Sheffield and Manchester is feasible, but further investigation is needed. Such a tunnel would result in quicker journey times and avoid  delays caused by poor weather in the winter months. Highways England, which produced the report, said a more in-depth study will be ready by the autumn of 2016. The government study looked at the feasibility of tunnelling under the A628 Woodhead Pass, in a scheme which would reportedly cost £6bn. The document says it is possible the tunnel could cut current road journey times by up to 30 minutes and avoid the delays caused by bad weather over the Pennines . The planned new link between Sheffield and Manchester would \\"include a tunnelled section, which could range from between 20-30km (12.4 -18.6 miles), making it one of the longest road tunnels ever built.\\" The authors say: \\"The construction of a new strategic road link between Manchester and Sheffield is technically feasible, although it is likely to include a tunnel (or series of tunnels) that could be longer than any road tunnel constructed in Europe to date.\\" The paper's preliminary findings include: \\"The development of a combined road and rail corridor through the tunnelled section could offer some additional benefits, although road and rail would need to occupy separate tunnel bores and we have not yet established the operational case for this type of solution.\\" Although the paper only looks at the early ideas for such a scheme, Highways England said no means of funding the plan had yet been identified, but there could be a toll levied on tunnel users. The report says: \\"We have not had time yet to do any transport modelling of benefits and costs from a trans-Pennine tunnel. \\"The analysis presented in this report is purely to determine whether there is a case to do more intensive work on investigating tunnel options.\\" Highways officials said the tunnel would need to have an operational  life of 120 years and \\"anticipate quite radical changes in technology and tunnel use\\". \\"Our initial conclusion is that, in tunnel sections additional bores would be required to accommodate rail alongside road. \\"Light rail could, in principle, share road space with highway traffic, but low operating speeds and the fact that this mode is more suited to dense urban areas, may make it undesirable.\\" The options in the report are separate from the Department of Transport's £15bn package to transform major roads across England.

If Both cover packages are basically bullish on the stock market., can we conclude that \\"Both cover packages are worthless on the stock market. \\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Both cover packages are worthless on the stock market.\\" just because both cover packages are basically bullish on the stock market. Being bullish means that one has an optimistic outlook for the stock market and expects it to increase in value over time. This sentiment can stem from various factors, including strong economic fundamentals, positive company news, or an encouraging macroeconomic environment. While the cover packages might share a similar outlook, it doesn't inherently mean that they have no value or relevance in the stock market. To better assess the worth of both cover packages in the stock market, we can consider the following factors: 1. Quality of research and analysis: Consider the depth, accuracy, and relevance of the research and analysis provided in each cover package. Thorough and well-researched information can be invaluable to investors, regardless of the bullish sentiment. Check if the information is based on rigorous analytical models, data-driven insights, and a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. 2. Diversification and risk management: Analyze whether both packages provide diverse investment strategies and have adequate risk management techniques in place. A bullish outlook should still include strategies for mitigating and managing risks, enabling investors to protect their investments during downturns. 3. Expertise and credibility: The expertise of the professionals behind the cover packages is crucial in determining their worth. Knowledgeable experts with proven track records can provide valuable input and advice based on years of experience, increasing the usefulness of the cover packages. 4. Timeliness and adaptability: Assess whether both cover packages offer frequent updates and analysis based on new information, indicators, and market trends. Rapidly changing markets may require timely strategies and insights, so the adaptability of the packages can be a key point in determining their worth on the stock market. 5. Customer reviews and support: Look for customer reviews and testimonials to gauge the satisfaction of other investors who have used the cover packages. Quality customer support and easily accessible resources such as educational content and webinars may also contribute to their overall worth. In conclusion, the bullish sentiment of both cover packages is just one aspect of their overall worth in the stock market. A deeper analysis of their research quality, risk management, credibility, adaptability, and customer support is required to accurately assess their value. If these factors align positively, then the cover packages can indeed offer valuable support to investors in their trading and investment activities, regardless of their shared bullish outlook."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: More is spent on jobless in U.S., but benefits near end By Dennis Cauchon, USA TODAY More than 3 million Americans could lose unemployment benefits by the end of July even as the government spends record amounts to compensate the jobless, a USA TODAY analysis shows. The growing number of unemployed workers without benefits comes as Congress argues whether to again extend jobless benefits. The number of people collecting benefits will fall from 10.5 million to 7 million at the end of July if Congress doesn't extend the payments. About 400,000 Americans are exhausting their benefits every week, saving the government 2 billion since June and an estimated 34 billion through November. Unemployment insurance has played a bigger role in this recession — the longest since the Great Depression— than in previous downturns, the USA TODAY analysis finds. This extraordinary response has helped as many as 11 million people at one time — a record — while driving the program's cost to an annual rate of 145 billion in the first quarter. That's more than double what was spent in any previous recession, after adjusting for inflation. Congress has extended unemployment benefits in every recession since the 1950s. The current extension — up to 99 weeks — far exceeds the previous longest extension of 65 weeks in 1975. Economist Chris O'Leary of the non-partisan Upjohn Institute for Employment Research says jobless benefits have never been scaled back with unemployment near 10%. \\"An extension seems appropriate,\\" he says. Labor expert James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation says a more limited extension is needed. \\"Two years is excessive,\\" he says. \\"If you've gone that long without work, there's a range of other anti-poverty programs available.\\" How unemployment benefits have changed: • Higher payments. Cash benefits were paid at a record annual rate of 14,025 per person in the first quarter, about 2,000 more in inflation-adjusted dollars than when the recession started. • Broader coverage. About 70% of unemployed people have gotten benefits in this recession, more than in earlier recessions. • New benefits. A subsidy helps one in seven jobless workers keep medical insurance through former employers. Those benefits, worth about 3,000 for workers who qualify, end when a person's unemployment insurance expires. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

(March 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film begins with Shelby (Mischa Barton) driving at night while crying and smoking a cigarette, which she drops and then hits someone who was standing in the path of the car. Mike (Matt Long), Shelby's ex-boyfriend, has a new girlfriend, Elizabeth (Jessica Stroup), and they are preparing to go to Mt. Bliss, Mike's hometown, because the football team is going to be retiring his jersey. Shelby has problems with the bank about the bowling alley she inherited when her mother died and still believes that she and Mike are still an item. After the football game Mike and Elizabeth decide to go to Shelby's bowling alley. When Shelby sees Mike she kisses him, but Mike tells her that he has a new girlfriend. Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after. Shelby then tells her that Mike's parents are over judgmental, making Elizabeth nervous. Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley. Mike tells her that since Elizabeth wanted to make a good impression, she decided to stay at a motel. Mike's mother questions him why Elizabeth would think that, implying that Shelby lied to Elizabeth.

Given the context: What does Carson need to do before this? Select from: [-] needed to stop playing soccer [-] practice soccer [-] needed to spend many years practicing The answer is:","output":"Carson needed to spend many years practicing soccer. In order to achieve a high level of skill in soccer and be good enough to earn a full scholarship to the school of his choice, Carson needed to spend many years dedicated to practicing and honing his skills. This required dedication, discipline, and constant improvement in various aspects of his game. To begin with, Carson must have started playing soccer at a young age, learning the basic rules and techniques of the game. This early foundation allowed him to develop muscle memory, coordination, and understanding of the sport, which enabled him to perform fundamental skills such as passing, shooting, and dribbling with ease. As Carson grew older and continued to practice, he needed to focus on specific areas of the game that would ultimately set him apart from other players. This included working on his individual skills like ball control, shooting accuracy, and physical fitness. Ball control is an essential skill for any soccer player since it allows them to keep possession of the ball and create scoring opportunities for their team. Shooting accuracy is crucial for a player to score goals consistently, a valuable asset for any team. Physical fitness, on the other hand, ensures that a player can maintain a high level of performance throughout the entire match, as well as helping prevent injuries. In addition to individual skills, Carson also needed to develop a strong understanding of the tactical side of soccer. This involved learning various formations and strategies employed by his team and the opposition and understanding his role within these systems. Soccer is a team sport, and being able to work effectively with teammates is essential for success. This required Carson to develop effective communication skills and show a high level of adaptability on the field. Moreover, Carson had to participate in competitive matches and tournaments, both locally and against teams from other regions. These competitive environments helped Carson not only apply and test his skills under pressure but also get noticed by scouts and coaches, which ultimately contributed to his chances of securing a scholarship. To maintain his high level of performance and ensure that he kept improving throughout the years, Carson needed a mindset focused on constant learning and growth. This meant analyzing his performances after each game, seeking feedback from his coaches and teammates, and addressing any weaknesses identified. By doing this, he was able to refine his game and ensure that he remained a top-level soccer player. Finally, Carson had to maintain a healthy lifestyle and discipline, which included proper nutrition, regular exercise, and managing stress effectively. A soccer scholarship is highly competitive, and maintaining peak physical and mental condition is paramount to achieving success. In summary, Carson needed to spend many years practicing and mastering various aspects of soccer to reach the skill level required to earn a full scholarship to the school of his choice. This was achieved through hard work, dedication, and relentless focus on improvement in both his individual skills and his ability to work as part of a team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Meredith was born in 1907 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Ida Beth (nee Burgess) and Dr. William George Meredith, a Canadian-born physician, of English descent. His mother came from a long line of Methodist revivalists, a religion to which he adhered throughout his lifetime. Meredith graduated from Hoosac School in 1926 and then attended Amherst College (class of 1931). He left Amherst, and became a reporter for the Stamford Advocate. Early in his career, Meredith attracted favorable attention, especially for playing George in a 1939 adaptation of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and as war correspondent Ernie Pyle in The Story of G.I. Joe (1945). He was featured in many 1940s films, including three -- Second Chorus (1940), Diary of a Chambermaid (1946), and On Our Merry Way (1948) -- co-starring then-wife Paulette Goddard. He also played alongside Lana Turner in Madame X. As a result of the House Committee on Un-American Activities investigation, Meredith was placed on the Hollywood blacklist, and was largely absent from film for the next decade, though he remained involved in stage plays and radio during this time.  Meredith was a favorite of director Otto Preminger, who cast him in Advise and Consent (1962), The Cardinal (1963), In Harm's Way (1965), Hurry Sundown (1967), Skidoo (1968), and Such Good Friends (1971). He was in Stay Away Joe (1968), appearing as the father of Elvis Presley's character. In 1975, he received critical acclaim for his performance as Harry Greene in The Day of the Locust and received nominations for the BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Academy Award for best supporting actor. Meredith then played Rocky Balboa's trainer, Mickey Goldmill, in the first three Rocky films (1976, 1979, and 1982). Though his character died in the third Rocky film, he returned briefly in a flashback in the fifth film, Rocky V (1990). His portrayal in the first film earned him his second consecutive nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Meredith played an old Korean War veteran Captain J.G. Williams in The Last Chase with Lee Majors. He appeared in Ray Harryhausen's last stop-motion feature Clash of the Titans (1981), in a supporting role. Meredith appeared in Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), and was a voice actor in G.I. Joe: The Movie (1989). In his last years, he played Jack Lemmon's character's sex-crazed 95-year-old father in Grumpy Old Men (1993) and its sequel, Grumpier Old Men (1995).  Meredith directed the movie The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949) starring Charles Laughton, which was produced by Irving Allen. Meredith also was billed in a supporting role in this film. In 1970, he directed (as well as co-wrote and played a supporting role in) The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go, an espionage caper starring James Mason and Jeff Bridges. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what was burgess involvement with cinema?","output":"Burgess Meredith's involvement with cinema was extensive, as he acted in numerous films throughout his career and even directed a few.

Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!  Two teams of students studied Earth's atmosphere in class. They also started studying Venus' atmosphere.

He repeated the operation three times, and returned home happily with 60 dollars.

A) helpful and considerate B) positive and generous C) smart and hardworking D) nervous and unselfish Answer:","output":"The man in this story could be best described as C) smart and hardworking. This is evident from his journey which shows an incredible demonstration of resilience, creativity, and dedication. Starting with only ten dollars and a pack of tomatoes, the man showcases his entrepreneurial spirit and hard work by selling the tomatoes door to door. Instead of giving up when faced with adversity, he manages to double his money and repeats the process until he has a considerable sum. His smart decision-making capability is seen when he scales up his operation slowly but steadily. He doesn't rush to make a huge investment but rather, starting from a cart, he gradually builds up to owning a truck and eventually, a fleet of delivery vehicles. This shows his smartness as he didn't take undue risks and instead, chose to grow his business gradually, ensuring its stability and sustainability. Hence, the man's story is a testament to a strong work ethic, self-reliance, intelligent strategies, and resourcefulness, demonstrating why he could be best described as C) smart and hardworking. His journey exemplifies that success can be achieved with determination, creativity, and hard work, even without the benefit of modern technology like email. The man cultivates a business empire from just selling tomatoes door to door, which portrays his determination and illustrates the significant power of hard work combined with smart planning.  Towards the end, he displays a good sense of humor when, upon being asked to imagine where he could have been if he had an email address, he jokingly says he would have been an \\"office boy at Microsoft,\\" subtly implying that he has achieved much more without an email.  Overall, the hardships faced by the man didn't deter him from his path; instead, they propelled him to work harder and smarter, thus reinforcing him as a person with strong determination and intelligence. His combined qualities of smartness and hardworking nature enabled him to overcome obstacles and achieve success in the end. He didn't merely exist; he crafted a remarkable life through his dedication, perseverance, and wise choices.

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining the f terms. 1289*f - 11953*f is the same as -10664*f, so the equation becomes: 1,139,770 = -10664*f - 86590 Still with me? Awesome! Now, we're going to add 86590 to both sides of the equation to isolate the f term: 1,139,770 + 86590 = -10664*f This gives us: 1,226,360 = -10664*f To find the value of f, we need to divide by -10664: f = 1,226,360 / -10664 The answer is: f = -115 And that's it!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. First Thoughts: The Four Years War So these insurance cancellation notices. I hear a lot about them. What's the deal? Let's start with the very basics here. About 15 million people purchase health insurance policies on the individual market. That's about 5 percent of the population. When they do so, they typically purchase a 12-month contract with an insurance company. And when that contract runs out, both the individual and the insurance plan have an escape hatch. The individual can decide to no longer purchase the plan -- and the insurance company can decide to no longer offer the plan. Most individuals don't stay in the individual market very long: One study, published in the journal Health Affairs, found that 17 percent of individual market subscribers purchased the same plan for two straight years or longer. There are some restrictions on how insurance companies can terminate products. HIPAA, a health law passed in the 1990s, does require that insurance companies offer subscribers the opportunity to renew their policy, so long as they continue to pay monthly premiums. If they want to discontinue a subscriber's policy, the insurance plan must provide 90 days notice and \\"the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in that market.\\" And these are the notices that insurance plans are sending out right now, to hundreds of thousands of subscribers: notices saying that they do not plan to offer the policy anymore, and information about what policies will be available. So why is this happening right now? Some -- or maybe even most -- of the plans offered on the individual insurance market right now don't meet certain requirements in the health-care law. They may not offer preventive care without co-payment, for example, or leave out coverage of maternity care, one of the health-care law's 10 essential benefits. Some of these plans have stuck around for a little bit. The health law allowed plans that existed back in March 2010, when it became a law, to keep selling coverage. These are known as \\"grandfathered plans:\\" They don't meet the health law's requirements, but as long as they don't change much, insurers can keep offering them. Insurance companies typically do like to change their insurance plans, making changes to cost-sharing or the benefits they offer. That means that grandfathered plans have disappeared. We don't have great data about how quickly this is happening in the individual market, but we do see it in this Kaiser Family Foundation survey of the employer market. These cancellations are, essentially, a lot of grandfathered plans exiting the insurance marketplace. From an insurance company's vantage point, grandfathered plans are a bit of a dead end: They can't enroll new subscribers and are really constrained in their ability to tweak the benefit package or cost-sharing structure. There's not a whole lot of business sense, for a managed care company, in maintaining a health plan that doesn't meet the health law's new requirements. How many people are going to get cancellation notices? It's hard to put an exact number on this, given that insurance plans are the ones who decide whether or not to continue offering an insurance product. Experts haveestimated that somewhere between half and three-quarters of those who currently buy their own policies will not have the option to renew coverage, which works out to around 7 to 12 million people. What does this have to do with Obamacare? Pretty much everything: Since the health-care law required insurance companies to change their plans, this is a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. What do they look like? Michelle Malkin posted a copy of her notice last month, which you can take a look at here. In general, these are pretty much the dull, bureaucratic forms that you would imagine an insurance plan sending out. The federal government did draft some sample language for them to use, although it doesn't really address the fact that the insurance plan isn't being renewed. How did nobody see this coming? President Obama has repeatedly said, since the health law passed, that if people like their insurance they could keep it. Which is a weird promise to make when one of the key goals of the health-care law is to change individual market insurance coverage. There are lots of insurance policies, especially on the individual market, that are really bare bones. Some argue they shouldn't even be called insurance coverage, because their coverage is too sparse to insure against financial ruin. One report from the Obama administration, issued in 2011, found that 62 percent of individual market plans don't offer maternity care. Eighteen percent do not cover mental health benefits and 9 percent do not pay for prescription drugs. The health-care law requires insurance plans to cover all of those things, and then some. This includes spending at least 80 percent of subscriber premiums on medical care (leaving 20 percent for administration and profits), covering 10 benefit categories and providing preventive care without any co-payment. That means insurance companies cannot, under the Affordable Care Act, keep selling the plans that they used to sell -- the ones that don't cover prescription drugs and maternity care. And that means that some people who liked purchasing coverage without maternity care and prescription drugs won't be able to keep those plans. The cancellation notices are a feature of the Affordable Care Act, not a bug. The idea was to make insurance coverage more robust -- and that means cancelling policies that offer less thorough coverage. Who thought that was a good idea? The drafters of the Affordable Care Act! The whole idea of the insurance expansion isn't to get Americans to purchase anything called \\"insurance.\\" It's to get them to purchase a specific kind of insurance, a plan that is relatively comprehensive and helps protect against financial ruin. If Americans were going to be required to buy a product, the reasoning goes, it should be one that can actually do some good. Of course, not everyone agrees with this; some contend that shoppers should be able to continue buying less robust insurance policies and have the option of taking on more financial risk. Does a cancellation mean I'm going uninsured? Nope -- as mentioned earlier, insurance plans are required by law to tell you about other options they offer if they discontinue their policy. That's what the sample language from the administration, above, essentially does. Individuals with discontinued policies will have the option to purchase through the new insurance marketplaces (well, if they start working a little better) or they can do so outside the new marketplaces, pretty much like they have in years past. This will vary a lot from person to person. Some people who are buying a bare-bones plan right now will likely see higher premiums under Obamacare. They'd be getting more benefits -- but paying more in premiums. Some people will get financial help buying that more robust insurance; people who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line (about 45,000 for an individual) can use a tax subsidy to purchase their plan. For more on premiums under the Affordable Care Act, you should read this great piece from Ezra. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Four Years War is about health insurance cancellation notices, which are being sent to millions of people who have insurance plans that don't meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). The health law has certain requirements that insurance plans must follow, like covering preventive care without co-payments and including coverage for essential benefits such as maternity care. Many existing plans don't meet these requirements, so they're being canceled and replaced with new plans that do meet the requirements. This is happening because the goal of the Affordable Care Act is to improve insurance coverage and make it more comprehensive, even though it may mean some people will have to pay more for their insurance. If your insurance plan is canceled, you'll have the option to purchase a new one that meets the requirements, either through the new insurance marketplaces or outside of them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Logic test: Bill throws a boulder and a balloon. The balloon falls much slower than the boulder meaning it (A) weighs more (B) weighs less A:","output":"The answer your students should choose between \\"balloon\\" and \\"boulder\\" in this logic test is \\"balloon\\" which corresponds to option B (weighs less). Let's break down the scenario to better understand the logic: Test Scenario: Bill throws a boulder and a balloon. Observed Fact: The balloon falls much slower than the boulder. The task given to students is to deduce the logical conclusion from the observed fact and choose the correct answer between \\"balloon\\" and \\"boulder\\". According to the forces acting on an object in free fall, primarily gravity and air resistance, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the acceleration due to gravity working on it. A heavier object experiences greater gravitational force, which in turn results in higher acceleration. However, air resistance can also affect the speed at which an object falls, with a larger and lighter object (such as a balloon) encountering more air resistance and ultimately falling at a slower speed. The given logic test presents two options: Option A: The balloon weighs more.  Option B: The balloon weighs less. Because the balloon falls slower than the boulder, students are asked to analyze the relationship between weight and the speed at which an object falls. If the balloon weighed more, it would experience a greater gravitational force and, consequently, fall faster. However, this scenario contradicts the observed fact. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. On the other hand, option B supports the observed fact that the balloon falls more slowly due to it weighing less than the boulder. The lighter weight of the balloon means it experiences less gravitational force and, when combined with the larger air resistance it experiences, results in a slower fall. This aligns with the observed fact and displays the logical conclusion that the students should arrive at. So the correct answer for this logic test is \\"balloon” corresponding to option B (weighs less)."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for? , can you please find it?   Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house.  The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument.  The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce).  Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.  The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.  Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings.  St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee.  Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871.  The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896.  The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.  For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Populations may show different patterns of growth. The growth pattern depends partly on the conditions under which a population lives. Two common growth patterns are exponential growth and logistic growth. Both are represented in Figure below .   Choices:  - migratory and logistic  - exponential and economical  - organic and inorganic  - exponential and logistic   A: Answer:","output":"The two common growth patterns of population mentioned in the paragraph are exponential growth and logistic growth. The growth pattern of a population depends on the conditions under which a population lives. As stated, both exponential growth and logistic growth are represented in Figure below. Let's explore these two growth patterns further: 1. Exponential growth: It occurs when the resources available to a population are abundant, and the population size increases at a constant rate over time. In exponential growth, the number of individuals added to the population during each time period is proportional to the current population size. It is also known as unregulated or unrestricted growth, as there is no limit to the population size and growth rate. The exponential growth can be represented by the formula:    N(t) = N(0) * e^(r*t)    Where N(t) is the population size at time t, N(0) is the initial population size, e is the base of natural logarithms, r is the intrinsic growth rate, and t is time. 2. Logistic growth: In contrast to exponential growth, logistic growth occurs when the resources available to a population are limited, and the population size reaches an equilibrium. In this case, the population growth rate gradually slows down as the population approaches its carrying capacity (the maximum number of individuals that can be sustained by the available resources). Logistic growth is also known as regulated or restricted growth. The logistic growth can be represented by the formula:    N(t) = (K * N(0) * e^(r*t)) / (K + N(0) * (e^(r*t) - 1))    Where N(t) is the population size at time t, N(0) is the initial population size, e is the base of natural logarithms, r is the intrinsic growth rate, K is the carrying capacity, and t is time. In summary, the correct option from the provided answers is \\"exponential and logistic,\\" as these are the two common growth patterns of population discussed in the paragraph. These growth patterns depend on the conditions under which a population lives, with exponential growth representing abundant resources and unrestricted growth, and logistic growth representing limited resources and a state of equilibrium."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can buy sets of cards, or make your own, and carry them with you wherever you go. There's no question this is useful and because you can use them in short bursts, it's not too much for you. It can be fun. I don't recommend drilling for hours at a time with flashcards. If you want to use flashcard software, things get even better. There are many packages out there for maintaining and drilling flashcards. I recommend VTrain though there are many others. One stands out, however: SuperMemo. Similar to Pimsleur, SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology   in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick. When you look at a card, you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it. It uses this information, and that of your previous attempts, to decide when you will be shown the card next. It's smart and it really works. If you're like me, the news is even better! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone. Wherever I am, if I have my phone handy, I have thousands of flashcards with me too.

The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it didn't happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. Apart from the general awfulness of the film, I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, let's break it down step by step: 1.

Step 1: To find 's', we need to get 's' by itself.  We have the equation -2031728 = -129*s - 2025407 Step 2: Let's add 2025407 to both sides to cancel it out from the right side of the equation. It would be like saying, if you have 3 cookies and I take away 3, you have none left. Let's do it: -2031728 + 2025407 = -129*s - 2025407 + 2025407 Which changes our equation to: -636321 = -129*s  Step 3: Now we're almost there.

This is the second best burger in the U.S.    B&B Burger & Beer was a Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich venture. They had other jointly owned establishments in town, so this provided B&B with enhanced access to stellar ingredients. The beef was a prime example. The beef blend (50% Brisket and 50% Chuck) was ground and blended fresh daily onsite from hand-selected sides of beef from Niman Ranch. The beef was broken down, ground, and blended by the on-site butcher. Yes, these guys had a guy picking out the sides of beef for the burgers. Niman Ranch beef is 100% Angus, vegetarian diet, and no hormones/antibiotic free. The burgers came out at 6 ounces each. The Drive Thru was two 3-ounce patties, and my burger was a single 6-ounce patty. The beef was splendid. The flavor hit us in a rush of sear, beef, salt and pepper, complex mineral notes, and a little blood. The texture was firm and then creamy. The burger patty was perfectly juicy with no trace of oiliness. The beef resembled  Stracciatella cheese  in its complexity and delicate texture, but the beef brought a sledgehammer of flavor to the palate. This was one of those bites that made me smile and slow down as I savored eat bite. The Drive-Thru Burger was very similar to my Bar Burger, except that burger had twice the sear and twice the cheese. I will be getting that burger on my next visit. The beef was perfect.  B&B Burger & Beer is now on my list of top burgers in the country. It edged out the burgers at BurGR on the merit of the sear. This burger was on par with the spectacular cheeseburger at The Brindle Room in NYC. I found myself already missing the burger as took my last few bites.

Summarize this article: When purchasing men’s jeans, look for inseam measurements on the back label. They will typically be listed with waist size first and inseam second, so a pair of pants marked 34x32 will have a 34 in (86 cm) waist and a 32 in (81 cm) inseam. Women’s jeans rarely list the inseam, so you may have to consult a store attendant, make a conversion using the brand’s sizing chart, or measure the seam yourself. Websites like Search By Inseam allow you to find the inseam measurements for popular pant brands. Though compact shoes and sneakers won’t make a significant difference, high heels and similar shoes may. In general, add between .5 and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.5 cm) to your inseam measurement to accommodate raised shoes. If possible, measure your inseam while wearing the raised shoes to get a more precise number. Over time, jeans made from cotton, linen, and wool may shrink, something that will affect the inseam. If purchasing a name brand pair, search online for information on how much you should expect the pants to shrink. If necessary, purchase pants with an inseam that is about .5 inches (1.3 cm) too large, giving the legs room to shrink. Summary:","output":"When buying jeans, look at the label on the back to find the sizes. For men's jeans, you'll see the waist size and then the inseam length, like 34x32. For women's jeans, it can be tricky because they don't always show the inseam length, so ask someone who works at the store or use a special chart to figure it out. You might need to add a little bit of length if you wear high shoes. Sometimes, jeans can get smaller after wearing and washing them, so check if the jeans you're buying might shrink and maybe buy a slightly bigger size."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed 25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.  Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.  Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. What did the do there?","output":"At the Feminist Art Program at Fresno State College and later at the California Institute of the Arts, Judy Chicago and her students engaged in a groundbreaking exploration of art from a feminist perspective. They aimed to develop a new approach to art that represented and celebrated women's experiences, histories, and contributions to society. To achieve these goals, they undertook various activities and created impactful artworks that have left a lasting mark on the art world. Here's a brief overview of what they did: 1. Skill Development:Chicago taught various artistic skills including needlework, painting, sculpture, and other traditional and non-traditional art forms to empower her students to express their unique feminine perspectives in their work. They also experimented with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. 2. Collaborative Art Projects: The students in the program worked together on collaborative projects that highlighted women's shared experiences and challenged the societal norms and expectations surrounding womanhood. One such project was Womanhouse, created in collaboration with Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space dedicated to presenting art from a female point of view. 3. Reading and Discussion Groups: Chicago and her students held regular reading and discussion groups focused on women's life experiences, feminist theory, and women's history. These discussions helped inform their artistic expression and deepen their understanding of the female experience. 4. Renovation and Maintenance of the Studio Space: The students and Chicago contributed to the renting and refurbishing of an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. By collaborating on the creation and maintenance of their workspace, the students in the program established an environment that was truly supportive of women artists. 5. Founding the Los Angeles Woman's Building: In 1973, Judy Chicago, alongside Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building—an art school, workshop, and exhibition space exclusively for female artists. The establishment of the Woman's Building provided women artists with a supportive and nurturing environment in which to create, learn, and exhibit their work. 6. Developing and Displaying Feminist Art: Under Chicago's guidance and mentorship, students in the program produced a variety of feminist artworks that explored themes such as gender, identity, power, and control. These artworks often incorporated traditional feminine art forms and materials, like needlework and fabric, alongside more conventionally \\"masculine\\" techniques like welding and pyrotechnics. By doing so, the artists effectively subverted traditional gender norms and expectations in the art world. 7. Influencing Future Generations: The Feminist Art Program played a significant role in the broader feminist art movement of the 1970s and, in turn, has left a lasting impact on generations of artists who came after them. The program has inspired and influenced numerous artists and art educators to continue examining the role of women in art, culture, and society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.  I am facing a new situation today: Two cities had different energy source. Big city burned fossil fuels cut forests and cleared land, while Blue city used alternative sources of energy.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city cleared more lands? A:","output":"From the information provided in the background article and the given situation, it can be deduced that Big City cleared more lands than Blue City. To support this conclusion, let's analyze the activities mentioned for each city: Big City: 1. Burned fossil fuels: When fossil fuels are burned for energy production, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that Big City relied heavily on non-renewable energy sources. 2. Cut forests and cleared land: These activities, especially when combined with burning, again contribute significantly to the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. By cutting forests and clearing land, Big City decreased the number of autotrophic organisms (such as plants), which actively uptake carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Blue City: 1. Used alternative sources of energy: Blue City opted for alternative, likely renewable, energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydro power. These sources produce minimal or no carbon dioxide emissions, and as a result, have less impact on the environment and the atmosphere. Considering these activities, it becomes evident that Big City cleared more lands than Blue City. Their dependence on burning fossil fuels, coupled with the removal of forests and land clearance, are strong indicators that Big City took actions resulting in a higher carbon dioxide output. On the other hand, Blue City's efforts to adopt alternative energy sources reflect a more environmentally friendly approach, which would likely involve minimal or no land clearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Hirsch held the opinion that Judaism demands an application of Torah thought to the entire realm of human experience, including the secular disciplines. His approach was termed the Torah im Derech Eretz approach, or \\"neo-Orthodoxy\\". While insisting on strict adherence to Jewish beliefs and practices, he held that Jews should attempt to engage and influence the modern world, and encouraged those secular studies compatible with Torah thought. This pattern of religious and secular involvement has been evident at many times in Jewish history. Scholars[who?] believe it was characteristic of the Jews in Babylon during the Amoraic and Geonic periods, and likewise in early medieval Spain, shown by their engagement with both Muslim and Christian society.

Given the question: Information:  - Carposinidae , the \`\` fruitworm moths '' is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order . These moths are narrower winged than Copromorphidae , with less rounded forewing tips . Males often have conspicuous patches of scales on either surface ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The mouthparts are quite diagnostic , usually with prominent , upcurved \`\` labial palps '' , the third segment long ( especially in females ) , and the second segment covered in large scales . Unlike Copromorphidae , the \`\` M2 '' and sometimes \`\` M1 '' vein on the hindwings is absent . The relationship of Carposinidae relative to Copromorphidae needs further investigation . It is considered possible that the family is artificial , being nested within Copromorphidae ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The Palearctic species have been revised by Diakonoff ( 1989 ) .  - A pupa (Latin \\"pupa\\" for doll, plural: \\"pupae\\" or \\"pupas\\") is the life stage of some insects undergoing transformation. The pupal stage is found only in holometabolous insects, those that undergo a complete metamorphosis, going through four life stages: embryo, larva, pupa and imago.  - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.  - Caterpillar is the common name for the larvae of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths).  - Copromorphoidea, the \\"fruitworm moths\\" is a superfamily of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths are small to medium-sized (1050 mm. in wingspan) and are broad-winged bearing some resemblance to the superfamilies Tortricoidea and Immoidea. The antennae are often \\"pectinate\\" especially in males, and many species of these well camouflaged moths bear raised tufts of scales on the wings and a specialised fringe of scales at the base of the hindwing sometimes in females only; there are a number of other structural characteristics (Common, 1990; Dugdale et al., 1999) . The position of this superfamily is not certain, but it has been placed in the natural group of \\"Apoditrysia\\" \\"Obtectomera\\" (Minet, 1991), rather than with the superfamilies Alucitoidea or Epermenioidea within which it has sometimes previously been placed, on the grounds that shared larval and pupal characteristics of these groups have probably evolved independently. It has been suggested that the division into two families should be abandoned (e.g. Holloway et al., 2001).  - Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.  - Copromorphidae, the \\"tropical fruitworm moths\\" is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths have broad, rounded forewings, and well-camouflaged scale patterns. Unlike Carposinidae the mouthparts include \\"labial palps\\" with the second rather than third segment the longest. The position of the enigmatic New Zealand genus \\"Isonomeutis\\" in this family in uncertain, as it lacks the flimsy cuticle of the pupa characteristic of other Copromorphoidea. With other unusual structural characteristics of the caterpillar and adult, it could represent the sister lineage of all other extant members of this superfamily (Dugdale et al., 1999). The genus \\"Sisyroxena\\" from Madagascar is also notable for its unusual venation and wing scale sockets (Dugdale et al., 1999).  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a Mississippi nursing home to photograph U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's ailing wife, who is suffering from dementia. \\"It's the worst,\\" says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust. This race, one of the nastiest so far this election year, has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that. Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide, Kay Webber. Cochran: Quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge. Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime. McDaniel's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list, while the Cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist. New ads in nasty Mississippi primary. This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP: a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending, out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington. Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife. \\"Our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever, and the evidence has shown that. What we're doing right now -- we're talking about the issues,\\" McDaniel told CNN in an interview. The next Ted Cruz? But what gave ammunition to Cochran allies is that McDaniel's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent. When we asked for clarification, McDaniel wouldn't go there, replying, \\"Look, we're going to focus on his record.\\" Three more arrested in Mississippi Senate primary scandal. If McDaniel has his way, he would be the next Ted Cruz, going to the Senate to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles, compromise be damned. \\"We don't have six more years of the status quo,\\" he said. \\"I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals. I'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution. We don't have time to waste. So with all due respect I would suggest they join me in this fight because they've been silent far too long,\\" he told us. \\"He and I are very different with our ideology. He's a guy that believes in big government. He believes in big spending. He believes in increasing taxes. He believes in increasing his own pay. I am not that guy,\\" McDaniel said. For the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from Kentucky to Idaho -- McDaniel has been its great hope of 2014, the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment Republican. Things were looking good for McDaniel earlier this year, especially after Cochran stumbled by telling a local reporter here that \\"the tea party is something I don't really know a lot about.\\" Millions of dollars pouring into Mississippi against Cochran come from a who's who of national tea party groups nationwide: Citizens United, Club For Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, Tea Party Patriots and Freedomworks. The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics, says outside groups have spent 7.6 million on the race, much of it for McDaniel and against Cochran. 2014 midterms: Key races. Fighting back against tea party challenges. But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard. Henry Barbour, nephew of former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour, formed a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives to help Cochran. They have been airing aggressive ads slamming McDaniel as extreme, inconsistent and out of touch with Mississippi's needs. Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran, like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year. Still, Cochran's four decades in Washington have won him loyal supporters. On Memorial Day, Cochran attended an event in Vicksburg. He was invited by the Democratic mayor, George Flaggs, who called him a \\"mentor\\" and \\"great friend.\\" Flaggs told CNN he intends to vote for Cochran in the GOP primary since Mississippi law allows Democrats and others not registered as Republicans to participate. He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state. \\"He's a leader; he's a statesman, and he's what we need in Washington. So stay as long as he wants to stay,\\" Flagg said. Republican Briggs Hopson serves with McDaniel in the Mississippi state Senate, and told CNN he likes McDaniel but that Cochran is the \\"best person for Mississippi right now.\\" \\"Seniority can be a plus. People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran. He's been responsive to the needs in Mississippi for many years,\\" Hopson told CNN. 'Those days are over' When we put those bipartisan sentiments to McDaniel he responded with an emphatic, \\"come on!\\" \\"I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama. Name one time he's raised his voice in defense of conservatism. Name one time he's fought back the liberal agenda. Name one piece of legislation he's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause. Name one thing that he's been outwardly aggressive about. And they can't name one,\\" McDaniel told CNN. \\"Look, there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to Washington. Maybe when Richard Nixon was president that was the thing people did. Those days are over.\\" We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House. But Cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us. We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg, but when an aide came out and saw us waiting, they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him, while he snuck out another door and left in another car, leaving reporters in the dust. Special coverage: 2014 midterms. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses a highly contentious Republican primary in Mississippi, where conservative blogger and Tea Party activist Chris McDaniel is challenging long-time Senator Thad Cochran. The race, originally meant to focus on ideas within the GOP, has been marred by scandal and mudslinging, including allegations that a McDaniel supporter broke into a nursing home to photograph Cochran's ailing wife. McDaniel's campaign has denied any involvement in this affair and both candidates are backed by significant outside funding. McDaniel aims to be the next Ted Cruz, a staunch conservative unwilling to compromise, while Cochran's long Senate tenure has earned him a great deal of loyalty and support in Mississippi.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more space rock in space happens, how will it affect the space in the rock gets bigger.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given process The original process describes the formation of a cave from water seeping into the ground, interacting with the rock, and gradually carving a cavern as more water rushes through. Process: 1. Water seeps below the soil surface 2. Water comes into contact with rock 3. Rock gets eroded and carved by water over time 4. Space in rock becomes larger and forms a cave 5. As more water rushes through, the cave becomes a cavern Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis states that there is more space rock in space, and questions how it will affect the space in the rock getting bigger. Step 3: Analyze if the perturbation affects the process (directly or indirectly) A. Water seeping below the soil surface The presence of more space rock in space does not directly or indirectly affect the water seeping below the soil surface. Water seepage depends on factors like rainfall and soil porosity, which are not influenced by space rocks. B. Water comes into contact with rock Having more space rock in space does not impact the water coming into contact with the rock below the soil. This interaction depends on the depth and composition of the rock layer, which is not related to space rocks. C. Rock gets eroded and carved by water over time While space rock might affect Earth's overall geological processes, its effect on the local erosion and carving of a specific rock is negligible. The influence of space rocks on Earth's rock erosion is inconsequential compared to the primary factors that cause erosion, such as water and wind. D. Space in rock becomes larger and forms a cave and a cavern The presence or increase of space rocks in space will not have a direct or indirect effect on the formation of caves and caverns. These formations depend on the local geological conditions, such as the type of rock, water flow, and time, which are not affected by space rocks. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation (increase of space rocks in space) does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of water seeping into the ground, interacting with rocks, and forming caves and caverns.

Consequently, this would lead to an increased interest from the developing country responsible for delivering these generic products. The developing country would recognize the importance of its role in providing affordable access to essential goods and might be encouraged to invest efforts into this area. The supply of generic products is crucial in many developing countries to ensure that people can access what they need at more affordable prices. Generic products, particularly in the fields of pharmaceuticals and healthcare, can enable governments to provide necessary treatments and resources to disadvantaged populations. This, in turn, can have a significant impact on public health and socioeconomic well-being of the country. The rise of interest in providing generic products from the developing country may lead to several potential outcomes. The country might dedicate more resources to local production, invest in capacity building, and form external partnerships and collaborations to facilitate the availability of these products. In the long run, this could contribute to the country's economic growth and provide additional opportunities to improve the living conditions of its population. Furthermore, the increased focus on the production and delivery of generic products could improve the country's global standing and its ability to negotiate more favorable terms of trade with international partners. This might lead to beneficial alliances and cooperation with other countries that share similar goals and objectives. In conclusion, retaining the option for the supply of generic products in a developing country would undoubtedly generate considerable interest, particularly if the country sees the benefits associated with such a task. This interest could foster significant positive changes in terms of affordability, accessibility, and overall development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Mystic River Movie plot: In 1975, three children - Jimmy, Sean, and Dave - are playing on the streets of Boston when a stranger approaches them. Since the stranger has a badge and is wearing a suit, the children assume that he is a police officer. The stranger orders Dave to enter his car, and Dave obeys. The men lock him inside a basement and sexually abuse him for four days, after which he manages to escape. Twenty-eight years later, the boys are grown and still live in Boston, but they are no longer close friends. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-convict running a neighborhood store, while Dave (Tim Robbins) is a blue-collar worker. The two are still neighbors and related by marriage. Sean (Kevin Bacon) has become a detective with the Massachusetts State Police. Several months prior, his wife left him before having their child but his wife still sometimes calls him without saying a word. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) visits him at the store he owns, and tells her father she will be going out that Saturday night with her friends. Jimmy mentions that the next day is her sister's communion, and as she leaves it is revealed she is secretly dating a boy named Brendan (Tom Guiry), and they reference plans they have for the next day. That night Dave is at a bar where Katie happens to also show up with her friends; Katie and her friends dance on the bar top to the music but Dave continues to watch the TV at the bar. Dave comes home at 3am Sunday morning with an injured hand and blood on his clothes, which his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) helps him clean, but immediately notices inconsistencies in his story. Dave claims that he fought against a mugger and may have killed him. Katie's car is found on the street in the early morning after a call to emergency services; and Katie doesn't show up the next morning for work. Jimmy attends a Sunday morning church service with his family and some neighborhood tough guys that are former associates, and Jimmy grows more concerned because Katie still hasn't shown up.

However, I can still offer some insight on the movie \\"Mystic River,\\" which you provided a detailed plot summary for. In the movie \\"Mystic River,\\" directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, the main suspects and individuals involved with the investigation are: 1. Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): As you mentioned in the plot summary, Dave comes home one night with blood on his clothes and an injured hand. His wife, Celeste, notices inconsistencies in his story about fighting a mugger. Due to this suspicious behavior and his history of childhood trauma, Dave becomes a primary suspect in Katie's murder. 2. Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry): Brendan is secretly dating Katie, which makes him a possible suspect as well. The police might investigate him as a potential suspect in the case, especially if they discover that they had secret plans the day after Katie's disappearance. 3. Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): Although Jimmy is Katie's father, his criminal background and connections to former associates in crime could bring up suspicions about his potential involvement in the murder. 4. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): As a detective working on the case, Sean may find himself suspected by his colleagues, especially if they learn about his strained relationship with his wife. They may question whether his personal life is affecting his judgement and the integrity of the investigation. In general, when assessing the investment potential for a film proposal, it is crucial to consider various factors. These factors include the screenplay's quality, the film's genre and potential audience appeal, the production's budget, the attached talent (including actors, director, and producers), and the distribution strategy. Based on the critical and commercial success of the film \\"Mystic River,\\" a proposal for a similar project might have potential as a worthwhile investment.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

If \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\", can we conclude \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\" based on the given statement, \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\" The reason is that these are two entirely different activities and contexts. Let's analyze both situations in detail to understand why we cannot reach this conclusion. 1. Two women playing field hockey Field hockey is an outdoor team sport played on a grass or turf field, with the objective of scoring goals by hitting or pushing a small ball using a hook-shaped stick. The involvement of two women in this activity implies that they are both participating in a field hockey match or practice. It could be a professional game, a recreational event, or a friendly match among friends. In this scenario, we can infer several aspects: - The two women are most likely wearing appropriate clothing, such as shorts, a sports shirt, and protective gear like shin guards and mouthguards. - They are using field hockey sticks, specifically designed for this sport, and playing with a ball. - They are likely following the rules of field hockey, which dictate how the game is played, including team size, field markings, and goal-scoring requirements. - The level of physical activity for both women might be moderate to high, as field hockey involves constant running, maneuvering, and competing against opposing team members. 2. Two women swimming in the ocean Swimming in the ocean suggests a recreational or leisure activity wherein the two women might be having a relaxing time in the sea, swimming, and enjoying the water. It could also be that they are practicing their swimming skills or engaging in water sports like surfing, snorkeling, or scuba diving. In any case, the context is very distinct from playing field hockey. Some aspects we can infer from this scenario: - The women are likely wearing appropriate swimwear (e.g., swimsuits or wetsuits), depending on the specific activity and water temperature. - Their purpose for swimming can range from exercise to relaxation or even learning a new water-based skill. - The activity level might differ significantly from playing field hockey, as swimming involves various techniques and levels of physical exertion.

Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year.

Article: Thousands of cities around the globe turned off their lights for an hour to mark Earth Hour 2014, a symbolic show of support for the environment organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature.  Since the movement began in Sydney, Australia, in 2007, it has spread to more than 7,000 cities across more than 160 countries. Singapore continues to hold one of the world's largest lights-off events, drawing around 9,000 people this year to Marina Bay Sands, a commercial center typically awash in electricity.  To mark the event actors Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Emma Stone and a group of other famous stars from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie were in town.  Other iconic landmarks that fell dark included the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok's Wat Arun temple, the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Sydney Opera House, Red Square in Moscow, the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Hong Kong Harbor.       As the movement has grown, more organizations and business have committed to switching off their lights in support of efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. In Singapore, at least 600 organizations and companies agreed to either switch off their lights or participate in movements to use fewer plastic bags, take shorter showers, turn up their air-conditioning units or switch to LED lighting.  This year the World Wide Fund for Nature, which first launched worldwide Earth Hour, also launched Earth Hour Blue, a crowdfunding platform aimed at raising money for environmental projects around the globe.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation 3129*c = -5233*c + 1061974 for c, we will first add the terms with c on one side of the equation and isolate the term without c on the other side. Here are the steps to do that: Step 1: Add 5233*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate the c term from the right side: 3129*c + 5233*c = -5233*c + 5233*c + 1061974 8362*c = 1061974 Step 2: Now, we have an equation in the form of Ac = B, where A = 8362 and B = 1061974. To find the value of c, we will simply divide both sides of the equation by A (8362): c = 1061974 / 8362 By performing the division, we get: c ≈ 126.894 (rounded to three decimal places) So, the solution to the equation 3129*c = -5233*c + 1061974 is c ≈ 126.894."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Process:  - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more copper wire is wound happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis proposed states that more copper wire is wound around the core of the electromagnet, and we'd like to determine if this perturbation would have a direct or indirect effect on the overall process by leading to a stronger electromagnet. To reiterate, the process of creating an electromagnet involves: 1. A conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal, typically an iron or steel core. 2. An electrical current is introduced to the copper wire from a power source. 3. This current flows through the wire, producing a magnetic field within the wire and in the vicinity of the metal core. 4. The metal core becomes magnetized due to this magnetic field. 5. When the current is turned off, the metal core loses its magnetism. Now, let's analyze the proposed perturbation of increasing the amount of copper wire wound around the core and its potential effects on the process. A stronger electromagnet can be achieved by amplifying one or more factors that contribute to the strength of its magnetic field. There are three main factors: 1. The amount of current flowing through the wire. 2. The number of turns (loops) of the wire around the metal core. 3. The type of material used as the metal core. The perturbation hypothesis focuses on the second factor – the number of turns of copper wire around the metal core. By increasing the number of turns of wire, the resulting magnetic field created in and around the wire will be cumulatively stronger. This is because each turn of wire contributes to the overall magnetic field, and as more turns are added, the magnetic field lines become denser within the metal core. As a result, the core becomes more strongly magnetized. Hence, the proposed perturbation indeed has a direct effect on the process of creating an electromagnet. Increasing the amount of copper wire wound around the core, and consequently the number of turns, will lead to a stronger magnetic field. This, in turn, will create a stronger electromagnet as more of the metal core material becomes influenced by the enhanced magnetic field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Urdu/Punjabi: myN mHmd nwz shryf, born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani businessman and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2013 until he was disqualified for life from office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2017. He had previously served as the Prime Minister twice in the 90s (1990-93 and 1997-99) and the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. He is Pakistan's longest-serving prime minister. Born into the upper-middle class Sharif family in Lahore, he is the son of Ittefaq and Sharif Group founder, Muhammad Sharif, and the elder-brother of three-time elected Punjab Chief Minister, Shehbaz. On 7 November 1990, the newly elected prime minister announced his nuclear policy and in public television, Sharif responded that: \\"The peaceful [atomic] programme of which... it would be accelerated to accommodate growing [nuclear] [e]nergy needs and to make up for rising [oil] prices. And, of course, (Pakistan) will to construct new nuclear power plants.\\" On 26 November, Sharif authorised talks with the US to solve the nuclear crises after the US had tightened its embargo on Pakistan, prompting Sharif to send his government's Treasure Minister Sartaj Aziz to held talks on Washington. It was widely reported in Pakistan that the US Assistant Secretary of State Teresita Schaffer had told the Foreign Minister Shahabzada Yaqub Khan to halt the uranium enrichment programme.  In December, France's Commissariat a l'energie atomique agreed to provide a commercial 900MW power plant, but plans did not materialise as France wanted Pakistan to provide entire financial funds for the plant. On December, the financial embargo was placed and the country's economy felt a distress that prompted Sharif to replace his Treasure minister. Sharif then used Munir Ahmad Khan to have convinced IAEA to allow Pakistan for a nuclear plant in Chashman where Khan intensively lobbied in IAEA for the nuclear power plant. In December 1990, IAEA allowed Pakistan to established CHASNUPP-I, signed with China; the IAEA also gave approval of upgrading of the KANUPP-I in 1990. During his first term, Sharif intensified his non-nuclear weapon policy and strictly followed the policy of deliberate nuclear ambiguity which was also continued by Benazir as well. Responding to US embargo, Sharif publicly announced that: \\"Pakistan possessed no [atomic] bomb... Pakistan would be happy to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) but it must be provided \\"first\\" to India to do the same.\\"  Sharif intensified his move to enhance the Pakistan's integrated nuclear development and authorised projects that seemed to be important in his point of views. Sharif also promoted the peaceful nuclear energy programme, and signed the CHASNUPP-I reactor with People's Republic of China for the commercial electricity use. Sharif also responded to use the nuclear development in more of economical usage, benefited for the country's economy and its extension to the civil society. His policies to make the nuclear program for economical use was also continued by Benazir Bhutto and Pervez Musharraf.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? its sheer dynamism","output":"The phrase \\"its sheer dynamism\\" can generally be considered as positive, but its precise meaning depends heavily on the context in which it is used. To analyze the phrase, let's break it down into two main components: \\"sheer\\" and \\"dynamism.\\" 1. Sheer: Sheer is an adjective usually used to emphasize the degree or extent of a particular quality. In this instance, it accentuates the level of dynamism. It can convey the sense of something being pure, intense, or extreme, implying that there is no ambiguity or doubt about the level of dynamism being described. 2. Dynamism: Dynamism is a noun that refers to the quality of being dynamic, energetic, forceful, or vigorous. It suggests active change, progress, and growth. It is often associated with powerful movement, innovation, and forward-thinking approaches. Now, combining these two components, we can see that \\"its sheer dynamism\\" refers to an almost unadulterated or intense degree of energy, activity, and progress. This association with intense force and enthusiasm is generally seen as positive due to the implication of success, growth, and accomplishment. The phrase suggests that the subject (denoted by \\"its\\") is remarkable and deserving of attention and praise based on its strong dynamic qualities. However, context plays a crucial role in determining whether the phrase will be regarded as positive or negative. In situations where the energy and vigor are seen as desirable traits, the phrase will be viewed positively. For example, when describing a thriving business environment or a captivating work of art, \\"its sheer dynamism\\" would likely be perceived as an attribute contributing to the subject's appeal and success. On the other hand, if the intense level of activity and forcefulness are perceived as harmful, chaotic, or overwhelming, the phrase could take on a negative connotation. For instance, if the description relates to an unmanageable workload or a volatile social situation, the phrase might not be viewed as entirely positive due to the possible negative effects of such excessive energy. In conclusion, \\"its sheer dynamism\\" can generally be considered a positive phrase as it highlights exceptional energy, progress, and activity. However, it is essential to pay attention to the context and subject in question, as the precise interpretation may differ based on the situation and desired outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a civil war between the mining company, known as the New Economic Bloc (NEB), and the Alliance, a group of former mining and science personnel. Five years into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous Mobile Swords (AMS) â artificially intelligent self-replicating machines that hunt down and kill NEB soldiers on their own. They are nicknamed \\"screamers\\" because of a high-pitched noise they emit as they attack. Screamers track targets by their heartbeats, so Alliance soldiers wear \\"tabs\\" which broadcast a signal canceling out the wearer's heartbeat and rendering them \\"invisible\\" to the machines. A fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly supplied, and undermanned armies. A message guaranteeing safe passage through NEB territory to discuss a truce is recovered from a dead NEB soldier, killed by screamers as he approached the Alliance compound. When Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson (Weller) reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, he is told that such a meeting won't be necessary; peace negotiations are already underway on Earth. Not true, says Private \\"Ace\\" Jefferson (Andrew Lauer), newly arrived from Earth. Hendricksson is not surprised, as he suspects that both sides have simply written off Sirius 6B and abandoned their armies. Hendricksson decides that the only realistic chance of survival for himself and his soldiers is to accept the NEB truce offer. He sets out for a meeting with the NEB commander, accompanied by Jefferson. While traveling through a destroyed city they come upon a war orphan, a young boy named David (Michael Caloz), clutching a teddy bear. Unwilling to abandon a defenseless civilian, they bring the boy along. The following night they are attacked by a reptilian screamer that they have never before encountered.

Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun.

Q: Sentence: In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \\"a very agreeable day\\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \\"a perfect musician\\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.  Question: Where were Frédéric's parents located at when he saw them for the final time in 1835?

Teen self-harmed after Vic prison transfer A juvenile offender harmed himself after he was sent to a Victorian adult maximum security prison before it was ready to house children. Lawyers for 12 youth offenders are challenging the state government's decision to transfer them to Barwon maximum security prison after riots at two youth detention facilities. The teens are among a group of offenders as young as 16 transferred to the Grevillea unit within Barwon prison in November after riots damaged the Malmsbury and Parkville youth detention facilities. One of the 40 teens transferred to the Grevillea unit used a piece of equipment to self-harm before authorities had finished removing items of risk, the Victorian Supreme Court heard on Tuesday. These items are still being removed, a Department of Health and Human Services manager says. Grevillea is being operated as a youth remand centre and youth justice custodial centre by the DHHS. The department's director of secure services, Ian Lanyon, admitted issues with Grevillea's facilities have resulted in behavioural problems. \\"There were some infrastructure issues at Grevillea that had meant that some clients' behaviour had escalated,\\" he told the trial. Mr Lanyon confirmed access to sunlight and recreational areas were temporarily restricted while renovations to the unit's facilities were completed. Some juveniles were in lockdown for 23 hours a day, or spent more time inside their cells than outside them. Several of the 40 youths who were transferred to Grevillea are accused of being ringleaders in the Malmsbury and Parkville riots. None have been found guilty of rioting charges, and all the youths are on remand for other alleged offences. Mr Lanyon said he did not speak to the juveniles about their transfer, or to their lawyers. Matthew Belleville, who signed off on the group's transfer, told the court he had never been to Grevillea. \\"The basis on which I thought they should be transferred was that they had engaged in rioting behaviour,\\" the acting general manager of the Parkville youth justice facility said. Mr Belleville also said he was unaware the teens had been warned they would be met with capsicum spray, tear gas, firearms and dogs if they acted up. Counsel for the youths, Brian Walters QC, said the teens had received a note warning them that \\"any violent, dangerous or destructive behaviour, including property damage\\" could result in intervention from Barwon prison's riot squad. The Human Rights Law Centre and the Fitzroy Legal Service say Barwon prison is no place for children because they cannot access the educational or rehabilitation programs usually provided in youth detention. The trial before Justice Greg Garde will resume on Wednesday.

'' at the door , sybel turned to me one last time and said , \`\` i 'm glad you made it back . i really am . but you 'll find it 's changed out there . it 's no longer the same place . '' \`\` what do you mean , it 's","output":"changed?'' I asked, my curiosity piqued by Sybel's statement. She sighed and looked at me with a mixture of sadness and concern. \`\`Well, where do I start?'' she mused, as she leaned against the door frame. \`\`The world you remember has been altered in many ways. The passage of time, coupled with the events that have taken place while you were away, has caused a shift in the social, political, and economic landscape. People's perspectives and priorities have evolved, and with that, the world has transformed into something quite different from the one you knew before.'' I furrowed my brow in confusion, trying to imagine what could have caused such a metamorphosis. Sybel took a deep breath and continued. \`\`First, the political landscape has altered drastically. Long-standing alliances have crumbled, and new powers have emerged to fill the vacuum left behind. Conflicts between nations have given rise to social unrest, with many people displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in different parts of the world. This has led to a rise in nationalism and xenophobia, as well as increased division within societies.'' \`\`On the other hand, there are also movements focused on unity and cooperation – those who believe in the power of community and solidarity to overcome the many challenges that the world faces. This struggle between opposing ideologies has created a vastly different political climate than the one you remember.'' I listened intently, trying to absorb the enormity of these events. Sybel gave me a moment before continuing. \`\`Economically, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. Technological advancements have brought about an automation revolution, changing the job market and displacing many workers. This has led to fierce competition for careers and resources, further dividing societies on the basis of wealth and privilege.'' \`\`In many parts of the world, people struggle to access basic necessities like clean water, food, and shelter, while others enjoy lavish lifestyles. This disparity has given rise to social movements that challenge the status quo, seeking to redistribute wealth and establish more equitable systems.'' I could see the weight of these words on her face, the disappointment and frustration she felt with these developments. She pressed on. \`\`The environment has also suffered immensely. Climate change is an ever-present threat, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly common. Disappearing ice caps, rising sea levels, and devastating natural disasters have taken their toll on the world population and ecosystems alike.'' \`\`There are many who have recognized the need for urgent action and are working tirelessly to combat climate change, preserve endangered species and habitats, and promote a more sustainable way of life. But still, there are others who deny the reality of our global crisis, obstructing meaningful change and perpetuating the destructive status quo.'' Sybel paused, her expression a combination of disappointment and determination. She locked her gaze with mine. \`\`It's a lot to take in, I know. The world you return to may not be the same one you left behind, but it's important to remember that with change comes opportunity. There is still beauty, hope, and inspiration out there – it's up to us to seek it, embrace it, and use it to make a difference in our lives and those of others.'' \`\`So, while the world has indeed changed, so, too, can we adapt and contribute to a brighter future. It's up to you to find your place in this new world and be part of the change you wish to see.'' With that, Sybel smiled softly, offering me both encouragement and comfort in the face of such overwhelming revelations. She stepped back from the door, nodding for me to step out and embrace this transformed world. And as I ventured forth, I took her words to heart, vowing to make a difference, no matter how small, in a world that was no longer the same, but still brimming with possibilities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up an an NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky. Hours earlier, Kentucky defeated Louisville in its own semifinal. The Wildcats and the Jayhawks will play Monday night for the title at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. Both teams squared off earlier in the year with Kentucky pulling off a 75-65 win. Under coach John Calipari, Kentucky posted a 32-2 record over the course of this season -- with its only losses coming at the hands of Indiana and Vanderbilt, the latter coming in the Southeastern Conference tourney. It entered the 68-team NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South bracket, and the favorite to win it all in the eyes of many pundits. The team was led by Anthony Davis, a freshman who was recently named the Associated Press college basketball player of the year. But a win in Saturday's contest against Kentucky's in-state rival, Louisville, was hardly a given. The Cardinals, for one, had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino, who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky. Louisville entered the NCAAs with momentum after winning the Big East Tournament. The Cardinals battled the Wildcats tough throughout Saturday's game, tying the score, 49-49, at one point early in the second half. But the Wildcats eventually pulled away, winning by a 69-61 margin. Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No. 2 seeds, having both defeated the top seeds in their brackets -- Syracuse and North Carolina, respectively -- in the Elite Eight. The Jayhawks were paced by forward Thomas Robinson, this season's lone unanimous AP All-American pick. On the other side of the court was the Buckeyes' Jared Sullinger, who himself earned first-team honors for the second straight year. On Saturday night, Ohio State jumped ahead early, carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half. But Kansas stormed back after the intermission, notching the game up at 38-38 with 14 minutes left in the game. The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes. Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on, thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call, for a 64-62 victory. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The University of Kansas men's basketball team won a close game against Ohio State, and will play in the championship game against Kentucky. Kentucky had earlier won a game against Louisville. Both Kansas and Kentucky are very good teams with talented players.

Please answer the following question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Why did the narrator try to flip off the camera?  A. He didn't like the company that made the cameras  B. not enough information  C. He was trying to create a distraction  D. He realized that Dylan was not letting him in A:","output":"D. He realized that Dylan was not letting him in The narrator tried to flip off the camera because he realized that his refusal of entry into the art party was not just due to the doorman's decision, but in fact Dylan Maxwell, who was likely watching through the surveillance camera. The doorman's earpiece and the narrator's glance back to the surveillance camera led him to conclude that Dylan was the one pulling the strings behind the scene, and that's why he raised both arms to flip off the camera. His anger and frustration in this situation were directed at Dylan, as evidenced by his exclamation \\"Motherfucker\\" when he put the pieces together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They rang louder when a title card referred to America's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners). Jesse James -- thief, slave-holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy. How dishonest is this movie? There is NO mention of slavery, far less of the documented fact that Jesse James's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery. According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that's ALL. (Missouri: It's a candy mint! It's a breath mint!) Black people are entirely absent from this movie, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of whom wears a \\"HELP THE POOR\\" sign that's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten. (Some shots of 19th-century newspapers are inaccurate too, with 20th-century type fonts.) This film has a weird flashback structure. There's some very impressive stunt riding (and some fine work by stunt horses), and one excellent montage. I savoured one line of dialogue: 'Some of those boys will never taste beans again.' The movie gets a few facts straight: Agnes Moorehead, as Jesse's mother, conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton (here called 'Remington') in which Jesse James's real-life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm. Some errors here are pardonable: during his bushwhacking days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) does not have a stumpfinger. I've seen a photo of Jesse James's real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more. There's plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles. But many of this movie's errors were avoidable. Jesse James's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all the actors mispronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two-storey house (where he will soon die) after paying a rent of 18. Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting for 14. There was no upper storey ... so, when Jesse James is killed, his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here. (She was actually in the kitchen.) One continuity error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished. The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates. Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday. The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang (7 September, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James's birthday. (Maybe he meant next year's birthday.) Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881 ... so this scene should *BE* on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely avoidable. Some of the fictionalisations here don't make sense. According to this movie, the Northfield bank raid failed because one (fictional) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires. If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gang's getaway ... but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons. There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, normally an under-rated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, he can't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie ... so he doesn't much bother. John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping-up. Jesse James was no Robin Hood. (I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that's another story.) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family. After some of his hold-ups, he didn't even split the swag with the rest of his gang. In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever. In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank. As preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who (in the inaccurate legends) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse. I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol-durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes. 'The True (not much!) Story of Jesse James' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer, and likewise dishonest about the Civil War. For the very impressive stunt work, one good montage and a few fine acting turns, I'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10.","output":"The correct sentiment for this text is: - negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  and the situation: John and Keith were playing football - the game was rough to say the least. They both got hurt. After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation.  Answer the following question: Who would have dilated blood vessels near the wound, John or Keith? Answer:","output":"John would have dilated blood vessels near the wound. This is because he has inflammation, which is the body's response to infection or injury. The chemicals released during inflammation cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand, increasing blood flow to the damaged area. This results in the area appearing red and warm. Since Keith does not have any inflammation, his blood vessels would not be dilated near any wound."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression.

The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways.

Kilpatrick told authorities who he was during his arrest, according to a video posted by the Martin County Sheriff's Office.      Kilpatrick was one of the 12 inmates who used peanut butter to cover a door number and tricked a young jailer at 6:30 p.m. Sunday night, Sheriff James Underwood said.      \\"Changing numbers on doors with peanut butter -- It may sound crazy, but these kinds of people are crazy like a fox.\\" Underwood said during a news conference on Monday. \\"He thought he was opening the cell door for this man to go in his cell, but in fact he opened up the outside door.\\"      The inmates then climbed up a 12-foot fence. Some of them were cut by the razor wire, but none of them were seriously injured. All of them met at an undisclosed location after the escape.      By Monday afternoon, 11 of the inmates were taken into custody thanks to the help of other inmates and multiple law enforcement agencies. The following six inmates were captured within 90 minutes of their escape when law enforcement went to the location where the inmates agreed to meet: John Richard Hunter, 26, Christopher Cole Spain, 18, Kristopher Keith Secrest, 20, Quadrekas Latoddrick Key, 21, Timothy Chaz Cooper, 28, and Steven Sanford Hartley, 27.      Five of them were captured over the next eight hours: Michael Adam MicGuff, 30, Steven Blake Lamb, 28, Christopher Michael Smith, 19, Larry Inman, 29, and Ethan Howard Pearl.      One of the inmates was recaptured in Townley, where the sheriff said a car was stolen. Two others were captured by deputies and Birmingham police at the Flying J off of Interstate 65. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Recently, 12 prisoners escaped from a jail in Alabama by using peanut butter to change the numbers above a door.

Step 1: Understand the context The premise mentions that the Gothic Cathedrale Sainte-Cecile was constructed following some struggles that took place around 1282. This information adds context to the time and motivation behind the cathedral's construction.  Step 2: Identify the style The premise describes the cathedral as \\"grandiose\\" and \\"Gothic.\\" The Gothic style is characterized by tall, delicate structures with pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, which contribute to an imposing appearance. The term \\"grandiose\\" further emphasizes the cathedral's imposing nature, as it means impressive, magnificent, or extravagant in style or appearance. Step 3: Consider the purpose As mentioned in the premise, the cathedral was built \\"to impress the citizens of Albi with the reasserted power of the church.\\" This suggests that the architects and builders intended the structure to have a significant impact on the community, supporting the idea that the cathedral is an imposing presence. Based on these steps and the information provided in the premise, it can be reasonably concluded that the hypothesis \\"The Cathedrale Sainte-Cecile is an imposing structure\\" is true. The cathedral's grandiose Gothic architecture and its purpose to signify the church's power both point to it being an imposing and impressive structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The incident occurred as their patrol was making its way through the city, carrying out its duties to maintain stability and security in the region. The sudden explosion, believed to have been caused by an improvised explosive device (IED), took the lives of two soldiers and left two others injured. The injured soldiers were immediately transported to a nearby medical facility, where they are currently receiving treatment for their injuries. British forces stationed in Basra are working in collaboration with Iraqi security forces to identify the perpetrators behind this heinous attack. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing. The attack has been met with widespread condemnation both at home and abroad. UK Prime Minister, expressing his condolences for the lives lost, also reiterated the British government's commitment to working with Iraqi authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, violence and instability have plagued the region. This recent tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing efforts to rebuild and improve security in areas affected by conflict. Despite progress in recent years, attacks targeting security forces continue to occur sporadically in the area, putting the lives of both military personnel and civilians at risk. British and Iraqi forces remain vigilant and dedicated to eliminating any remaining threats to the peace and security that both nations hope to achieve in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translate to Romanian","output":"Este tocmai pentru că sunt dificile că trebuie să continuăm să demonstrăm solidaritate. Înțelegerea și gestionarea situațiilor dificile este esențială pentru a menține pacea, armonia și bunăstarea în societate. Solidaritatea reprezintă empatia, compasiunea și ajutorul pe care îl oferim celorlalți în vremuri de dificultate. Fără solidaritate, putem permite ca frustrările și provocările să creeze diviziuni și să deterioreze conexiunile dintre oameni. Solidaritatea este importantă atât la nivel individual, cât și la nivel de comunitate sau național. La nivel individual, arătarea solidarității înseamnă să fim prezenți și să oferim sprijin emoțional și practic prietenilor și familiei noastre atunci când se confruntă cu situații dificile. La nivel de comunitate sau național, solidaritatea poate fi demonstrată prin acțiuni colective, cum ar fi protestele pașnice sau campaniile de strângere de fonduri, care susțin cauze și inițiative juste. De asemenea, este important să recunoaștem că solidaritatea nu este doar o reacție la dificultățile actuale, ci și o investiție într-un viitor mai bun pentru toți. Prin împărtășirea de resurse, de timp și de efort, lucrăm împreună pentru a construi o societate mai rezistentă și mai cooperantă, în care oamenii își pot rezolva diferendele în mod pașnic și just, fără a apela la violență sau la excluderea celorlalți. Solidaritatea ne permite să facem față unor probleme complexe și interconectate, cum ar fi inegalitatea economică, discriminarea sau schimbările climatice. De exemplu, măsurile de reducere a emisiilor de carbon pot fi dificil de implementat și implica sacrificii și compromisuri din partea tuturor. Cu toate acestea, prin colaborarea și arătând solidaritate, putem face față acestor crize globale și putem construi un viitor mai sustenabil și mai echitabil pentru generațiile viitoare. În concluzie, este esențial să continuăm să arătăm solidaritate în fața dificultăților, chiar și atunci când pare copleșitor sau inconfortabil. Solidaritatea nu numai că ne ajută să ne sprijinim reciproc în vremuri de criză, dar consolidă și fundamentul necesar pentru a asigura o societate prosperă și echitabilă. Prin colaborare și sprijin reciproc, putem depăși provocările complexe cu care ne confruntăm și să construim un viitor mai luminos și mai bun pentru toți."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Everything changed when his family was brutally murdered by a notorious criminal, Vincent \\"The Viper\\" Valente, who was also the kingpin of an underground crime syndicate. Jack was devastated and devastated, but the justice system failed him, as The Viper had his web spread throughout the city, manipulating law enforcement and the judicial system. Swearing revenge against Valente, Jack decided to quit his job as a lawyer and take matters into his own hands. He hoped that one day, his dual life would collide, ultimately leading to Valente's downfall. Jack pursued his childhood dream of becoming a professional baseball player, joining the struggling team, the Springfield Sluggers. Bound by his love for his family, Jack worked tirelessly to balance his new life as a baseball player while secretly gathering intelligence on The Viper's illicit operations. His dedication started to pay off as he infiltrated the crime syndicate's ranks by sharpening his skills on and off the field, uncovering a vast network of corrupt officials and criminals. As Jack became a rising star in the baseball world, he used his newfound fame as a platform to expose Valente's corruption. He slowly gained allies in his fight for justice, including a rookie journalist named Sarah, determined to expose the truth behind the syndicate's influence on the city.

Review title: Handle broke here too Product review: After a week, the spigot button on the handle fell apart and would no longer work. This teakettle is a piece of junk. Don't be fooled by a good price. Answer:","output":"The review described would more than likely significantly decrease the chances of buying the product for multiple reasons.  Firstly, the title itself hints at an issue with the product's handle, suggesting it's not an isolated case but a recurring problem as it says 'Handle broke here too'. This might make a potential customer think about product's quality control issues and the possibility that it is a design or manufacturing flaw that impacts many or all units of the product. Secondly, the main content of the review notes the issue of a main component of the product (the spigot button on the handle) falling apart after just a week of usage. This signifies poor durability and potentially poor materials used in production.  The user calls the teakettle 'a piece of junk'. This characterization is strong negative language and it emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product - length of usage versus the quick rate of depreciation. It also implies that the product failed to meet their expectations or the standards claimed by the manufacturer.  Lastly, the review ends with a warning to other prospective buyers to not be 'fooled by a good price'. This suggests that while the product might be priced attractively or competitively, the reviewer believes that the value for money is not there due to the issues with quality and durability. All of these points contribute towards creating a sense of distrust in the product's quality and decrease the likelihood of purchasing it. It's important to take note that this is based on one review so it could be a single negative instance in a sea of positives.

Mycenaean Greece, a period between approximately 1600-1100 BC, represents one of the early stages of Greek civilization. This period laid the foundation for many aspects of Greek culture, including religion and mythology. The Mycenaean people were heavily influenced by the earlier Minoan civilization, but their religion was also shaped by Indo-European belief systems and those of the surrounding regions. The Mycenaean religion, like those of later Greek antiquity, was polytheistic, which means they worshipped multiple gods and goddesses. One notable surviving aspect of Mycenaean heritage is the names of these gods and goddesses, which were passed down and incorporated into later religious systems, particularly the Olympian Pantheon. The Olympian Pantheon refers to the classical collection of the twelve principal gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. These deities held central roles in Greek religious beliefs and were considered to reside on Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece. The Olympian Pantheon was an important part of Greek religion, culture and literature, and its influence can still be observed in art and architecture around the world. In the sentence provided, three major figures of the Olympian Pantheon are mentioned: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Zeus was the king of the gods and the ruler of the sky. His brothers, Poseidon and Hades, governed the oceans and the underworld, respectively. These gods, among others, held significant roles in Greek religious practices and were believed to have the ability to influence the lives of ancient Greeks, thus demonstrating an ancestral tie. Other prominent figures from Mycenaean Greece who became part of the Olympian Pantheon include Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Demeter, Hermes, and Hestia. These gods and goddesses had various roles and responsibilities, and each one was associated with a unique set of customs, symbols, and rituals. In conclusion, the sentence provided gives a valid answer to the question about figures for the established religion that is based on ancestral ties. Mycenaean Greece's religious heritage has had a significant influence on later Greek mythology and the Olympian Pantheon, which played a crucial role in shaping Greek culture, traditions, and belief systems. Among the mentioned figures are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, as well as many other gods and goddesses of divine lineage, emphasizing the ancestral connections and traditions that comprise the roots of Greek mythology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"In China, the traditional colour of a wedding dress is red. This vibrant and auspicious colour holds deep cultural and historical significance within Chinese society and is believed to bring luck, joy, and prosperity to the couple's life. In Chinese culture, red not only represents love and fertility, but also wards off evil spirits, making it the ideal choice for celebrating such an important and meaningful occasion as a wedding. The history of red wedding dresses in China dates back to the earliest dynasties when the colour was associated with virtues of loyalty, honour, and righteousness. Over the years, as different empires ruled over China and transformed the country, the symbolism and importance of the colour red persisted, further embedding itself into the customs and practices of the Chinese people. During traditional Chinese weddings, brides usually wear a long-sleeved gown known as a qipao or cheongsam. This dress is made from silk and is intricately embroidered with various symbols and patterns, such as dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and other auspicious elements, typically in gold and silver thread. These designs represent the balance and harmony of the bride and groom's union, as well as their wishes for a happy and prosperous life together. The qipao is also typically adorned with beads, sequins, or pearls to amplify its elegance and formality. Traditionally, the bride's hair is also ornamented with a red headpiece or veil known as a xiape, which conceals her face until the groom lifts it during the wedding ceremony. This act symbolizes the beginning of their life together and the unveiling of their love, respect, and commitment to each other. It is also common for Chinese brides to wear multiple outfits during the day of the wedding. After wearing the red dress for the traditional wedding ceremony, some brides may change into a white Western wedding dress for the reception or more formal dinner. This change reflects the cultural shift due to globalization and often symbolizes a blending of the traditional Chinese and contemporary Western customs and values. Lastly, out of respect for their families, many Chinese couples pay homage to their ancestors by participating in a tea ceremony, during which they usually don traditional Chinese red wedding attire. The tea ceremony involves the couple serving tea to their parents, grandparents, and sometimes other relatives as a sign of gratitude for their guidance and support. In conclusion, the traditional colour of a wedding dress in China is red, symbolizing good fortune, love, and protection against evil. Today, the use of red wedding dresses remains a popular and meaningful custom for many Chinese brides, helping to maintain and preserve the rich cultural heritage and values of the Chinese community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What city contained the Antonia Fortress?, using the article: The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The city that contained the Antonia Fortress is Jerusalem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Botulism affects the nervous system.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what does botulism affect?\\" with the following options:  - humans  - the skin  - plants  - our planet  - neurons  - people  - insects  - animals Answer:","output":"Botulism affects neurons in the nervous system. Before providing a comprehensive answer, let us first delve deeper into both facts. Fact 1: Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system.  Neurons are specialized cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They form the fundamental building blocks of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, gaps between adjacent neurons where electrical or chemical signals are exchanged. These signals, otherwise known as nerve impulses, facilitate the regulation of various body functions such as muscle movement, digestion, and the processing of thoughts and memories. Fact 2: Botulism affects the nervous system. Botulism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. These toxins are among the most powerful known to science and interfere with the normal functioning of the nervous system. Specifically, they block the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is crucial for nerve impulse transmission at the neuromuscular junction. When the release of acetylcholine is hindered, it leads to muscle paralysis and, in severe cases, respiratory failure and death. Now, let us examine each of the given options to understand how botulism interacts with them: - Humans: Botulism affects humans by targeting their neurons, leading to potentially severe nervous system impairments. - The skin: Botulism does not directly affect the skin; its primary target is the nervous system, resulting in muscle paralysis and other complications. - Plants: Botulism does not affect plants as its toxins specifically target the nervous system, which plants lack. - Our planet: Botulism has no direct impact on the planet as a whole. However, it can pose a significant health threat to humans, resulting in localized or individual consequences. - Neurons: Botulism directly affects neurons by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a critical neurotransmitter necessary for nerve impulse transmission. - People: Similar to humans, botulism affects people by interfering with the functioning of their nervous systems. - Insects: Although botulism primarily affects humans and animals, insects can act as vectors in transmitting Clostridium botulinum spores and toxins to human food sources. - Animals: Some animals, such as birds and mammals, can also be affected by botulism. It primarily impacts their nervous systems, just as it does in humans. Given these details, we can conclude that botulism affects neurons, which are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. By targeting neurons and blocking neurotransmitter release, botulism causes potentially life-threatening impairments in the affected individual's nervous system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information:  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - Thyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses.  The most common variety is \\"Thymus vulgaris\\". Thyme is of the genus \\"Thymus\\" of the mint family (Lamiaceae), and a relative of the oregano genus \\"Origanum\\".  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

It is indigenous to Ethiopia, where it is grown for its edible tubers. The tubers are cooked before they are eaten.  - Salvia hispanica, commonly known as chia, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. The sixteenth-century \\"Codex Mendoza\\" provides evidence that it was cultivated by the Aztec in pre-Columbian times and economic historians say it may have been as important as maize as a food crop. It was given as an annual tribute by the people to the rulers in 21 of the 38 Aztec provincial states.  - Marjoram (\\"Origanum majorana\\", syn. \\"Majorana hortensis\\" Moench, \\"Majorana majorana\\" (L.) H. Karst) is a somewhat cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavors. In some Middle Eastern countries, marjoram is synonymous with oregano, and there the names sweet marjoram and knotted marjoram are used to distinguish it from other plants of the genus \\"Origanum\\".

It is native to temperate western and southwestern Eurasia and the Mediterranean region.  - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.  - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

It is indigenous to Africa, where it is grown for its edible tubers. It is more difficult to cultivate than \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", but able to give greater yields. Although the crop is similar to a potato it is from the mint family but it is still quite nutritious and useful. This crop can benefit many subsistence farmers since it is native, easy to grow, growing popularity in the market and quite nutritious.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France.

Answer:","output":"Barry should expect that the electrical current will display more resistance with his new, thinner wires compared to his older, thicker ones. The reason is that the resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. Thinner wires have a smaller cross-sectional area, leading to higher resistance, while thicker wires have a larger cross-sectional area, resulting in lower resistance.

Information:  - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.  - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . ''  - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.    What entity does 'irises ' has the relation 'material used' with?

Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Paragraph :  If there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped and the Earth will heat up.  Question:   Tony drives an SUV that contributes many greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Evan rides a scooter that contributes few greenhouses gases to the atmosphere. Who likely contributes less to the Earth heating up Tony or Evan? The answer to this question is:","output":"Evan likely contributes less to the Earth heating up than Tony based on the information provided in the paragraph. This conclusion can be drawn from understanding the impact of greenhouse gases on the atmospheric temperature and comparing the emissions produced by an SUV and a scooter. The paragraph informs us that if there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped, and the Earth will heat up as a result. Greenhouse gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, which is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, maintaining the Earth's average temperature. However, when the amounts of these gases increase, due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, the Earth's atmosphere captures more heat, resulting in global warming and climate change. Now, let's compare the vehicles driven by Tony and Evan. Tony drives an SUV, which is a large, fuel-consuming vehicle that emits more greenhouse gases when compared to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. SUVs usually have larger engines and weigh more than smaller cars, leading them to consume more fuel and release increased greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, Evan rides a scooter, which generally produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions due to its small size, lighter weight, and more efficient use of fuel. In conclusion, Evan, who rides a scooter, likely contributes less to the Earth heating up compared to Tony, who drives an SUV. This is because Evan's vehicle emits fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which corresponds to the reduced trapping of ultraviolet radiation and lesser heating of the Earth. By choosing a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation, Evan helps in reducing the overall impact of greenhouse gases and mitigates the effects of global warming and climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation?  Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","output":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation. This is because somatic mutations occur in the body cells of an organism and are not inherited by offspring.

On the other hand, Group A presented germline mutations, which occur in the sex cells, or gametes, and can be inherited by the offspring as these mutations are present in the resulting organism's DNA. Since germline mutations can be passed down to offspring, they have a higher likelihood of affecting the next generation compared to somatic mutations, which remain limited to the individual organism."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who, according a Village performer, \\"start[ed] singing ['Hard Rain']...finished singing it, and no one could say anything\\"?, using the article: Dylan was only 21 years old when he wrote one of his most complex songs, \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\", often referred to as \\"Hard Rain\\". Dylan is said to have premiered \\"Hard Rain\\" at the Gaslight Cafe, where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: \\"He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ['Hard Rain'] ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting\\". Dylan performed \\"Hard Rain\\" days later at Carnegie Hall on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by Pete Seeger. The song gained added resonance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, just one month after Dylan's first performance of \\"Hard Rain\\", when U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba, . Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to nuclear fallout, but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with Studs Terkel in 1963, Dylan said, \\"No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen … In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers.\\" Many people were astonished by the power and complexity of this work. For Robert Shelton, who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in The New York Times, this song was \\"a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, and Rexroth.\\" Folk singer Dave Van Ronk later commented: \\"I was acutely aware that it represented the beginning of an artistic revolution.\\" Pete Seeger expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan., what would be the answer ?

Since there's a subtraction on the right side of the equation, perform the arithmetic operation: 21 - 109 = -88 Now, the simplified equation becomes: -22*d = -88 Step 2: Solve for d. To solve this equation for d, you need to isolate the variable d on one side of the equation. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -22: (-22*d) / -22 = -88 / -22 This simplifies to: d = 4 So, the solution for the equation -22*d = 21 - 109 is d = 4."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Questions: What do ships other than cargo ships do when they are in the ocean? Options: - bottom out - cross ocean - collide - cross river - carry people The answer is:","output":"carry people Ship transportation has been prevalent throughout human history, playing a significant role in connecting various parts of the world. While cargo ships are predominantly used for carrying goods from one port to another, there are various other types of ships in the ocean with distinct purposes and functionalities. One such purpose is to transport people, which is why the option \\"carry people\\" aligns with common sense in answering the question. There are several types of ships designed specifically to carry people, including: 1. Passenger ships: These ships are specifically designed to transport people, typically offering a range of services and amenities for the comfort and convenience of passengers. Examples include cruise ships, ferries, and ocean liners. 2. Cruise ships: These large vessels are designed for leisure travel, providing hospitality and entertainment facilities on board to create a vacation-like atmosphere. Cruise ships usually have multiple destinations as part of a planned itinerary and can accommodate thousands of passengers. 3. Ferries: These ships are used to transport passengers, vehicles, and cargo across relatively short distances, such as across rivers or between coastal ports. They are an essential means of developing connectivity between islands and mainland coastal cities. 4. Ocean liners: These are large ships designed to carry passengers on long-distance voyages across oceans, operating on a schedule much like cargo ships. Ocean liners were the primary mode of long-distance passenger transportation before the growth of air travel. 5. Naval ships: Many navies across the world have ships designed to carry personnel for various purposes, such as military operations, humanitarian aid, or training missions. 6. Research vessels: Ships equipped for scientific research purposes, including geological, oceanographic, and marine biological exploration, have accommodations and facilities for scientists, researchers, and crew members. The other options presented are either not in line with common sense or do not pertain to the specific purpose of ships in the ocean other than cargo ships. \\"Bottom out\\" refers to a ship running aground or hitting shallow waters, which is undesirable. \\"Cross ocean\\" and \\"cross river\\" are general actions that may be performed by any ship, and \\"collide\\" refers to an accident that is not the intended function of a ship."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the below context:  James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? A:","output":"In classical theory, the gravitational pull between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. This relation is given by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects. Given the information in the paragraph, we can compare the gravitational pull of Earth and Asteroid A on an object. Since Rob detected that all of the asteroids (including Asteroid A) have less mass than Earth, we know that the mass of Earth (m1) is greater than the mass of Asteroid A (m2). Additionally, Asteroid A is farther from Earth than Asteroid B, meaning the distance between Earth and Asteroid A (rA) is greater than the distance between Earth and Asteroid B (rB). Even though we do not have the exact values for the masses and distances, we can conclude that Earth has a stronger gravitational pull on an object than Asteroid A based on the given information. First, let's compare the mass factor in the gravitational force formula. Since Earth's mass is greater than Asteroid A's mass (m1 > m2), this factor for Earth's gravitational pull will be stronger than that of Asteroid A. Next, consider the distance factor. Because Asteroid A is farther from Earth, the force of gravity between an object and Asteroid A would decrease due to the increased distance (rA > rB). This factor further implies that Earth's gravitational pull would be stronger. Combining the mass and distance factors in Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, it becomes evident that Earth's gravitational pull is stronger than that of Asteroid A. Thus, if Rob needs to find the object with a stronger gravitational pull in classical theory, he should choose Earth over Asteroid A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: Some Lexus ads are targeted toward rich people who like nice cars. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states that a Lexus ad in Car and Driver or Fortune (both magazines) is well targeted at affluent people who like fancy cars. This indicates that Lexus ads in these magazines are specifically aimed at wealthy individuals who appreciate luxury automobiles. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that some Lexus ads are targeted toward rich people who like nice cars. This implies there are certain Lexus ads that are created with the intention of appealing to a wealthy audience with a penchant for high-quality vehicles. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis touch upon Lexus ads that aim to reach an affluent audience with a preference for fancy or nice cars. The main difference is the specificity of the audience (magazine readers in the premise, unspecified in the hypothesis) and the level of targeting (well-targeted in the premise, simply targeted in the hypothesis). Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true – that a Lexus ad in Car and Driver or Fortune is well targeted at affluent people who like fancy cars – this subset of Lexus ads does indeed cater to the wealthy demographic mentioned in the hypothesis.

Russia has denied claims by Ukraine and Western reporters that military aid to the rebels has been crossing the border. More than 2,000 civilians and combatants have been killed since mid-April, when Ukraine's new government sent troops to put down an uprising by pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A huge humanitarian aid convoy from Russia is stalled on the Russian side of the border about two hours drive from Luhansk, apparently awaiting inspection by Ukrainian border guards. Red Cross official Pascal Cuttat said on Saturday there were still no security guarantees in place for his staff to escort the lorries, although \\"technical conditions\\" had been agreed with Ukraine and Russia for crossing the border. On Friday Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu assured his US counterpart Chuck Hagel that there were no Russian military personnel involved with the convoy, nor would it be used as a pretext for a Russian military intervention. Journalists who were invited to inspect some of the 280 or so vehicles on Friday found humanitarian aid inside but also noticed that some of the lorries were not full to capacity. Mr Zakharchenko, who became the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) last week, made the announcement to the rebels' parliament on Friday, with a video of his speech (in Russian) posted on YouTube. Littering the speech with military jargon, he said: \\"There are, at present, in the axis of the corridor [linking rebels in Donetsk with those in Luhansk and the Russian border] - there have been assembled -reserves of the following order: 150 units of military hardware of which about 30 are actual tanks and the rest are infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers, and 1,200 personnel who underwent four months of military training on the territory of the Russian Federation.\\" The rebel leader went on a Russian pro-Kremlin TV channel on Saturday to reject reports that the hardware had come from Russia. \\"The Ukrainian military have left us so much hardware that we can't find enough people to crew it - I mean tanks, troop carriers, Grad [multiple rocket] launchers and so on,\\" he told Life News (video in Russian). He added that \\"ethnic Ukrainian\\" volunteers from Russia, not servicemen, were fighting for the rebels, along with \\"Turks; a great many Serbs; Italians and Germans; and even two Romanians\\". Ukraine said on Friday it had partially destroyed an armoured column that had crossed from Russia on Thursday evening. Two UK newspaper reporters witnessed the alleged incursion. Russia's defence ministry responded by saying the incursion reports were \\"some kind of fantasy\\" and Moscow has consistently denied directly arming or training the rebels. But the incident prompted a flurry of Western condemnation. \\"Any unilateral military actions on the part of the Russian Federation in Ukraine under any pretext, including humanitarian, will be considered by the European Union as a blatant violation of international law,\\" a statement by EU foreign ministers issued on Friday says.

On Friday, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu reassured US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that there were no Russian military personnel involved with the convoy, and it would not be utilized as a pretext for Russian military intervention. In his speech, Zakharchenko mentioned that the rebels have assembled reserves of military hardware and 1,200 personnel trained on Russian territory. Despite this, the rebel leader argues that the hardware did not come from Russia but was left behind by Ukrainian forces. He claims that volunteers from various countries, including Russia, are fighting for the rebels, but they are not official servicemen. Regarding the alleged armored column that crossed from Russia into Ukraine, Moscow has denied these claims, calling them \\"some kind of fantasy.\\" The situation has prompted strong condemnation from Western nations. The European Union has warned that any unilateral military actions by Russia in Ukraine will be seen as a blatant violation of international law. German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the flow of military goods, advisers, and armed personnel across the border."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He won a gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics .  - A medal or medallion is, strictly speaking, a small, flat, and round (at times, ovoid) piece of metal that has been sculpted, molded, cast, struck, stamped, or some way marked with an insignia, portrait, or other artistic rendering. A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient.  - A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture.  - Hancock is a city in Houghton County, Michigan, United States and is located on Copper Island, which is part of the Keweenaw Peninsula, on the Keewenaw Waterway directly opposite Houghton, Michigan. The population was 4,634 at the 2010 census.  - Copper Island is a local name given to the northern part of the Keweenaw Peninsula (projecting northeastward into Lake Superior at the western end of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, United States of America), separated from the rest of the Keweenaw Peninsula by Portage Lake and the Keweenaw Waterway.  - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means.  - The 1960 Winter Olympics was a winter multi-sport event held between February 1828, 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States. Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each. Swedish cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the four medals he won at the 1956 Winter Games.

Article: (ALAUDDIN VALLEY) -- Russia's relationship with Tajikistan has  _ following an incident involving a Russian pilot who was arrested -- after making an emergency landing in the Central Asian nation. Russia responded by beginning to drive out Tajik guest workers, a move that threatens Tajikistan's entire economy. In total, some 700,000 Tajik citizens work in Russia. In the past quarter, they sent home some 742 million in remittances  . Overall, the money guest workers send back makes up half of the republic's government budget.  The Alauddin Valley is in the Fann Mountains in eastern Tajikistan. The place long held an attraction for Russian writers and adventurers. Later, during the Soviet era, it was a popular tourist destination. Yet establishing a strong relationship with the people of the mountainous region is not easy. Men are seldom seen in the area. Nearly every family has at least one breadwinner working in Russia, if not more. The farm work falls to the women, who divide it up among themselves. Each summer, the village chooses the most experienced and skilled women to take all of the cows (up to 300 of them) to the summer pastures   high up on in the mountains. The women spend four months there with their children since there is no one to leave the children with. They milk the cows and prepare products for the winter: cheese, butter and so on. These fermented   goods get them through the winter when snow and avalanches   cut off all contact with civilization.  Residents here generally have two questions for visiting Russians. The first one is obvious: Is President Dmitri Medvedev going to limit the entry of Tajik guest workers? The second question is less obvious: Are there cows in Moscow? The Alauddin Valley's women truly can't imagine life without either. Question: Why was the Russian pilot arrested? - Because he stole a plane in Tajikistan. - Because he didn't land in Tajikistan safely. - Because he landed in Tajikistan without permission. - Because he refused to return to Russian.","output":"The article does not provide the exact reason for the arrest, so it is not possible to definitively select the best answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea?  Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it...

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? , can you please find it?   In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States.  He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railroad workers to find out his whereabouts.

This event would signify the end of not just Earth, but the entire universe. As panic and chaos engulf the world, space agencies, governments, and scientists from all countries are forced to collaborate in an effort to prevent this catastrophic event. Our protagonist, Dr. Ada Lovelace, a renowned astrophysicist, recognizes the signal as a potential message, not merely a threat. She embarks on a quest to decipher the meaning of this cryptic message, believing it to hold the key to the survival of the universe. As governments and private space programs from around the world race against time to evacuate segments of humanity to a new potential safe haven, a planet known as Kepler-452b, a distant world that remains unaffected by the Luminous Entity, Ada forms an eclectic team of experts comprising of an ex-military strategist, a genius hacker, and an archaeologist who specializes in ancient civilizations. Together, Ada's team uncovers surprising evidence that the Luminous Entity is a cosmic phenomenon that was previously encountered by an ancient civilization that seemingly vanished from Earth several millennia ago. The ancient civilization had left behind a complex network of hidden artifacts and structures around the world, encoded with secrets to help humanity communicate with the Luminous Entity in order to save the universe from a repetitive cycle of destruction and creation. As humanity scrambles to chart its way to the stars and find a new home in Kepler-452b, Ada's team must decipher the ancient codes, unravel the mysteries surrounding the Luminous Entity, and ultimately confront the colossal cosmic being to plead for the existence of the universe. The climax of the movie sees the deciphering of the final message, unlocking an interstellar portal that allows the team to travel to the center of the Luminous Entity. As the cosmic being absorbs the knowledge and emotions of the human representatives, it acknowledges their determination to protect the universe. Empathizing with the resilience of humanity and its sincere desire to grow and evolve, the Luminous Entity halts the process of destruction. In the final act, as society is left to face the impact caused by panic and chaos on Earth, humanity turns a new leaf, having learned the importance of unity, cooperation, and the pursuit of knowledge. With the cosmic balance restored and the universe saved from destruction, the memory of the Luminous Entity lives on as a reminder of the power of compassion, unity, and the human spirit. The Last Radiance is a compelling story that blends cosmic forces and human emotions to explore the limits of human potential, the importance of solidarity, and the undying essence of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges"},{"instruction":"Given the question: What's the answer to that question: what has been discovered on mars so far?

Answer:","output":"Fritz Lang and Christophe Gans are not from the same country. They are both filmmakers known for their work in the cinema industry, but they come from different European countries. Fritz Lang, born Friedrich Christian Anton Lang, was an Austrian-German filmmaker who was born on December 5, 1890, in Vienna, Austria. Lang is considered one of the pioneers of German Expressionist cinema and directed several influential films during the early 20th century, including the groundbreaking science fiction epic, \\"Metropolis\\" (1927) and the crime thriller, \\"M\\" (1931). Lang's career spanned both the silent and sound eras in film. He later moved to the United States to escape the Nazi regime and continued working in Hollywood, where he directed film noirs and crime dramas such as \\"Scarlet Street\\" (1945) and \\"The Big Heat\\" (1953). On the other hand, Christophe Gans is a French film director, producer, and screenwriter. Born on March 11, 1960, in Antibes, France, Gans is particularly known for his work in the horror and fantasy genres. He made his feature directorial debut with the film \\"Crying Freeman\\" (1995), based on a Japanese manga. Gans gained international recognition with his work on the movie \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" (2001), a French historical action film with elements of horror and fantasy. He is also known for directing the film adaptation of the popular survival horror video game, \\"Silent Hill\\" (2006). While both filmmakers have had an impact on the cinema industry and the genres in which they've worked, they are from different countries and cultural backgrounds, with Lang hailing from Austria and Gans from France. Their filmmaking styles and subject matter are reflective of their individual experiences and artistic preferences, creating distinctly unique bodies of work within the world of cinema."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Dissapointed Product review: I had to return the item because it was defective and the replacement came with missing parts. I was given a mere partial refund but I will think it twice before ordering again through Amazon. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review undoubtedly depicts the product in an unflattering light. A thorough analysis of the review reveals several negative aspects mentioned by the reviewer that contribute to this unfavorable representation of the product. Here are some key points that elucidate the unflattering portrayal: 1. Defective item: The reviewer initially received a defective product, which already establishes a negative perception of the item. Consumers anticipate receiving a fully functional and high-quality product when making a purchase. However, in this case, the delivered item did not meet the buyer's expectations, leading to dissatisfaction and disappointment. 2. Replacement issues: While the reviewer attempted to resolve the problem by requesting a replacement, they unfortunately faced another problem as the replacement item arrived with missing parts. This further aggravates the dissatisfaction and implies that this might not be a one-off issue, but rather a consistent flaw in the manufacturing or quality control process of the product. 3. Partial refund: The reviewer's dissatisfaction is exacerbated by the fact that they were only granted a partial refund upon returning the defective item. Ideally, a full refund should be provided in such cases to compensate for the inconvenience caused to the customer. A partial refund may lead the reviewer to feel that they were not adequately compensated for their troubles and that their customer rights were not fully respected by the seller. 4. Caution with future purchases: The effect of these negative experiences has proven significant enough for the reviewer to reconsider purchasing through Amazon in the future. This statement denotes a loss of trust in the platform and serves as a warning to other potential buyers who come across this review. As a result, the review clearly paints the product in an unflattering light, highlighting the negative experiences of the reviewer. These experiences, which entail receiving a defective product, encountering difficulties with the replacement item, and being inadequately compensated, generate a sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment. Consequently, any potential buyers reading this review may be deterred from purchasing the product, given the unfavorable impression it receives through this evaluation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Children in the camp will be given the opportunity to explore the unknown and put ideas into practice.      The program will challenge children to real world situations that will help them build a team spirit and life skills.      The program will include five modules this year.      One module will feature \\"Problem Solving on Planet ZAK\\". It will challenge children by creating a world of science fiction. Imitating a \\"crash\\" onto a planet, children will be asked to figure out ways to stay safe, find food and to \\"rebuild\\" their spacecraft, using a variety of common objects.      Another module will be \\"Saving Sludge City\\" which will have children find ways to create a cleaner and eco-friendly city.     \\"Imagination Point: Ride Physics\\" asks children to work as interns   in the world's newest and largest theme park called \\"Imagination Point\\". Children will learn the basic principles of motion through hands-on activities related directly to rides.      Another feature of the camp will be the \\"I Can Invent\\" which will focus on the real world of inventions by having children explore the process of invention.      The final module will be \\"Global Games\\" which will introduce games ranging from those played in ancient times to the present day to children.      \\"We want to encourage children to go into the fields of STEM,\\" Bryne said. \\"This program is a fun way to do that.\\" Question: Which feature of the camp can make children learn the basic principles of motion? - I Can Invent. - Imagination Point: Ride Physics - Global Games. - Saving Sludge City.

Question: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It \\"may well be\\" that theft of business data is \\"as serious a strategic threat to national security\\" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. \\"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,\\" Mr. Matchett said, adding : \\"It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught.\\" The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information.

This place was just too weird for my taste. When I go to a theater I go for the movie not for all the circus of it.   I liked the decor. The staff and manager were super nice and friendly. But they were way over staffed. I'm sure in a few months time they will realize the overhead costs vs the revenue.   I think the owner tried too hard. When you first walk in it feels like a hotel lobby/airport. They announce the movie times like when you board an airplane. They should have had staff dress like pilots and stewardess lol   The food is minimum 10 and about 12 for a salad. It felt like \\"restaurant\\" prices without the restaurant taste.

The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \\"You Really Got Me\\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. The Kinks started out playing the then popular R&B and blues styles; then, under the influence of The Kingsmen's \\"Louie Louie\\" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds -- due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as \\"the original punks\\". Dave Davies was \\"really bored with this guitar sound - or lack of an interesting sound\\" so he purchased \\"a little green amplifier ... an Elpico\\" from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and \\"twiddled around with it\\", including \\"taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC30\\" (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and \\"got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone [from the centre to the edge] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.\\" The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings--most notably on \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"All Day and All of the Night\\".  From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. \\"I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent.\\" The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, incorporating elements of music hall, folk, and baroque music through use of harpsichord, acoustic guitar, mellotron, and horns, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.  Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.

Chapter X. -- FRIEDRICH DOES HIS MORAVIAN EXPEDITION WHICH PROVES A MERE MORAVIAN FORAY.  While these Coronation splendors had been going on, Friedrich, in the Moravian regions, was making experiences of a rather painful kind; his Expedition prospering there far otherwise than he had expected. This winter Expedition to Mahren was one of the first Friedrich had ever undertaken on the Joint-stock Principle; and it proved of a kind rather to disgust him with that method in affairs of war.  A deeply disappointing Expedition. The country hereabouts was in bad posture of defence; nothing between us and Vienna itself, in a manner. Rushing briskly forward, living on the country where needful, on that Iglau Magazine, on one's own Sechelles resources; rushing on, with the Saxons, with the French, emulous on the right hand and the left, a Captain like Friedrich might have gone far; Vienna itself--who knows!--not yet quite beyond the reach of him. Here was a way to check Khevenhuller in his Bavarian Operations, and whirl him back, double-quick, for another object nearer home!--But, alas, neither the Saxons nor the French would rush on, in the least emulous. The Saxons dragged heavily arear; the French Detachment (a poor 5,000 under Polastron, all that a captious Broglio could be persuaded to grant) would not rush at all, but paused on the very frontier of Moravia, Broglio so ordering, and there hung supine, or indeed went home.  Friedrich remonstrated, argued, turned back to encourage; but it was in vain. The Saxon Bastard Princes \\"lived for days in any Schloss they found comfortable;\\" complaining always that there was no victual for their Troops; that the Prussians, always ahead, had eaten the country. No end to haggling; and, except on Friedrich's part, no hearty beginning to real business. \\"If you wish at all to be 'King of Moravia,' what is this!\\" thinks Friedrich justly.

This is the right answer because in this context, it makes the most sense for Shahar Peer, the Israeli tennis player, to express her confidence that the \\"Tour\\", or the tennis tour organizers, will make sure she isn't treated unfairly in future events.  Other answers are wrong because it wouldn't make sense for Shahar Peer to say them.

It's not right for her to say \\"Peer will take appropriate actions\\" because she is Peer and she can't fix things alone. \\"Player\\" isn't the correct choice either because it refers to all players, not just one. \\"Shahar Peer\\" is not correct because it repeats the name unnecessarily in the sentence.

Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This is supposed to amplify signals from 40 Mhz to 900 Mhz (below channel 2 to above the highest UHF channel). If that were true, it would be good for boosting an antenna signal enough to compensate for the loss you get when splitting the signal to several TVs. It works well for all VHF channels. It does not boost the low UHF channels very much, and it makes channels above 30 noisy. It attenuates the mid to high UHF channels (has negative gain).

How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of regret, sadness, and disappointment. It portrays an emotional experience of an individual who has unintentionally lost something valuable to them - in this case, a voicemail that they wanted to keep. This tweet serves multiple purposes: it communicates the user's feelings and shares their experience so that others can empathize with their situation. 1. Regret: The tweet starts with \\"I just realized I deleted a voicemail,\\" which highlights the realization of an unintentional action. The individual indicates that the voicemail was something they truly wanted to hold onto, suggesting that they deeply regret their mistake and wish they could reverse the action. 2. Sadness: The tweet includes a direct expression of sadness—\\"Sadness...\\"—that functions as a reflection of their emotional state. This explicit statement of sadness illustrates a sense of vulnerability as they share their emotions with their followers on social media. 3. Disappointment: In conjunction with the other emotions, the sentiment of disappointment can be inferred as well. The user feels let down by the loss of the voicemail, as it was something they \\"really really wanted to keep.\\" This disappointment may not only be directed at themselves for accidentally deleting the voicemail but also at the situation that led to the loss in the first place. To sum up, the sentiment of this tweet covers a range of negative emotions—regret, sadness, and disappointment—elicited by the unintentional loss of a cherished voicemail.

Serious skating accidents are most common in pairs.  - Single skating is a discipline of figure skating in which male and female skaters compete individually. Men's singles and ladies' singles are both Olympic disciplines and are both governed by the International Skating Union, along with the other Olympic figure skating events, pair skating and ice dancing.

It was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back. The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffman and Bernard Shir-Cliff.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company).  - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana:  or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan.  - Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann. It was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as \\"Tsubasa Chronicle\\" and \\"xxxHolic\\", are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that \\"Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts\\".  - Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915  May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey.  - The Silver Wolf is a novel by Alice Borchardt and published by Del Rey Books in 1993 . It is the first in the Silver Wolf Trilogy .  - Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels, \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in 1994, and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002.  - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion.  - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world.  As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC.  - Alice Borchardt (née Alice Allen O'Brien; October 6, 1939  July 24, 2007) was a writer of historical fiction, fantasy, horror.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.  Now, I have a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.  Answer this question please: Which planet is currently making less oceanic crust? Answer:","output":"Timon is currently making less oceanic crust, as it is a stable planet with no continental movement for quite some time. On the other hand, Planet Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving, which would cause more oceanic crust to be formed due to volcanic activity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What film does Dickie audition for? Movie title: Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star Movie plot: Dickie Roberts is a former child star who shot to fame on a TV sitcom called The Glimmer Gang with his catchphrase \\"This is Nuckin' Futs!\\". His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at Morton's and appearing on Celebrity Boxing, where he is matched with Emmanuel Lewis. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up. After talking to an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie. Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives. Unfortunately, Dickie never had a real childhood; he grew up in the limelight, and then his mother abandoned him when his show was cancelled. Desperate to prove to Reiner that he's right for the part, Dickie sells his raunchy autobiography to raise 30,000. With the money, he pays a family to \\"adopt\\" him for a month, as he believes he will \\"watch and learn\\". Once Dickie hires his \\"family\\", things get off to a rocky start, as George, the bread winning father, insists that they need the money, despite the rightful reservations of the other family members.

This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Options: (I) they make more financial contribution to the family. (II) they hold higher status in the home and community. (III) they are more reliable and willing to repay the loan. (IV) they are more likely to spend what they earn on their children. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty   by micro-credits. These very small loans  , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15... Question: Bank loans are mainly made to women because   _  .

I would give it a 3-star rating out of 5 for its overall performance and functionality. On a positive note, the app does fulfill its main purpose of providing users control over their device's superuser permissions. As a tech-savvy person, I appreciate having the ability to manage these permissions to ensure that only authorized apps get access to such crucial system controls. The interface is also user-friendly, and the app is relatively easy to set up and use. However, there are a few areas that could use improvement. Firstly, the app tends to be a bit unstable at times, crashing or freezing more often than I would like. While this issue is not persistent, it can be quite frustrating when it occurs. The updates for the app are few and far between, and I feel this could be a significant factor behind its stability issues. More frequent updates would address these concerns by incorporating bug fixes and the latest security patches. Finally, I believe the app could benefit from expanded compatibility with more devices and custom ROMs. While it works well on some of my gadgets, it has not been fully compatible with others, requiring me to search for alternative solutions in those cases.

Find out what they are after the jump.      The first honor goes to former Texas Medical student Wesley Pemberton who had the world’s longest leg hair, which had grown to 5 inches long. After Pemberton realized it wasn’t a girl’s hair that had landed on his leg, he started conditioning the stuff to make sure it stayed nice. Dealbreaker? [KLTV] An English man named Ken Edwards ate 36 cockroaches in one minute on the appropriately named British morning show “The Big Breakfast.” He said that swallowing the critters is “like having an anesthetic at the back of the throat,” because of the scent they emit to ward off predators. Apparently, Ken got attention several years ago after putting 47 rats down his pants. [Guinness World Records] The record for the longest fingernails belonged to a woman named Lee Redmond, who managed to avoid cutting her nails since 1979 and they’d grown to a combined 28 ft., 4.5 inches. But when they broke off in a car crash, the 68-year-old realized it was way easier to do things without them and decided it was a sign to “move on.” The record was passed on to Melvin Booth whose nails were 29 ft., 8.3 inches. [The Wondrous, Telegraph] Last year, a man named Chayne Hultgren, but who calls himself The Space Cowboy, pulled 907 pounds using his eye sockets in Milan. How someone figures out they’re really good at pulling heavy things with their eye sockets we may never know. Apparently, when you put Mentos into a bottle of Coca Cola, it erupts. This is important to know if you intend to break the world record for most simultaneous Mentos-fueled Diet Coke explosions ever! This August, Mexico City broke China’s world record with 2,433 participants. (China’s record in June had 2,175 enthusiasts.) [World Record News] In 2008, 1,253 people dressed like Smurfs and gathered at the Muckno Mania Festival in Ireland. Naturally, they won the record for largest gathering of people dressed as Smurfs. It’s kind of shocking what some people will do to get in the book, but it’s also kind of impressive how people can come together for a common purpose. It’s too bad most of the common purposes don’t actually help anyone, but I guess fun is important and someone has to take care of the blue paint industry.

Bernie Barker retired from his energy job and took up a career stripping ... when he was 60 years old.

[Guinness World Records] There was an epic battle over who got the most piercings in one sitting, between a guy named Robison in Marseilles and a British dude named Kam Ma. Apparently, Robison was out to beat Kam Ma’s 2002 record of 600 piercings, by getting 1,000 piercings. But Kam Ma caught wind of Robison’s plan and broke his own record with 1,015 piercings, then Robison increased his plan for 1,200 but ended up getting 1,016 piercings cause he hadn’t thought about how crappy getting stuck with needles will feel after a few hours. After setting the record, he took out all of them except for the record-breaking one. [Oddee] ||||| Most visitors to Antarctica go to see the penguins and the glaciers. Ashrita Furman went to hop on a pogo stick.      Mr. Furman, seeking to break the Guinness World Record for the fastest mile on a pogo stick, jumped up and down a landing strip on the Antarctic tundra in 2003.      Ashrita Furman      \\"The conditions were pretty hard,\\" says the 56-year-old New Yorker, noting that extreme temperatures caused his pogo stick to freeze up midway through the event. He nevertheless completed the feat in 17 minutes, 45 seconds, setting the world record.      It was just another day in the life of Mr. Furman, who holds the ultimate Guinness world record: The record for Guinness world records.      Since 1979—when he set his first record by completing 27,000 jumping jacks—Mr. Furman has set 312 Guinness records, more than anyone else. He currently holds 120 titles.      Watch clips from some of Guinness World Record-Record Holder Ashrita Furman's Events.      Thursday, Guinness is holding its annual Guinness World Records Day and has flown Mr. Furman to London to participate. The company expects more than 300,000 people world-wide to compete in activities ranging from the largest gathering of people dressed as characters from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to the heaviest road vehicle pulled by human teeth.      Mr. Furman's mission: break the record for walking with the heaviest shoes. He's hoping to add enough weight to a pair of custom-made metal boots so that each foot will weigh about 160 pounds.      \\"He's living and breathing what Guinness is all about,\\" says Alistair Richards, Managing Director of Guinness World Records. \\"He lives by a philosophy that nothing is impossible.\\"      Mr. Furman has been defying the impossible for more than 30 years.      In 1981, he clapped his hands for 50 hours straight—loud enough so that the sound could be heard 120 yards away—at a pond near his home in Queens, New York. \\"The hardest part was staying up,\\" he says.      In 1986, he somersaulted continuously more than 12 miles through Massachusetts, along the route followed by Paul Revere on his famous midnight ride. After eating four slices of pizza the night before, Mr. Furman became ill during the somersaults. \\"I was exhausted, nauseous, and my abdomen cramped with each roll,\\" he says. But he made it.      In 2005, he broke the record for spinning the largest hula hoop—14 feet 6 inches—at least three revolutions.      The following year, he, along with some friends, built the largest popcorn structure—20 feet 10 inches—in the shape of a multitiered cake.

Guinness says it receives about 1,000 applications a week for new record categories. About 80% are rejected. It currently has about 40,000 categories.      \\"We are very, very broad,\\" says Guinness's Mr. Richards. \\"As long as it's measurable, as long as you can quantify that measurement, as long as it can be broken, as long as we think it's interesting, it stands a chance.\\"      Enlarge Image Close Jowan Gauthier Mr. Furman's feats include covering the most distance on a pogo stick while juggling three balls in Easter Island.      Unlike many reigning champs, who secure endorsements, Mr. Furman doesn't profit from his victories, and he's happy to share the secrets of his success. He has turned down endorsements and instead manages a health food store in Queens, not far from where he grew up. He gets a little financial help from his father—a retired lawyer and executive.      Mr. Furman says he fell in love with the Guinness World Records Book when he was 10. \\"I remember carrying it around and reading it under the covers at night,\\" he says.      Since he wasn't athletic as a child, he figured he could never break a Guinness record. His father, Bernie Furman, says there was little sign that the younger Mr. Furman would become a world class competitor. He cut gym so often that his mother had to plead with an assistant principal to let him graduate on time from Jamaica High School and attend Columbia University.      After two years, he dropped out of college to study meditation with an Indian-born spiritual teacher, Sri Chinmoy. Around this time, Mr. Furman, whose birth name was Keith, changed his name to Ashrita, which means \\"protected by God\\" in Sanskrit. He says the meditation he learned from Mr. Chinmoy allows him to perform beyond his expectations.      In 1978, Mr. Chinmoy convinced Mr. Furman to train for a long distance road bike marathon. After surprising himself by coming in third, Mr. Furman set his sights on Guinness records.      Mr. Furman, who is single, gets most of his ideas from studying existing records and deciding if he can break them. He tries to pick records that work different areas of the body, he says, so he can have a \\"well rounded\\" training schedule.      Enlarge Image Close Prabhakar Street Mr. Furman's feats also include sack racing a yak in Mongolia.      \\"I would find myself in places, and I would see an opportunity,\\" he says. While on a trip to Mongolia in 2007, he decided to do a competition there. After seeing yaks, he attempted a one-mile sack race against a yak—clocking in at 16 minutes, 41 seconds, breaking the existing sack race record.      He notes that many of his records don't require much athletic ability. They include egg cracking with one hand, lemon peeling and duct taping oneself to a wall. But winning can take years. It also requires discipline, creativity and friends willing to toss, measure and build.      It's not unusual for Mr. Furman to brainstorm with friends when he's trying to win a record. Homagni Baptista, a friend from his meditation group, experimented for weeks with different recipes when Mr. Furman was trying to build the world's largest lollipop.      No ordinary sucker, the raspberry lollipop was made after the men spent a few days building a mold in the back of a flat bed truck and another four days boiling sugar. In the end, it weighed about 6,500 pounds.      Almost weekly, someone in the world is breaking one of his records. His response: Work to retake it and come up with more competitions.      \\"I want to inspire people,\\" says Mr. Furman, who is almost always training for three or four events. \\"If you have a dream, you can achieve your dream.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a question about this article: Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries. Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory. In 1933, there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany, of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned. Of those, 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed. In Canada, Jehovah's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent. In the former Soviet Union, about 9,300 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, including China, Vietnam and some Islamic states. What is the answer to this question: Why have Jehovah's Witnesses sometimes been imprisoned?","output":"Jehovah's Witnesses have sometimes been imprisoned because they believe in remaining politically neutral and refuse to serve in the military. This means that during times like World War II and when countries have required people to join their armies, the Jehovah's Witnesses would not do so.

Article: When you tidy your messy bedroom, it gets a lot easier to find things. Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain, helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas. To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris   for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't. Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night--in the course of your life, you'll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming. There's probably no single answer to the question why we dream, but there doesn't have to be.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Q:Given the below context:  By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to  visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when  he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after  further surgery  he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital  went well, but his conducting in the afternoon  was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\".  Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie  that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.

The equation has two terms with the variable n, namely -26n and 119n. We can combine them as follows: (-26n + 119n) + 1395 = 0 93n + 1395 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable. To isolate n, we want to get rid of the 1395 term on the left side and have n alone. We can do that by subtracting 1395 from both sides of the equation: 93n + 1395 - 1395 = 0 - 1395 93n = -1395 Step 3: Solve for n. Now, we can find the value of n by dividing both sides of the equation by 93: 93n / 93 = -1395 / 93 n = -15 So, the solution to the equation -26n + 119n + 1395 = 0 is n = -15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Reichswehr (English: Imperial Defence) formed the military organisation of Germany from 1919 until 1935, when it was united with the new \\"Wehrmacht\\" (Defence Force).  - The Jagdpanther (German: \\"hunting panther\\") was a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II based on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The \\"Jagdpanther\\" combined the very powerful 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew readiness.  - The Pak 43 ( Panzerabwehrkanone 43 ) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War . The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers , also serving in modified form as the 8.8 cm KwK 43 main gun on the Tiger II tank , to the open - top Nashorn , and fully enclosed , casemate - hulled Elefant and Jagdpanther tank destroyers . The improved 8.8 cm gun had a very flat trajectory out to 914 m ( 1,000 yd ) , making it easier for the gunner to hit targets at longer ranges as fewer corrections in elevation were needed . In addition to this , the gun 's exceptional penetration performance made it able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank to see service during the war at long ranges , even the Soviet IS - 2 tanks and IS chassis - based tank destroyers . The gun 's maximum firing range exceeded 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) .  - The 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 (Kampfwagenkanone \\"fighting vehicle cannon\\") was an 88 mm 71 calibre tank gun designed by Krupp and used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was mounted as the primary armament on the Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B \\"Tiger II\\" and the 8.8 cm PaK 43, an anti-tank gun, was very similar in design and use albeit not mounted on tanks but rather on tank destroyers or deployed on the field.   - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows.  - Nashorn (German \\"rhinoceros\\", pronounced [nashn]), initially known as Hornisse (German \\"hornet\\"), was a German tank destroyer of World War II. It was developed as an interim solution in 1942 by equipping a light turretless chassis with the Pak 43 heavy anti-tank gun. Though only lightly armoured and displaying a high profile, it could frontally penetrate any Allied tank at long range, and its relatively low cost and superior mobility to heavier vehicles ensured it remained in production until the war's end.  - Hornets (insects in the genera Vespa and Provespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives yellow jackets. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head and by the rounded segment of the abdomen just behind the waist. Worldwide, there are 22 recognized species of \\"Vespa\\", and three species of \\"Provespa\\", which are unique amongst hornets in being nocturnal. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (\\"Vespa crabro\\"), is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America and Northeast Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus \\"Dolichovespula\\" are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g. baldfaced hornets), but are actually yellowjackets.  - Essen (Latin: \\"Assindia\\") is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Its population of approximately 589,000 makes it the ninth-largest city in Germany. It is the central city of the northern (Ruhr) part of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area and seat to several of the region's authorities.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\". The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany.  - Friedrich Carl Krupp (Essen, 17 July 1787  Essen, 8 October 1826) was a German steel manufacturer and founder of the Krupp family commercial empire that is now subsumed into ThyssenKrupp AG.  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919.  - Rheinmetall AG is an automotive parts supplier and military technology group headquartered in Düsseldorf. In fiscal 2015 (2014), the company's 20,676 (20,166) employees generated sales of €5.18 billion (€4.68 billion). Rheinmetall was the tenth-largest European defence contractor in 2011.  - U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot , a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \\"undersea boat\\". While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding), enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada, the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Elefant (German for \\"elephant\\") was a heavy tank destroyer used by German Wehrmacht Panzerjäger during World War II. It was built in small numbers in 1943 under the name Ferdinand after its designer Ferdinand Porsche, using tank hulls that had been produced for the Tiger I tank requirement which was rejected in favour of a Henschel design.  - Ferdinand Porsche (3 September 1875  30 January 1951) was an automotive engineer and founder of the Porsche car company. He is best known for creating the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner-Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, several other important developments and Porsche automobiles. In addition, Porsche designed the 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen, which was the first racing car with a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.  - The Krupp family (see pronunciation), a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, have become famous for their production of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments. The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities.  - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.

Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr.  was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a ditch digger, and the former Byrl Veda Page. The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them.  On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\"  Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on Larry King Live commenting \\"Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ... The truth of this story stands up to this day.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did Dan Rather do a story on the Killian documents?","output":"Yes, Dan Rather did a story on the Killian documents.

After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917â1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board. After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely \\"awakens\\" from his catatonic state.

During these twenty-eight years wars and revolutions had come and gone in Europe. Her uncle, Stanley Baldwin, had led his country for some time. Technical developments had changed the conditions of everyday life almost beyond recognitions, but all these events had left as a matter of fact untouched the small religious community to which she had belonged. In 1949 Miss Baldwin published her impressions of those bewildering years of her return to a world in which the motorcar had replaced the horse and carriage and where respectable women showed their legs and painted their faces.        Yet it was not only these odd sights that surprised her, for she was more puzzled by what she heard. During a railway journey the term \\"luggage in advance\\" meant nothing to her, so in desperation she asked the porter to do as he thought best. Reading the newspapers made her feel very stupid, because the writers of reviews and leading articles used words and phrases such as Jazz,prefix = st1 /Hollywood, Cocktail and Isolationism. These and many others were quite incomprehensible to Miss Baldwin, who was really bewildered when friends said: \\"It's your funeral or Believe it or not.\\" This is a rare and valuable reminder to the rest of us that the English language does not stand still. All language changes over a period of time for reasons which are imperfectly understood. Or rather since speech is really a form of human activity, it is more exact to say that each successive generation behaves linguistically in a slightly different manner from its predecessors(,).

Here is an email: Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions. I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative. We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations (characterized as \\"a VERY smart guy on climate\\"): Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC. Has been on UK climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful). Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out; big figure in Europe). Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or Brenton). Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good presenter and a good economist. WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A USEFUL TOPIC. I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: \\"I remember promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly on the Continent, to the U.S. model. I got the following names from Jay Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as possibilities. Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of Henkel, very senior),  Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse Coopers - would be the most junior of the three. I don't personally know any of the three.\\" Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face. 1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if allowed to do so. 2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above). 3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy. 4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk). 5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way. 6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers. 7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me, we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and the inventor of the \\"climate change levy\\" that is driving industry in this country nuts. Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum, which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with Ken at his convenience.

Russell in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.      The sentences was announced Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; David J. Hale, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky; and Perrye K. Turner, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Louisville Division.      Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 25, a former resident of Iraq, was sentenced to life in federal prison, and Waad Ramadan Alwan, 31, a former resident of Iraq, was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison, followed by a life term of supervised release. Both defendants had pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges.            “These two former Iraqi insurgents participated in terrorist activities overseas and attempted to continue providing material support to terrorists while they lived here in the United States. With today’s sentences, both men are being held accountable,” said Assistant Attorney General Monaco. “I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.”      “These are experienced terrorists who willingly and enthusiastically participated in what they believed were insurgent support operations designed to harm American soldiers in Iraq,” stated U.S. Attorney Hale. “The serious crimes of both men merit lengthy punishment, and only the value of Alwan’s immediate and extensive cooperation with law enforcement justifies our recommendation of a reduced sentence for him. Bringing these men to justice is the result of a comprehensive law enforcement effort. The FBI agents of the Louisville Division, along with the federal and local law enforcement members of the Joint Terrorism Task Forces here in Kentucky, including the Bowling Green Police Department, and our many other partners, are to be commended.”      “Protecting the United States from terrorist attacks remains the FBI's top priority,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Turner. “Using our growing suite of investigative and intelligence capabilities, FBI agents and analysts assigned to our Bowling Green office were able to neutralize a potential threat. Our local Joint Terrorism Task Force, comprised of FBI Agents and other local, state and federal agencies from across the Commonwealth, remains committed to dismantling extremist networks and cutting off financing and other forms of support provided by terrorist sympathizers, whether they are operating in Kentucky or worldwide.”            “Today, the sentencing of Alwan and Hammadi represents the culmination of the extensive, effective and focused efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Kentucky Division of the FBI for their roles in the investigation and prosecution of these would-be terrorists. I want to thank U.S. Attorney David Hale, the Kentucky Division of the FBI and the members of the FBI Bowling Green local office for their individual and collective efforts in bringing Alwan and Hammadi to justice for their crimes against the people of Kentucky and the United States,” stated Chief Doug Hawkins, Bowling Green Police Department.      Alwan, whose fingerprints were found on an unexploded IED found in Iraq, pleaded guilty earlier in the case on Dec. 16, 2011, to all counts of a 23-count federal indictment. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad; conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) against U.S. nationals abroad; distributing information on the manufacture and use of IEDs; attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to AQI and conspiring to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles.      Hammadi pleaded guilty on Aug. 21, 2012, to a 12-count superseding indictment. Charges against him included attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to AQI; conspiring to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles; and making a false statement in an immigration application. At today’s sentencing, at the request of the United States, Alwan received a reduced sentence due to his cooperation with federal law enforcement. The United States asked for no reduction of Hammadi’s sentence.      According to information presented by the United States in connection with today’s sentencings, Hammadi and Alwan both admitted, in FBI interviews that followed waiver of their Miranda rights, to participation in the purported material support operations in Kentucky, and both provided the FBI details of their prior involvement in insurgent activities while living in Iraq. Both men believed their activities in Kentucky were supporting AQI. Alwan admitted participating in IED attacks against U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and Hammadi admitted to participating in 10 to 11 IED attacks as well as shooting at a U.S. soldier in an observation tower.            Court documents filed in this case reveal that the Bowling Green office of the FBI’s Louisville Division initiated an investigation of Alwan in which they used a confidential human source (CHS). The CHS met with Alwan and recorded their meetings and conversations beginning in August 2010. The CHS represented to Alwan that he was working with a group to ship money and weapons to Mujahadeen in Iraq. From September 2010 through May 2011, Alwan participated in ten separate operations to send weapons and money that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq. Between October 2010 and January 2011, Alwan drew diagrams of multiple types of IEDs and instructed the CHS how to make them. In January 2011, Alwan recruited Hammadi, a fellow Iraqi national living in Bowling Green, to assist in these material support operations. Beginning in January 2011 and continuing until his arrest in late May 2011, Hammadi participated with Alwan in helping load money and weapons that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq.      Documents filed by the United States describe in detail the material support activities of the men in Bowling Green. Without Hammadi present, Alwan loaded money and weapons he believed were being sent to Iraq on five occasions from September 2010 through February 2011, handling five rocket-propelled grenade launchers, five machine guns, two sniper rifles, two cases of C4 explosive and what he believed to be 375,000. After Hammadi joined Alwan in January 2011, the two men loaded money and weapons together on five occasions from January to May 2011. Together, on these five occasions, they loaded five rocket-propelled grenade launchers, five machine guns, five cases of C4 explosive, two sniper rifles, one box of 12 hand grenades, two Stinger surface-to-air missile launchers and what they believed to be a total of 565,000. Alwan and Hammadi were recorded by video during these operations.      In speaking with the CHS, Alwan spoke of his efforts to kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq, stating “lunch and dinner would be an American.” Hammadi told the CHS that he had experience in Iraq with “Strelas” (a Russian made, portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile launcher) and discussed shipping “Strelas” in future operations.      According to the charging documents, Hammadi entered the United States in July 2009, and, after first residing in Las Vegas, moved to Bowling Green. Hammadi and Alwan were arrested on May 25, 2011, in Bowling Green on criminal complaints. Both defendants were closely monitored by federal law enforcement authorities in the months leading up to their arrests. Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States. All of the weapons, including Stinger missiles, had been rendered inert before being handled by Hammadi and Alwan. The weapons and money handled by the men in the United States were never provided to AQI, but instead were carefully controlled by law enforcement as part of the undercover operation.      This case was investigated by the Louisville Division of the FBI. Assisting in the investigation were members of the Louisville and Lexington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Bowling Green Police Department.      The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Bennett and Bryan Calhoun from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Kentucky and Trial Attorney Larry Schneider from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. ||||| Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Donald Trump, has come in for criticism and ridicule after blaming two Iraqi refugees for a massacre that never happened.      Conway, the US president’s former campaign manager who has frequently faced the press to defend his controversial moves, cited the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” in an interview in which she backed the travel ban imposed on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.      Interviewed by Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s Hardball programme on Thursday evening, Conway compared the executive order issued by Trump in his first week in the White House to what she described as a six-month ban imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama.      This claim has been debunked by commentators who have pointed out that the 2011 action was a pause on the processing of refugees from Iraq after two Iraqi nationals were arrested over a failed attempt to send money and weapons to al-Qaida in Iraq.      Conway told Matthews: “I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalised and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.      “Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.”      Trump defends chaotic foreign policy: 'We're going to straighten it out, OK?' Read more      It didn’t get covered, many are now pointing out, because there was no such massacre.      The two Iraqi men arrested in 2011 did live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and are currently serving life sentences for federal terrorism offences. But there was no massacre, nor were they accused of planning one. The US department of justice, announcing their convictions in 2012, said: “Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States.”      Analysis by the Cato Institute of terrorist attacks on US soil between 1975 and 2015 found that foreign nationals from the seven countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban – Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia – have killed no Americans.      Following the Conway interview, some social media users pointed out that false rumours about a Halloween massacre had circulated in several universities, including Ohio’s Bowling Green state university, in 1998.      But the likelihood that Conway had Kentucky in mind was bolstered when that state’s senator Rand Paul also made a variation of her false claim. In a separate interview with MSNBC, Paul referred to “the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, where I live”.      Joe Sonka (@joesonka) Rand Paul: \\"...the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, where I live.\\"      (Prosecutor said there was no attempt or even plot to bomb in America) pic.twitter.com/O0BMEgk4XF      Conway had already prompted astonishment by describing comments by White House spokesman Sean Spicer that Trump’s inauguration crowd “was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period” as “alternative facts”.      “You’re saying it’s a falsehood, and they’re giving – Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,” Conway told NBC last week.      Matthews did not press Conway on her Bowling Green massacre claim in the interview, and she has not yet responded to reports that she misrepresented the events of 2011. ||||| Several dozen suspected terrorist bombmakers, including some believed to have targeted American troops, may have mistakenly been allowed to move to the United States as war refugees, according to FBI agents investigating the remnants of roadside bombs recovered from Iraq and Afghanistan.      The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky -- who later admitted in court that they'd attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq -- prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists' fingerprints.      \\"We are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,\\" FBI Agent Gregory Carl, director of the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), said in an ABC News interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC News' \\"World News with Diane Sawyer\\" and \\"Nightline\\".      \\"I wouldn't be surprised if there were many more than that,\\" said House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul. \\"And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States; and quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me.\\"      As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News – even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi who had aided American troops was assassinated before his refugee application could be processed, because of the immigration delays, two U.S. officials said. In 2011, fewer than 10,000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U.S., half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show.      Suspect in Kentucky Discovered to Have Insurgent Past      An intelligence tip initially led the FBI to Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32, in 2009. The Iraqi had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home -- a story that shattered when the FBI found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that U.S. soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of Bayji, Iraq on Sept. 1, 2005. The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road.      An ABC News investigation of the flawed U.S. refugee screening system, which was overhauled two years ago, showed that Alwan was mistakenly allowed into the U.S. and resettled in the leafy southern town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, a city of 60,000 which is home to Western Kentucky University and near the Army's Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. Alwan and another Iraqi refugee, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, were resettled in Bowling Green even though both had been detained during the war by Iraqi authorities, according to federal prosecutors.      Most of the more than 70,000 Iraqi war refugees in the U.S. are law-abiding immigrants eager to start a new life in America, state and federal officials say.      But the FBI discovered that Alwan had been arrested in Kirkuk, Iraq, in 2006 and confessed on video made of his interrogation then that he was an insurgent, according to the U.S. military and FBI, which obtained the tape a year into their Kentucky probe. In 2007, Alwan went through a border crossing to Syria and his fingerprints were entered into a biometric database maintained by U.S. military intelligence in Iraq, a Directorate of National Intelligence official said. Another U.S. official insisted that fingerprints of Iraqis were routinely collected and that Alwan's fingerprint file was not associated with the insurgency.      “ ” How do they get into our community?      In 2009 Alwan applied as a refugee and was allowed to move to Bowling Green, where he quit a job he briefly held and moved into public housing on Gordon Ave., across the street from a school bus stop, and collected public assistance payouts, federal officials told ABC News.      \\"How do you have somebody that we now know was a known actor in terrorism overseas, how does that person get into the United States? How do they get into our community?\\" wondered Bowling Green Police Chief Doug Hawkins, whose department assisted the FBI.      Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Peter Boogaard said in a statement that the U.S. government \\"continually improves and expands its procedures for vetting immigrants, refugees and visa applicants, and today [the] vetting process considers a far broader range of information than it did in past years.\\"      \\"Our procedures continue to check applicants' names and fingerprints against records of individuals known to be security threats, including the terrorist watchlist, or of law enforcement concern... These checks are vital to advancing the U.S. government's twin goal of protecting the world's most vulnerable persons while ensuring U.S. national security and public safety,\\" the statement said.      Last year, a Department of Homeland Security senior intelligence official testified in a House hearing that Alwan and Hammadi's names and fingerprints were checked by the FBI, DHS and the Defense Department during the vetting process in 2009 and \\"came in clean.\\"      After the FBI received the intelligence tip later that year, a sting operation in Kentucky was mounted to bait Alwan with a scheme hatched by an undercover operative recruited by the FBI, who offered Alwan the opportunity to ship heavy arms to al Qaeda in Iraq. The FBI wanted to know if Alwan was part of a local terror cell -- a fear that grew when he tapped a relative also living in Bowling Green, Hammadi, to help out.      The FBI secretly taped Alwan bragging to the informant that he'd built a dozen or more bombs in Iraq and used a sniper rifle to kill American soldiers in the Bayji area north of Baghdad.      \\"He said that he had them 'for lunch and dinner,'\\" recalled FBI Louisville Supervisory Special Agent Tim Beam, \\"meaning that he had killed them.\\"      Alwan even sketched out IED designs, which the FBI provided to ABC News, that U.S. bomb experts had quickly determined clearly demonstrated his expertise.      'Needle in a Haystack' Fingerprint Match Found on Iraq Bomb Parts, White House Briefed      The case drew attention at the highest levels of government, FBI officials told ABC News, when TEDAC forensic investigators tasked with finding IEDs from Bayji dating back to 2005 pulled 170 case boxes and, incredibly, found several of Alwan's fingerprints on a Senao-brand remote cordless base station. A U.S. military Significant Action report on Sept. 1, 2005 said the remote-controlled trigger had been attached to \\"three homemade-explosive artillery rounds concealed by gravel with protruding wires.\\"      \\"There were two fingerprints, developed on the top of the base station,\\" Katie Suchma, an FBI supervisory physical scientist at TEDAC who helped locate the evidence, told ABC News at the center's IED examination lab. \\"The whole team was ecstatic because it was like finding a needle in a haystack.\\"      \\"This was the type of bomb he's talking about when he drew those pictures,\\" added FBI electronics expert Stephen Mallow.      Word was sent back to the FBI in Louisville.      \\"It was a surreal moment, it was a real game changer, so to speak, for the case,\\" FBI agent Beam told ABC News. \\"Now you have solidified proof that he was involved in actual attacks against U.S. soldiers.\\"      Worse, prosecutors later revealed at Hammadi's sentencing hearing that he and Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home – and to possibly attack other homeland targets.      \\"Many things should take place and it should be huge,\\" Hammadi told Alwan in an FBI-recorded conversation, which a prosecutor read at Hammadi's sentencing last year.      Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller briefed President Obama in early 2011 as agents and Louisville federal prosecutors weighed whether to arrest Alwan and Hammadi or continue arranging phony arms shipments to Iraq that the pair could assist with, consisting of machine guns, explosives and even Stinger missiles the FBI had secretly rendered inoperable and which never left the U.S.      But agents soon determined there were no other co-conspirators. An FBI SWAT team collared the terrorists in a truck south of Bowling Green in late May 2011, only weeks after al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan and Obama had visited nearby Fort Campbell to thank the SEALs and Army Nightstalker pilots for their successful mission. The Kentucky al Qaeda case drew little attention as the nation celebrated Bin Laden's death.      Suspects Linked to Attack That Killed 4 US Soldiers      Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers who had served in Bayji in 2005 saw news reports about the two arrests, and Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Hedetniemi called the FBI to alert them to an Aug. 9, 2005, IED attack that killed four of their troopers in a humvee patrolling south of the town. The U.S. attorney's office in Louisville eventually placed the surviving soldiers in its victim notification system for the case, even though it couldn't be conclusively proven that Alwan and Hammadi had killed the Guardsmen.      The four Pennsylvania soldiers killed that day were Pfc. Nathaniel DeTample, 19, Spec. Gennaro Pellegrini, 31, Spec. Francis J. Straub Jr., 24, and Spec. John Kulick, 35.      \\"It was a somber moment for the platoon, we had a great deal of love and respect for those guys and it hit us pretty hard,\\" Hedetniemi said in an interview in the Guard's armory near Philadelphia. \\"I think that these two individuals are innately evil to be able to act as a terrorist and attack and kill American soldiers, then have the balls to come over to the United States and try to do the same exact thing here in our homeland.\\"      Confronted with all the evidence against them, Alwan and Hammadi agreed to plead guilty to supporting terrorism and admitted their al Qaeda-Iraq past. Alwan cooperated and received 40 years, while Hammadi received a life term which he is appealing. A hearing for Hammadi's appeal took place Tuesday in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio.      \\"We need to take this as a case study and draw the right lessons from it, and not just high-five over this,\\" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero, who headed the military's Joint IED Defeat Organization until last May. \\"How did a person who we detained in Iraq -- linked to an IED attack, we had his fingerprints in our government system -- how did he walk into America in 2009?\\"      Barbero is credited with leveraging the Kentucky case to help the FBI get funding to create a new state of the art fingerprint lab focused solely on its IED repository in a huge warehouse outside Washington. The new FBI lab assists counterterrorism investigations of suspected bombmakers and IED emplacers and looks for latent prints on 100,000 IED remnants collected over the past decade by the military and stored in the vast TEDAC warehouse.

She told MSNBC's Chris Matthews:      \\"I bet it's brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn't get covered.\\"      First of all, Obama didn't ban the Iraqi refugee program.      Second, there's no such thing as the Bowling Green massacre.      Conway later clarified that she was referencing the case of two Iraqis -- Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi -- who lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Both were granted refugee status and entered the United States in 2009.      \\"On @hardball@NBCNews@MSNBC I meant to say 'Bowling Green terrorists' as reported here,\\" she said, before linking to an ABC news story on the case.      Mohanad Shareef Hammadi      Waad Ramadan Alwan      The two men were never planning on committing an act of terrorism on US soil. Instead, they were trying to help get weapons to al Qaeda in Iraq. They were terrorists who should not have been allowed in the country, but they weren't planning an attack in the United States. And they didn't kill anyone in Bowling Green (or anywhere else in the US).      CNN has reached out to the White House seeking comment of Conway's statement and have not yet received a response.      Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Trump's general election Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, referenced Conway's comments in a tweet Friday morning , saying \\"don't make up fake attacks.\\"      \\"Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks.\\"      Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017      Some background on that case:      After arriving in the United States, the men were monitored by federal authorities. They told an FBI confidential informant that they wanted to provide weapons and explosives to al Qaeda in Iraq, court documents said.      An extensive undercover sting operation was launched, authorities said, and Alwan -- who a Justice Department official once called \\"a really bad guy\\" -- told an undercover agent he had been involved with \\"hundreds\\" of IEDs.      An indictment released at the time said the United States was able to locate Alwan's fingerprints on an IED and on the base of a cordless phone used in an attack near Bayji, Iraq in the early 2000s. That the vetting process didn't work and that these men were allowed into the country highlighted serious flaws in the refugee resettlement system and led to reforms of the vetting process.      As a result, Obama ordered that 57,000-58,000 Iraqi refugees recently allowed into the country be revetted, causing a massive backlog. So, while there was no specific 'ban' on Iraqi refugees coming into the country, there was a delay in allowing anymore in. ||||| CLOSE Many will have you believe that President Obama's 2011 immigration order is the same as President Trump's travel ban. Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60      A woman yells as she protests President Trump's executive immigration ban at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 29, 2017 in Chicago. (Photo: Joshua Lott, AFP/Getty Images)      In defending his executive order banning immigration and travel from certain countries, which has touched off widespread anger and confusion, President Trump compared the order to action taken by the Obama administration in 2011.      CLOSE In response to the protests across the country against President Donald Trump's travel ban, former President Obama issued his first public statement since leaving office. Veuer's Nick Cardona has that story. Buzz60      “My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,” Trump claimed.      Obama administration officials and fact checkers say the claim is wrong.      Trump’s order banned visitors from seven Middle Eastern countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Syria — from coming to the United States for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to the United States.      In 2011, the State Department significantly slowed the number of visas it issued to Iraqis in order to review its vetting process. The concern stemmed from the arrests of two Iraqi refugees on terrorism charges in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 2011. One of the men was linked through fingerprints to an improvised explosive attack in Bayji, Iraq.      The arrests triggered concerns in the administration and on Capitol Hill and led to a massive review of Iraqi refugees already admitted to the country and more extensive vetting of those applying to immigrate to the United States. The action only applied to refugees from Iraq.      MORE:      Obama's office released a statement Monday that, while not directly critical of President Trump, did applaud those protesting a travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim countries.      \\"President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy — not just during an election but every day,\\" Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement.      \\"With regard to comparisons to President Obama’s foreign policy decisions, as we’ve heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\\" Lewis added.      Jon Finer, an Obama administration official, said the review slowed the pace of Iraqis coming into the United States, but never completely halted it.      The “flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration’s review,” Finer wrote in an article for Foreign Policy magazine’s website, but “there was no outright ban.”      But in 2012, the flow of refugees from Iraqi had returned to close to pre-2011 numbers.      Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post’s fact checker, gave the Trump claim “three Pinocchios,” indicating a “significant factual error.”      He cited several differences between the Obama administration action and Trump’s recent executive order:      Obama’s action was in response to a specific threat, it was not a complete halt of refugees from Iraq and it did not apply to all visitors from Iraq entering the United States, he said.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"The supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate further, let's go through each mentioned step of the process and understand how keeping the bread in a breadbin affects it. 1. Bread is exposed to the elements: When stored in a breadbin, the bread is sheltered from direct exposure to external elements, such as air and dust, which reduces the likelihood of mold spores landing on the bread. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air: The breadbin works as a barrier to prevent excessive moisture from entering and accumulating within the bread. In a breadbin, the humidity level can be regulated to some extent, depending on the design and material of the breadbin. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Breadbins are usually made from materials that provide insulation. This helps to maintain a stable temperature inside the breadbin, preventing the bread from absorbing excessive warmth from its surrounding environment. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: The breadbin acts as a physical barrier to minimize the presence of dust particles and mold spores directly landing on the bread. This indirectly affects the mold growth on the bread by reducing its exposure to mold spores. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Although keeping the bread in a breadbin may reduce the number of mold spores landing on the bread, if the bread is already contaminated, the mold spores will start consuming the bread for energy. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: The growth of mold colonies is affected by the humidity, temperature, and availability of mold spores. The breadbin indirectly impacts these factors to a certain extent, potentially slowing down the growth of mold colonies, but not completely stopping it. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of keeping bread in a breadbin indirectly impacts the steps in the process that lead to mold growth on the bread. It creates a more controlled environment for the bread, reducing exposure to elements like air, dust, and moisture, which in turn can slow down the mold growth process. However, this does not mean that the bread will remain mold-free indefinitely, as the breadbin cannot completely eliminate all factors that contribute to mold growth."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This causes her to go into an explosive rant and then the curtain closes on her and the main part of the cartoon starts. Porky is shown buying some flowers, candy, and then eventually a diamond ring. He proceeds to go over to Petunia's house and knock on the door, then Petunia goes to answer the door with her spoiled dog, Fluffnums. When she sees Porky, she is disgusted to see him so she disdainfully tells him to go away. This causes him to leave crying out of sadness and he then walks away, but Fluffnums sees the candy Porky has and alerts her to this fact. Petunia proceeds to run out after Porky and take him into her house, where she rips open the candy container and starts eating the candy.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Corley found that they avoid one costly habit: procrastination  . \\"It prevents even the most talented individuals from realizing success in life,\\" he writes in his upcoming book, \\"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\\" This goes hand-in-hand with author Napoleon Hill's claim that the wealthiest people are also the most decisive people. Out of the 500 millionaires Hill studied in the early 20thcentury, \\"Every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions quickly,\\" Hill wrote in his 1937 classic, \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" One of the major causes of procrastination is lack of passion, Corley emphasizes: \\"We simply like to do the things we like to do and we put off the things we do not like to do.\\" \\"According to Gallup, only 13% of employees are 'engaged' in their jobs, or emotionally invested in their work,\\" Corley writes. \\"Whether you realize it or not, procrastination is a big reason why you are struggling financially in life.

She is often associated with prosperity, well-being, and protection. During feudal Japan, the emperor was considered to be a direct descendant of Amaterasu, which gave him divine authority and legitimacy to rule. The imperial family claimed to be descended from the goddess, and this lineage was used to justify their political power and authority over the country. The emperor was seen as a divine figure and the embodiment of Amaterasu on earth. Throughout history, the cult of Amaterasu played a crucial role in upholding the emperor's power and influence. Shrines dedicated to the goddess were established across the country, and rituals and ceremonies were performed to honor her and ensure her favor upon the imperial family. This connection to the divine allowed the emperor to maintain control over his subjects and maintain his position as the ultimate authority in Japan. Even though the role of the emperor has evolved over time and Japan is now a constitutional monarchy, the reverence for Amaterasu and the imperial family is still deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and society. The emperor continues to hold a symbolic and ceremonial role, with his divine descent from Amaterasu being an important aspect of his legitimacy."},{"instruction":"Imagine brainstorming creatively with an anniversary theme and inspiring you to write a list of several textual and descriptive examples similar to a \\"prompt generator\\" and suitable to be applied to an AI image generator and in what contexts they have the message to create the image of an iconic, modern 28' with native Mexican patterns and motifs, wrapped within a simple silhouette of a circular medieval tower, celebrating the neighborhood's anniversary with a tapestry of tradition, using an 'Old School Graffiti' font for number 28.","output":"As a prompt generator for an AI image generator, envisioning a design that combines an iconic modern '28', native Mexican patterns, with the silhouette of a circular medieval tower in celebration of a neighborhood's anniversary, here are several textual and descriptive prompts suitable for creating such an image: 1. \\"A vibrant panorama of Aztec-inspired geometrical shapes forming the number 28 within the confines of a bold circular medieval tower outline, with a colorful tapestry background celebrating local heritage, the '28' written in dynamic 'Old School Graffiti' style.\\" 2. \\"A fusion of modernity and tradition: the silhouette of a medieval tower encircles a stylized '28', adorned with intricate Mexican Talavera tile motifs, and the entire composition is given a street art twist with a graffiti font number illuminated by the warmth of an anniversary sunset.\\" 3. \\"The number 28 comes alive with a blend of Huichol beadwork patterns set against the backdrop of a simple yet imposing medieval tower silhouette, each bead reflecting the neighborhood's years of unity, rendered in vivid 'Old School Graffiti' script.\\" 4. \\"An anniversary emblem showcasing a sleek '28', seamlessly integrated with the rich textures of Mayan glyphs, encased within the strong lines of a minimalist medieval tower structure, the entire image speaking of legacy and celebration through a graffiti-inspired typeface.\\" 5. \\"A harmonious mix of past and present: a contemporary '28' wrapped in the delicate embroidery of Oaxacan costumes, sitting within a silhouette of a timeless circular tower, the essence of the neighborhood's history etched in 'Old School Graffiti' font.\\" 6. \\"A bold synthesis of eras: an edgy yet sophisticated '28', patterned with the vibrant, symmetrical designs of native Mexican serapes, and encased within the outline of a grand medieval tower - a symbol of the enduring spirit, all highlighted with anniversary festivity in graffiti lettering.\\" 7. \\"Reflecting the neighborhood's founding with a poetic clash of elements—a sleek '28' set in a patchwork of Puebla pottery designs within an age-old circular tower contour, the annals of time narrated with an 'Old School Graffiti' flair.\\" 8. \\"Celebrate the neighborhood's anniversary with a strikingly modern '28', dressed in the folklore of Mexican papel picado, the crisp yet curving lines of a medieval tower encompassing the scene, with street-style graffiti typography dancing across the imagery.\\" 9. \\"Iconic and timeless, the image marries a circular medieval tower's stoic lines with a '28' that pulses with the life of Zapotec patterns, adding a layer of urban edge with a graffiti-esque dedication to the number, encapsulating joyous remembrance.\\" 10. \\"A majestic circular tower silhouette embraces a bold, Aztec calendar-inspired '28', the deep cultural roots of the neighborhood expressed through every intricately placed line, crowned with a celebratory 'Old School Graffiti' inscription.\\" Each of these prompts can be used in the context of creating artwork for posters, banners, community murals, digital screens, social media posts, or other mediums celebrating the neighborhood's anniversary, conveying a message of respect for tradition and the continuity of history through modern interpretation."},{"instruction":"a","output":"Hello!

The MoonGoons bravely band together, each using their unique abilities to outmaneuver the Void King’s minions. **Scene 8 – Final Showdown and Boofus' Choice** As the chaotic battle ensues, Boofus, empowered by his strength and mischievous wit, snags the stone. He's faced with a choice: keep the power for endless pranks or sacrifice it for the greater good. With Diggle's encouragement, Boofus, laughter in his eyes, relinquishes the stone, restoring balance. **Epilogue – Heroes of Harmony** With the universe saved, a grand celebration is held on the Moon. The MoonGoons laugh and dance among their alien peers, becoming legends. The community of intergalactic friends resolves to protect their corner of the cosmos with joy and teamwork. **Closing Scene:** A peaceful Moon shines against the backdrop of a stable universe. The laughter of the MoonGoons echoes into space, signaling not an end, but the beginning of many adventures to come. Boofus and Diggle exchange one last playful glance before they leap together into the stars, ready for whatever comes next. **The End.** **Credits roll over a catchy pop tune celebrating friendship and adventure, accompanied by animated outtakes and bloopers from the MoonGoons' quest.**"},{"instruction":"Write a blog post saying it is cute, and a user says they forgive Sony, and they are about to forgive them EVEN MORE because Spiderverse opens NEXT WEEK","output":"**Title: Sony's Epic Comeback: From Emojis to MoonGoons and the Awaited Spiderverse** Just when we thought Sony Pictures Animation might have taken a permanent nosedive with the less-than-stellar response to 'The Emoji Movie,' they've done the unthinkable—they've totally redeemed themselves with one of the most adorable and entertaining features to date: 'MoonGoons: The Celestial Quest.'

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell from a penalty of -50% to a +5o% bonus. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my list of spells is revised to less complex and more juvenile spells. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My starting set of spells. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"**Setting the Stage** The air crackles with anticipation as the amphitheater's seats fill with eager spectators, eyes wide and whispers flowing like an enchanted stream. At the center of the ancient stage that has seen countless magical duels, you, Sapphire, the prodigious 16-year-old and reigning teen champion of magic dueling, stand poised and confident. Your azure robes ripple with embroidered spells of prior victories, gently swaying with the excitement of the crowd. Beside you, stands little Lily, a curly-haired girl typically remembered for her doll-like appearance more than her spellcasting, but today she bears an unusual glimmer in her eye. Astoundingly, she is your challenger. The crowd stirs, wondering what this spectacle might bring. **Initial Player Stats** - **Sapphire's Stats**: - Spell Power (SP): 90 - Performance (PF): 85 - **Lily's Stats**: - Spell Power (SP): 65 - Performance (PF): 60 *Note: all values range from 1 to 100* **Complex Exponential Formula** (The Regression-Ingression Enchantment) Each round, after Sapphire casts her spell, her Age Regression (AR) and Lily's Age Progression (AP) are triggered. Here is the combined formula determining Sapphire's and Lily's stat alteration each turn: [SP_{new} = SP_{current} - (5 + 0.5 times Age_{difference}^ {1+0.2 times rounds})] [PF_{new} = PF_{current} - (5 + 0.4 times Age_{difference}^{1+0.15 times rounds})] [Childishness_{increase} = 15 times e^{0.5 times (Round - 1)}] Where ( Age_{difference} ) is the absolute difference in age after each spell Sapphire casts. As the duel progresses, Sapphire's age decreases while Lily's increases, impacting Age_difference and thus SP and PF degradation. The base decrease starts at 5 and exponentially grows with Round and Age_difference influence. **Childish Meter** Initially set to zero, the Childish Meter (CM) increases as Sapphire regresses in age. Once CM reaches 100, Sapphire's spell list transitions to a juvenile set. The CM tracks the accumulating childish effects on Sapphire's psyche and spellcrafting ability. **Sapphire's Starting Spells** (and required stats) 1. Stellar Flare (SP: 80, PF: 70) 2. Celestial Cascade (SP: 85, PF: 75) 3. Dragons' Dance (SP: 90, PF: 80) 4. Phoenix's Rebirth (SP: 92, PF: 85) 5. Faerie Ring Rhapsody (SP: 78, PF: 68) 6. Mirror of the Ancients (SP: 88, PF: 78) 7. Chrono-chorus (SP: 94, PF: 88) 8. Rainbow's End (SP: 76, PF: 65) 9. Whispering Winds (SP: 70, PF: 60) 10. Mermaids' Serenade (SP: 82, PF: 72) **Points System** Each spell has a base point value ranging from 50 to 100, depending on complexity and demand on stats. Successful casting awards base points, modified by Performance (+/- 50%). Failure to cast results in zero points for that turn, and poor execution (based on PF) may subtract up to 50% of the base points. **Scenario Commencement** Round 1 begins, and unknown to you, Lily quietly unleashes her secret spell, the Regression-Ingression Enchantment. You feel a momentary dizziness as the spell takes effect, but it quickly passes, and the duel begins. The crowd holds its breath, awaiting the contest of spellbound artistry. **Lily's Starting Spells** (and required stats) 1. Glittering Frost (SP: 65, PF: 55) 2. Butterfly Whirl (SP: 68, PF: 58) 3. Enchanted Meadow (SP: 70, PF: 60) 4. Dazzling Aurora (SP: 72, PF: 62) 5. Shimmering Mirage (SP: 74, PF: 64) 6. Luminous Bloom (SP: 76, PF: 66) 7. Bubbling Laughter (SP: 63, PF: 53) 8. Sunbeam Symphony (SP: 78, PF: 68) 9. Moonbeam Waltz (SP: 80, PF: 70) 10. Twinkling Twilight (SP: 82, PF: 72) With the spells at your command and the decree of the challenge before you, the duel unfolds in earnest. Remember, once you choose your spell, I will calculate the effects of your decision and the outcome of the round. Although the path ahead is fraught with mystical peril, your resolve is firm—for you are Sapphire, and the art of arcane battle flows through you like a river of stars. Let the duel begin."},{"instruction":"Mermaids’ Serenade","output":"The duel commences with you, Sapphire, making the opening move. With a flick of your wrist and an incantation as smooth as silk, you invoke the spell \\"Mermaid's Serenade.\\" **Sapphire's Attempt:** - Spell: Mermaid's Serenade - Required Spell Power (SP): 82 - Required Performance (PF): 72 - Base Points: 70 Given your starting stats (SP: 90, PF: 85), you are well above the threshold needed to cast this spell. As you channel your energy, ethereal figures of mermaids composed of shimmering water emerge, their haunting melodies enchanting all who hear. The judges award you the base points for the spell's successful execution. However, as the spell completes, Lily's hidden enchantment activates. Your age regresses, and Childishness begins to flood your senses. To calculate these effects after Round 1, considering you were 16 and she was 6 at the start: [ SP_{new} = 90 - (5 + 0.5 times 10^{1+0.2 times 1}) ] [ SP_{new} = 90 - (5 + 5) = 80 ] (10-year initial age difference modified by Round) [ PF_{new} = 85 - (5 + 0.4 times 10^{1+0.15 times 1}) ] [ PF_{new} = 85 - (5 + 4) = 76 ] The enchanted Regression-Ingression Enchantment causes your age to regress to 14, while Lily now appears to have aged to 8. Her ability to cast more complex spells grows, proportionate to yours diminishing. Now, let's see what spell little Lily chooses to counter your mesmerizing mermaids. **Lily's Attempt:** Lily opts for the spell \\"Enchanted Meadow,\\" an alluring display of blooming flowers and waving grass. - Spell: Enchanted Meadow - Required Spell Power (SP): 70 - Required Performance (PF): 60 - Base Points: 60 Lily starts with SP: 65, PF: 60. However, with the aging effect, she gains some of your skill: [ SP_{new} = 65 + (5 + 0.5 times 10^{1+0.2 times 1}) ] [ SP_{new} = 65 + (5 + 5) = 75 ] [ PF_{new} = 60 + (5 + 0.4 times 10^{1+0.15 times 1}) ] [ PF_{new} = 60 + (5 + 4) = 69 ] Lily successfully casts \\"Enchanted Meadow.\\" The visualization is striking, and the audience delights in the sudden burst of nature's beauty on stage, earning her the full base points as well. **Round 1 Scores:** - Sapphire (after Performance adjustment): 70 * 1.3 (because PF was 85, so +30%) = 91 points. - Lily (after Performance adjustment): 60 * 1.15 (because PF was 69, so +15%) = 69 points. **Childish Meter Levels:** [ Childishness_{increase} = 15 times e^{0.5 times (1 - 1)} ] [ Childishness_{increase} = 15 ] Your Childish Meter is now at 15 out of 100. **End of Round 1 Standings:** - Sapphire: 91 points, Age 14, SP: 80, PF: 76, CM: 15 - Lily: 69 points, Age 8, SP: 75, PF: 69 The duel is on, the enchantments fly, and the battle of beauty and glamour continues. Your next choice will be crucial as Lily has proven to be quite the unexpected contender, and your own magic begins to dance with youthful whimsy. What will your next spell be?"},{"instruction":"Stellar Flare","output":"**Sapphire's Attempt:** - Spell: Stellar Flare - Required Spell Power (SP): 80 - Required Performance (PF): 70 - Base Points: 90 At the start of Round 2, you confidently attempt to cast \\"Stellar Flare,\\" a spell known for its breathtaking display of cosmic energy and astral light. Your current stats (SP: 80, PF: 76) barely meet the threshold for Spell Power but comfortably exceed the Performance requirement. You focus deeply, calling down the celestial fires from the heavens above. This spell takes everything you have to offer. The arena is illuminated with a magnificent solar spectacle, a swirling vortex of stardust and shimmering solar flares that evokes the dawn of creation itself. The audience is spellbound by the dazzling performance. However, let's not forget the effect of Lily's hidden enchantment. The stellar flare completes, and you are once again regressed another two years. **Sapphire's Stat Calculations after Round 2:** With the audience unaware of Lily's enchantment: [ SP_{new} = 80 - (5 + 0.5 times 12^{1+0.2 times 2}) ] [ SP_{new} = 80 - (5 + 0.5 times 12^{1.4}) ] [ SP_{new} = 80 - (5 + 0.5 times 17.45) = 72.27 ] (Rounded down to 72) Your Spell Power is reduced significantly, but more critical to your situation is the increase in Lily’s capabilities. [ PF_{new} = 76 - (5 + 0.4 times 12^{1+0.15 times 2}) ] [ PF_{new} = 76 - (5 + 0.4 times 13.77) = 70.49 ] (Rounded down to 70) Although your performance remains solid, the purity of your magic is waning as Lily gains proficiency. Now at the tender age of 12, childlike innocence creeps into your thoughts, affecting your ability to cast more advanced spells. The Childishness feature is becoming an ever-growing obstacle. [ Childishness_{increase} = 15 times e^{0.5 times (2 - 1)} ] [ Childishness_{increase} = 15 times e^{0.5} = 22.2 ] (Rounded up to 23) Your Childish Meter now rises to 38 out of 100. Let's see if Lily seizes this opportunity to close the gap in points further. **Lily's Attempt:** Lily decides to escalate the battle with a higher-tier spell, choosing \\"Moonbeam Waltz.\\" - Spell: Moonbeam Waltz - Required Spell Power (SP): 80 - Required Performance (PF): 70 - Base Points: 80 With the age progression benefits: [ SP_{new} = 75 + (5 + 0.5 times 12^{1+0.2 times 2}) ] [ SP_{new} = 75 + (5 + 0.5 times 17.45) = 87.72 ] (Rounded up to 88) Lily's Spell Power has surpassed yours, reflecting the reversal of your initial advantage. [ PF_{new} = 69 + (5 + 0.4 times 12^{1+0.15 times 2}) ] [ PF_{new} = 69 + (5 + 0.4 times 13.77) = 74.51 ] (Rounded down to 74) With this increase, she performs the Moonbeam Waltz flawlessly, the stage becomes a tranquil nightscape as soft lunar beams dance gracefully across an ethereal sky. **Round 2 Scores:** - Sapphire (after Performance adjustment): 90 * 1.4 (because PF was 76, so +40%) = 126 points. - Lily (after Performance adjustment): 80 * 1.2 (because PF was 74, so +20%) = 96 points. **End of Round 2 Standings:** - Sapphire: 91 + 126 = 217 points, Age 12, SP: 72, PF: 70, CM: 38 - Lily: 69 + 96 = 165 points, Age 10, SP: 88, PF: 74 Despite the increasing challenge, you maintain your lead with enchanting expertise. Yet as the duel advances, you must tread carefully. Your authority in this contest wanes with every passing moment. Think wisely on your next spell, for the whimsy of youth beckons ever closer.

A digital anomaly, known only as \\"The Glitch\\", is sweeping through the layers of the internet, corrupting memes and causing them to fade into obscurity. As entire formats and classic memes vanish, panic spreads throughout the Meme-verse. Main Plot: Among the chaos, a courageous group of memes steps forward to save their world. This fellowship includes: - Doge, the lovable Shiba Inu with a knack for broken English and a heart of gold. - Grumpy Cat, the feline with a frown ready to defy any pessimism. - Pepe the Frog, seeking redemption from his controversial past. - And Nyan Cat, the eternally optimistic pop-tart cat zooming through the web. Our heroes embark on a quest to find the Source Code, the core of the Meme-verse where they can reset the system and eliminate The Glitch. On their journey, they travel through various forums and social media platforms, each a mini-world with its own rules and native memes, facing challenges, meeting allies, and battling corrupted memes who try to stop them. Sub-plot: While this epic quest unfolds, we cut to the real-world subplot of Mr. Bingley, an endearing English teacher in his 50s who's struggling to connect with his high school students. In an attempt to be relatable, Mr. Bingley starts incorporating memes into his lessons about Shakespeare, metaphors, and grammar.

During the epic showdown, our heroes look beaten, their powers diminishing against The Dead Meme. That's when Mr. Bingley's new hybrid meme format begins to resonate in the Meme-verse, thanks to his students sharing it across the internet. The power of this fresh and relevant meme aids our heroes, reinvigorating them with new strength, showing that old and new can coexist and thrive. The heroes use this newfound power to fight back, and with the help of Mr. Bingley's viral lesson template, they restore the corrupted memes to their former glory. With a collaborative effort, they reach the Source Code and execute a reboot sequence, eliminating The Glitch and saving the Meme-verse. Resolution: With the Meme-verse saved, our heroes return home to a ticker tape parade in their honor, hailed as saviors. The whole experience changes the way memes view trends and obscurity, unifying them stronger than ever. Back in the real world, Mr. Bingley becomes an advocate for integrating modern culture with traditional education. His classroom becomes a breeding ground for a new era of engaged learning, transforming him from the kooky English teacher to the innovative educator beloved by students and memes alike.

I requisiti di sistema per installare e utilizzare VirtualBox possono variare leggermente in base alla versione del software e alla complessità delle macchine virtuali che si intendono eseguire. Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni requisiti di base comuni a molte versioni: 1. Processore: CPU che supporta la virtualizzazione hardware (Intel VT-x/AMD-V). 2. Sistema operativo Host: Windows, macOS, Linux o Solaris. Per le versioni specifiche compatibili, consultare i requisiti del sistema di VirtualBox per la tua versione. 3. Memoria RAM: Almeno 512 MB per VirtualBox stesso, ma si raccomanda almeno 2 GB di RAM oltre alla RAM necessaria per il sistema operativo host per un funzionamento confortevole delle macchine virtuali. 4. Spazio su Disco: Almeno 30 MB per l'installazione di VirtualBox. Lo spazio aggiuntivo è necessario per ogni macchina virtuale e per i dischi virtuali (VDI, VHD, VMDK, etc.) che le VM utilizzeranno, che possono richiedere decine o centinaia di GB ciascuno. 5. Scheda grafica: Una scheda grafica che supporta l'accelerazione 3D può migliorare le prestazioni delle macchine virtuali. 6. Privilegi di amministratore: Per l'installazione e la configurazione di molte funzionalità del software, potrebbero essere necessari privilegi di amministratore sul sistema host. Si noti che se si prevede di utilizzare funzionalità avanzate come la modalità a schermo intero o l'accelerazione 3D, o se si prevede di eseguire macchine virtuali con requisiti di sistema elevati, sarà necessario disporre di hardware più potente sull'host rispetto ai requisiti minimi. Per esempio, se si vuole eseguire una macchina virtuale che richiede 8 GB di RAM e 4 CPU virtuali, sarà necessario disporre di un host con una quantità di RAM e processori superiori, al fine di gestirla senza compromettere la stabilità o le prestazioni del sistema operativo host. Per i requisiti più aggiornati e specifici della versione, è consigliabile consultare la documentazione ufficiale di VirtualBox o i dettagli di rilascio per la versione specifica di VirtualBox che si intende utilizzare."},{"instruction":"Quando crea lo spazio sul disco virtuale è poi possibile ripristinarlo e non sottratto all HD? Come?","output":"Quando crei una nuova macchina virtuale con Oracle VM VirtualBox (o qualsiasi altro software di virtualizzazione), ti viene richiesto di specificare la dimensione di un disco virtuale su cui verrà installato il sistema operativo della macchina virtuale. Questo disco virtuale è in genere rappresentato da un file sul tuo disco fisso dell'host, ad esempio un file con estensione .vdi per VirtualBox. Esistono due tipi principali di dischi virtuali che puoi creare: 1. **Disco con allocazione dinamica (noto anche come \\"espandibile\\")**: La dimensione del disco virtuale cresce quando i dati vi vengono aggiunti, fino a raggiungere la dimensione massima specificata. Di base, il file sul disco fisso inizia piccolo e cresce solo quando necessario. 2. **Disco con allocazione fissa**: La dimensione del file del disco virtuale corrisponde da subito alla dimensione massima del disco virtuale che hai specificato. Questo occupa più spazio sul disco fisso in partenza, ma può essere leggermente più veloce in termini di prestazioni. # Come recuperare spazio sul disco rigido fisico Se vuoi recuperare lo spazio utilizzato da un disco virtuale, hai alcune opzioni: - **Eliminare la macchina virtuale**: Se non hai più bisogno della macchina virtuale, puoi eliminarla. Questo può essere fatto dall'interfaccia utente di VirtualBox. Dovrai anche assicurarti di eliminare i file del disco virtuale associati, che libereranno lo spazio sul disco fisso. - **Ridimensionamento del disco virtuale**: Se il tuo disco virtuale è un disco con allocazione dinamica e contiene molto spazio non utilizzato, puoi tentare di ridurre la sua dimensione. Questo è possibile con l'uso di strumenti come il comando \`VBoxManage modifyhd --compact\` di VirtualBox, ma richiede generalmente che prima deframmenti il disco e poi elimini lo spazio libero all'interno del sistema operativo guest, prima di compattare il disco virtuale nell'host. - **Clonare il disco con meno spazio**: Un'altra opzione è clonare il disco a una dimensione ridotta se hai creato un disco con spazio non completamente utilizzato (disco con allocazione fissa che è in gran parte vuoto, ad esempio). Puoi utilizzare \`VBoxManage clonemedium\` per clonare un disco esistente a una nuova dimensione. Tieni presente che le operazioni su dischi virtuali possono essere avanzate e comportano il rischio di perdere dati. Assicurati sempre di avere backup completi prima di svolgere queste operazioni. In ogni caso, una volta recuperato lo spazio eliminando o riducendo la dimensione dei dischi virtuali, lo spazio viene rilasciato sul disco fisso e può essere utilizato per altri file o scopi sull'host."},{"instruction":"Cancellando la macchina virtuale viene recuperato tutto lo spazio?","output":"Sì, se cancelli la macchina virtuale e assicuri di rimuovere anche tutti i dischi virtuali associati, recupererai tutto lo spazio di archiviazione precedentemente usato dalla macchina virtuale sul tuo disco rigido fisico. Tuttavia, è importante notare che VirtualBox gestisce separatamente le configurazioni delle macchine virtuali (i file XML con estensione \`.vbox\`) e i file di disco virtuale (ad esempio, file con estensione \`.vdi\`, \`.vmdk\`, o \`.vhd\`). Cancellare solamente la configurazione della macchina virtuale dall'interfaccia di VirtualBox non eliminerà automaticamente i file di disco virtuale associati. Questi ultimi rimarranno sul disco fisso finché non saranno eliminati manualmente. Ecco come recuperare lo spazio dopo aver cancellato una macchina virtuale: 1. **Rimuovere la Configurazione della Macchina Virtuale**: Nell'interfaccia di VirtualBox, fai clic destro sulla macchina virtuale in questione e seleziona \\"Rimuovi\\". Scegli di rimuovere solo la macchina virtuale o la macchina virtuale e tutti i file associati, inclusi i dischi virtuali. Se selezioni l'opzione per cancellare tutto, VirtualBox dovrebbe tentare di rimuovere i file di disco virtuale per te. 2. **Eliminare Manualmente i File di Disco Virtuale**: Se per qualche motivo i dischi virtuali non sono stati rimossi o se hai solo rimosso la configurazione della macchina virtuale, dovrai andare manualmente nella directory dove VirtualBox memorizza i file di disco virtuale e cancellarli. Questa directory, di solito, è una cartella chiamata \\"VirtualBox VMs\\" nella tua directory home oppure potrebbe essere una località che hai specificato quando hai creato la macchina virtuale. È importante confermare di aver cancellato tutti i dischi virtuali associati alla macchina virtuale per assicurarti di recuperare effettivamente tutto lo spazio su disco. **Nota bene:** prima di procedere con l'eliminazione di file importanti, assicurati di avere backup dei dati che non vuoi perdere. Eliminare dischi virtuali e macchine virtuali può comportare la perdita permanente di dati se non sei cauto."},{"instruction":"Su un pc AMD X4 5 CORE 16 MB ram e 1 Gb di HD non ssd e scheda di sistema può girare bene una macchina virtuale?","output":"Sì, con le specifiche hardware che hai fornito, dovresti essere in grado di eseguire una macchina virtuale piuttosto bene, ma ci sono alcuni fattori da considerare: 1. **CPU**: Un processore AMD con 5 core dovrebbe fornire una potenza di calcolo sufficiente. Assicurati che il processore supporti la virtualizzazione hardware (AMD-V), che è quasi sempre il caso per i processori moderni, e che questa opzione sia abilitata nel BIOS del sistema. 2. **RAM**: Con 16 GB di RAM, hai abbastanza memoria per allocare RAM sufficiente alla macchina virtuale e mantenere comunque una buona quantità di RAM per il sistema operativo host. La quantità effettiva di RAM che puoi assegnare alla macchina virtuale dipenderà da quanto è consumato dal sistema operativo host e da qualsiasi altra applicazione in esecuzione sull'host. 3. **HD non SSD**: Gli hard disk tradizionali (non SSD) hanno una velocità di lettura/scrittura più lenta rispetto agli SSD, il che significa che potresti percepire tempi di caricamento più lunghi e una performance leggermente ridotta, in particolare se avvii più macchine virtuali contemporaneamente o esegui operazioni su disco intensivo. Tuttavia, con un solo 1 GB di uso per la macchina virtuale, potresti non notare grandi rallentamenti a meno che tu non stia svolgendo attività particolarmente esigenti. 4. **Scheda di sistema**: Non è chiaro cosa intendi con \\"scheda di sistema\\". Se ti riferisci alla scheda madre, basta che sia compatibile con la CPU e che supporti tutti i componenti hardware. Una scheda grafica dedicata non è generalmente necessaria per la virtualizzazione, a meno che tu non intenda utilizzare la macchina virtuale per giochi o applicazioni che richiedono un'intensa grafica 3D. L'importante è configurare la macchina virtuale in modo appropriato, assegnando abbastanza risorse per il sistema operativo guest senza sovraccaricare il sistema host. È anche importante mantenere il sistema operativo host ottimizzato e senza troppo carico per assicurarsi che le performance non siano degradate mentre esegue macchine virtuali. Poiché hai menzionato 1 GB di HD, penso che possa esserci un errore di digitazione, in quanto sarebbe molto poco spazio per un'installazione moderna di qualsiasi sistema operativo, sia per l'host che per la macchina virtuale. Se in realtà hai molto più spazio di archiviazione (ad esempio, 1 TB), allora non dovresti avere problemi di spazio. Assicurati di avere abbastanza spazio libero sul disco per la macchina virtuale e per le sue esigenze future."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post about Skibidi Toilet","output":"Title: The Skibidi Toilet: The Ultimate Fusion of Technology and Fun in Your Bathroom!

Synopsis: In the world of the internet, memes have lives and communities of their own. The classic memes, who are now considered \\"veterans\\" of the digital era, live in peace, reminiscing about the days they ruled the web. Characters like Nyan Cat, Trollface, Bad Luck Brian, Grumpy Cat, and others enjoy their retirement in MemeLand, where they're visited by meme-lovers. However, their peaceful existence is disrupted by the rise of a modern, ear-worm meme known as Skibidi Toilet, a jarring figure that pops out of toilets singing an extremely cringe-worthy tune. Skibidi's song has a mind-controlling effect, causing anyone who hears it to become obsessed with sharing it, causing havoc across the web and overpowering other memes in popularity. When Skibidi Toilet's power becomes too great, a council of meme elders decides that action must be taken. They call upon the most iconic and clever memes to come together and form a team to stop Skibidi Toilet before it completely erases the essence of classic meme culture. The team, led by the once-wisecracking, now-serious Doge, includes the Overly Attached Girlfriend, who's determined to cling to the internet's sanity; Success Kid, who's up for any challenge; and the Philosoraptor, with his deep thoughts and problem-solving abilities.

The film is a testament to the creativity and humor of internet culture, stressing that it's the people who love and share memes who keep this unique form of communication alive and thriving."},{"instruction":"Write simple Bitcoin wallet on Python","output":"Creating a basic Bitcoin wallet in Python involves several steps that go beyond constructing a fully functional wallet as seen in commercial applications. Nonetheless, I can guide you through creating a simple wallet that will generate a new Bitcoin address that can receive funds. Please note that this example doesn't cover sending Bitcoin or interacting with the blockchain network to check balances and transaction history. We will use the \`bitcoin\` library in Python to streamline the wallet creation process. Make sure to install the library using pip before proceeding: \`\`\`bash pip install bitcoin \`\`\` Here's the code for a simple Bitcoin wallet: \`\`\`python from bitcoin import * # Generate a private key private_key = random_key() # Display the private key (keep this secret!) print(\\"Private Key:\\", private_key) # Generate the public key public_key = privtopub(private_key) # Display public key print(\\"Public Key:\\", public_key) # Generate a Bitcoin address from the public key bitcoin_address = pubtoaddr(public_key) # Display the Bitcoin address print(\\"Bitcoin Address (Receive funds at this address):\\", bitcoin_address) \`\`\` This script generates a Bitcoin private key, derives the public key from the private key, and then creates a Bitcoin address from the public key. Note that private keys should be kept confidential, as anyone with access to it can take control of the Bitcoins associated with the corresponding address. Also, this is a very basic example that can be further expanded with more functionality, such as: - Checking the balance of the wallet (requires API integration with a service that provides blockchain information). - Sending Bitcoin to another address (requires signing transactions and understanding UTXOs). - Properly securing the private key (using encryption/secure storage). To create a more secure and user-friendly wallet, you would have to implement additional features and adhere to several best practices that are beyond the scope of this simple example."},{"instruction":"перефразируй Not too red and not too brown - just the right hue to get those autumn vibes in.

The growth rate of DAU dropped 8% and MAU dropped 5%. Analyze the story behind the data. Try to solve this question with focus on the dimension of the data.","output":"When analyzing a drop in Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU), it's critical to consider several dimensions of the data and broader contextual factors to understand the story behind these figures. Here are some dimensions and potential factors to explore: 1. **Temporal Dimension**: Look at the time period over which the decline occurred. Was it gradual or sudden? A gradual decline might indicate users gradually losing interest or a shift towards competitors. A sudden drop could be due to a significant event or the introduction of a buggy update. 2. **Geographical Dimension**: Investigate if the decline is across all regions or concentrated in specific areas. This could indicate local competitors, regulatory issues, or changes in consumer preferences. 3. **User Segmentation Dimension**: Analyze the data by user demographics such as age, gender, or interests. Certain user segments might be declining — perhaps younger users are flocking to a newer platform or a feature particular to one demographic is underperforming. 4. **Device/Platform Dimension**: Determine if the drop is tied to specific platforms. An update or change on iOS or Android, or issues with particular devices could impact DAU and MAU. 5. **Feature Utilization Dimension**: Examine if changes in the use of specific features correlate with the drop. New feature rollouts that users don't like, removing popular features, or technical issues with key features can significantly impact user engagement. 6. **Competitive Landscape Dimension**: Consider the broader market context. If a competing app released a substantial update or a new player entered the market with disruptive features, users might shift their attention away from Meta Messenger. 7. **External Events Dimension**: Look for external factors such as data breaches, public relations issues, or global events that might make users less active or abandon the platform. 8. **Cohort Dimension**: Analyze the groups of users who started using the app at the same time. If a particular cohort's engagement is declining, it could indicate lifecycle fatigue or a specific update that didn't resonate with that group. In each dimension, you will want to: - **Gather Data**: Collect quantitative and qualitative data like user surveys, interviews, app store reviews, social media sentiment, and usage analytics to gain insights. - **Analyze Trends**: Look for patterns in the data that may help explain the decline in DAU and MAU. - **Propose Hypotheses**: Based on the analysis, come up with potential reasons for the decline. - **Validate Hypotheses**: Test your hypotheses by further data collection or experimenting with changes to the app. - **Develop Action Steps**: Once you have a better understanding of the issue, initiate changes to address the underlying causes. Overall, the key is to triangulate the data with broader business and market intelligence to paint a comprehensive picture of why usage is declining and then address those issues systematically."},{"instruction":"what metrics can use for evaluate this DAU and MAU drop?","output":"When evaluating a drop in DAU (Daily Active Users) and MAU (Monthly Active Users), several metrics can be used to identify underlying issues and measure the impact of those issues. Here are some key metrics to consider: 1. **Retention Rates**: This measures how well you retain users over time. If the retention rate is decreasing, it could be indicative of a problem with user satisfaction or engagement. 2. **Churn Rate**: The opposite of retention, the churn rate measures how many users are leaving or stop using the app. A high churn rate can be a clear indicator of problems with the product or user experience. 3. **Engagement Metrics**: Metrics such as session length, number of sessions per user, and actions taken per session can give insights into how engaged users are with the app. A decline in these metrics could explain a decrease in DAU/MAU. 4. **User Acquisition Rates**: It's essential to measure how many new users you're acquiring and how they compare to the number of users you're losing. A decrease in user acquisition could lead to a decrease in MAU. 5. **Cohort Analysis**: Analyze the behavior of groups of users who joined around the same time. This can help identify if certain events or updates have impacted user retention differently across cohorts. 6. **Stickiness**: This is a measure of how often users return to the app, typically calculated by dividing DAU by MAU (DAU/MAU). A decline in this ratio indicates a decline in how habitual the app usage is for the audience. 7. **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) or Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: These surveys give direct feedback from users about how they feel about your product. Drops here can be a leading indicator of potential future drops in DAU/MAU. 8. **Reactivation Rates**: Measures the success of efforts to bring back users who have lapsed or become less active. 9. **Conversion Rates**: Looks at the percentage of users who are taking a desired action, like signing up for a premium account or completing a profile. A drop here could indirectly impact DAU/MAU if these actions are correlated with long-term engagement. 10. **Revenue Metrics**: If the app's revenue is user-dependent (such as ad revenue, in-app purchases, or subscriptions), observing a drop here can also reflect issues with DAU/MAU. 11. **Competitive Metrics**: Monitoring the growth and engagement metrics of competitors can provide context to whether the drop is an industry trend or specific to your app. 12. **Event Tracking**: Specific in-app events can be tracked to see if there are particular features or updates that correlate with the decrease in usage. This can involve funnel analysis to see where users are dropping off. 13. **User Feedback**: Analysis of reviews, support tickets, and direct user feedback can provide qualitative insights into users' sentiments and possible reasons for disengagement. Understanding these metrics can often reveal much more about the health and sustainability of a product than DAU and MAU alone. When one observes a drop in DAU and MAU, it is important to dive deeper using these metrics to get to the root of the problem, and to tailor a response that's informed by comprehensive user and product insights."},{"instruction":"Please group above metrics and prioritize all groups.","output":"To effectively group and prioritize the metrics for evaluating a drop in DAU and MAU, we can organize them into three main categories: User Engagement, User Retention, and Business Health. Prioritization can depend on the specific context and business goals, but generally, a balanced approach is important to understand the issue from multiple angles. Here is a way to group and prioritize these categories and their associated metrics: 1. **User Engagement** (High Priority) - **Engagement Metrics**: Session length, number of sessions per user, and actions per session. Key to understanding how users interact with the app on a daily basis. - **Stickiness**: DAU/MAU ratio as a direct measure of how habit-forming the app is. - **Event Tracking / Funnel Analysis**: To identify where users may be experiencing friction or losing interest. - **Conversion Rates**: Indicative of user willingness to take desired actions that can also feed into retention. 2. **User Retention** (High Priority) - **Retention Rates**: Analysis over various intervals (e.g., day 1, day 7, day 30) will give insights into when users drop off and how well the app is maintaining its user base over time. - **Churn Rate**: The flip side of retention, it identifies how many users are leaving, which is crucial for understanding long-term sustainability. - **Cohort Analysis**: Provides nuanced insights into the retention of specific user groups over time and in response to changes or updates. - **Reactivation Rates**: Success rate in bringing back users who have gone inactive or churned. 3. **Business Health** (Medium Priority) - **Revenue Metrics**: A reflection of the app's ability to monetize its user base and a vital consideration for the financial sustainability of the product. - **User Acquisition Rates**: New user growth is essential but may be considered reactive if there's a fundamental issue affecting current user retention and engagement. - **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) or Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: While important, they might be less immediate than behavioral metrics but essential for long-term product health and user retention. - **User Feedback**: Qualitative data from reviews and support tickets can provide actionable insights and should inform interpretations of other metrics. - **Competitive Metrics**: Keep an eye on the competitive landscape to benchmark performance and understand industry trends. When setting priorities, one should focus on metrics that provide the quickest insight into user behavior changes and direct product issues (Engagement, Retention). Business Health metrics are necessary for long-term strategy and health but might have a less direct correlation to DAU/MAU decline. However, this prioritization is not static. Depending on the insights you gather initially, you might need to shift focus and resources to different areas. It's also important to note that these metrics do not exist in isolation; they're interrelated, and changes in one can affect others. A comprehensive, data-informed approach is always the best course of action."},{"instruction":"Give a more detailed instruction.","output":"Certainly. To respond effectively to a decline in DAU and MAU, a structured analytical approach is necessary.

Give me the possible reason why DAU/MAU is dropped.","output":"Based on the metrics provided earlier, here are some possible reasons for a decline in DAU and MAU for Meta Messenger or any messaging app: # 1. User Engagement Decline: - **Decreased Session Length/Frequency**: Users might find less value in the app, maybe due to a lack of innovative features or poor user experience compared to competitors. - **Lower Conversion Rates**: This could indicate that recent updates or new features aren’t resonating with users or that key features are hidden or difficult to use. - **Event Tracking Showing Drop-Offs**: If users are consistently abandoning the app at certain points, it could point to UX problems, confusing interface, feature malfunctions, or lack of compelling content at those stages. # 2. User Retention Issues: - **Lower Retention Rates**: This might suggest that the app isn't retaining its user base over time, which could be due to the novelty wearing off, better alternatives available, or a negative experience with the app. - **Higher Churn Rates**: An increase in churn could be caused by user dissatisfaction, privacy concerns, or the app failing to engage users long-term. - **Poor Reactivation Success**: Reactivation campaigns are not effectively winning back former users, possibly due to inadequate incentives or unresolved issues that caused users to leave in the first place. # 3. Business Health Concerns: - **Reduced Revenue**: This could suggest users are less willing to pay for services, view ads, or make in-app purchases, possibly due to economic factors, perceived lack of value, or an increase in free alternatives. - **Slower User Acquisition**: New user growth may be stalling due to poor market positioning, ineffective marketing, or a saturated market. - **Negative CSAT or NPS Scores**: Reflect a general dissatisfaction among users, which could predict a decline in user engagement and retention. - **Poor User Feedback**: Reviews and support tickets that signal widespread complaints about functionality, privacy issues, bugs, or poor customer service can drive users away. # 4. External Factors: - **Increased Competition**: New or revamped competitor apps offering more attractive features or user experiences can lure users away. - **Market Saturation**: In mature markets, most potential users might already be using the app, leading to growth stagnation. - **Changing Market Trends**: Users’ preferences could be shifting towards different modes of communication, like ephemeral content or video calls, which are not Meta Messenger’s primary functions. - **Regulatory Challenges**: New regulations or privacy concerns might lead to users choosing alternative apps in certain regions. - **Technological Changes**: Shifts in the device landscape (such as the rise of new mobile operating systems) could leave the app incompatible or suboptimal for certain users, leading to decreased activity. - **Seasonal Variations**: There can be natural fluctuations in usage due to holidays, events, or seasonal changes which could affect DAU/MAU numbers. # 5. Product-Specific Challenges: - **Recent Updates or Bugs**: If an update was released before the drop, it's worth exploring whether it introduced bugs, removed beloved features, or changed the user interface significantly in an unwelcome way. - **Privacy and Data Security Concerns**: Data breaches or news reports about privacy concerns can have a sudden and significant impact on user trust and engagement with the app. For Meta Messenger specifically, considering any news announcements, company reports, changes to the app, or shifts in social media and communication trends would be critical in identifying the cause of dropping DAU/MAU. Analyzing user and market data within these frameworks can guide the process of identifying the root causes and crafting strategic responses."},{"instruction":"Based on dimensions and potential factors to explore, Give me the story behind this growth rate change?","output":"To craft a narrative behind the change in growth rates for DAU and MAU, we must synthesize potential factors within the different dimensions we discussed previously. Let’s explore an illustrative story that takes into account these dimensions. **Temporal Dimension**: Over the past quarter, we've observed that the DAU of Meta Messenger has declined by 8%, and the MAU by 5%. This decrease in user activity could be a gradual trend or a reaction to a specific event. For instance, it might correlate with the rollout of a new app update or a known external event that is impacting user behavior. **Geographical Dimension**: If the decline is concentrated in specific regions, it could indicate locally emerging competitors or new government regulations affecting app usage. Perhaps a new messaging app has become popular in certain markets due to localized features or better integration with regional social networks. **User Segmentation Dimension**: Analysis shows younger users are migrating towards newer platforms with features that resonate more with their lifestyle, like ephemeral content or advanced gamification. This would affect DAU as younger demographics tend to be daily active users. **Device/Platform Dimension**: Further data reveals issues predominantly affecting Android users due to a problematic update that slipped through quality assurance, causing crashes and slower performance on widely used devices which contribute heavily to DAU/MAU figures. **Feature Utilization Dimension**: Key features that drove daily usage, such as group video calls, have seen a decline in reliability. User feedback indicates frustration, pushing people to seek alternatives for regular communication, thus impacting DAU. **Competitive Landscape Dimension**: Competitor analysis has noted that during this period, a rival app launched an aggressive marketing campaign and unveiled compelling features, acquiring a significant number of new users from the market share, which may account for some loss in MAU. **External Events Dimension**: There have been recent public concerns over data privacy, and Meta Messenger was highlighted in a couple of high-profile discussions around data management. This could have prompted a trust issue, leading to a slow but steady decline in user activity. **Cohort Dimension**: Looking at cohort behavior, we see that users who joined in the past six months have a lower retention rate than earlier cohorts, pointing toward a possible issue with onboarding or user engagement for new users. **Synthesizing the Story**: Meta Messenger's DAU and MAU have been adversely affected by a combination of internal and external factors. Internally, a flawed update has significantly impacted the user experience, particularly on Android devices, leading to performance issues that affect daily usage. Meanwhile, feature reliability problems have dented the app's reputation for core communication tools. Externally, younger user segments are tempted away by competitors offering novel functionalities, while privacy concerns have dampened trust among the broader user base. Seasonal variations and regional competitor growth have also played roles, with certain markets experiencing acute drops maybe due to local events or changes in user preferences. The overall competitive landscape has shifted with rivals making strategic moves to capture market share, both through feature innovation and targeted marketing campaigns. Lastly, issues in user acquisition and retention strategies may have come to the fore, with more recent user cohorts exhibiting lower engagement and retention metrics compared to established users, highlighting potential gaps in the onboarding process or the evolving product-market fit. In response to these challenges, Meta Messenger might need to prioritize efforts on several fronts, including fixing technical issues, re-engaging with the user base on privacy issues, improving user retention particularly in younger demographics, innovating with new features, and recalibrating marketing and onboarding strategies."},{"instruction":"how about deep dive in impact of operating platforms ? such as desktop vs mobile? Android vs IOS?","output":"To deeply investigate the impact of operating platforms on the drop in DAU and MAU, we would conduct a platform-specific analysis. Here's what that could look like for Meta Messenger: # Mobile vs. Desktop - **Usage Patterns**: First, we'd study the differences in usage patterns between mobile and desktop users. Messaging apps typically have higher usage on mobile due to the convenience of smartphones. A decline in mobile usage could disproportionately impact overall DAU/MAU. - **Feature Parity**: We'd examine whether features such as video calling or instant messaging are equally accessible and performant across mobile and desktop platforms. Desktop users might face limitations if features are mobile-first. - **User Experience**: A comparative analysis of the user experience across platforms could uncover if recent updates negatively affected one platform over the other. # Android vs. iOS - **Update Rollouts**: Any recent updates or changes in the app might not have been received equally well across the two platforms. Perhaps an update introduced a bug on Android, resulting in crashes, which discouraged daily use. - **Market Share**: The market share of Android vs. iOS in different regions could affect the impact on DAU/MAU. A significant drop in a platform with a larger user base would have a more pronounced effect. - **App Store Reviews**: Sentiments in Google Play Store and Apple App Store reviews could indicate platform-specific issues. If negative reviews spike for one platform, it would warrant closer attention. # Deep Dive Analysis 1. **Performance Metrics per Platform**: Analyze app performance metrics like crash rates, load times, and error rates on each platform. A higher crash rate on Android, for example, could lead to a bigger drop in DAU if Android has a larger user base. 2. **Feature Utilization**: Break down feature usage by platform to identify if certain features underperform or are neglected by users on desktop or one of the mobile OS platforms. 3. **User Feedback and Support Tickets**: Categorize and scrutinize user feedback by platform. Higher volumes of complaints or support tickets from one platform could indicate systemic issues affecting the user experience and, in turn, DAU/MAU. 4. **Update Adoption and Reaction**: Review the update adoption rate per platform and user reactions to those updates, as problematic updates can cause immediate drops in usage. Check if one platform's users are more resistant or reactive to updates. 5. **Device Compatibility**: Consider the wide range of Android devices and the compatibility of your app with different hardware specs, screen sizes, and OS versions. Issues here can lead to negative experiences for a significant portion of users, thereby affecting DAU/MAU. 6. **Technical Limitations**: Explore technical constraints that may exist on desktop versions or within certain mobile operating systems that could hinder feature development or performance optimizations. 7. **Monetization Features**: If the app's monetization features (ads, in-app purchases) perform differently or are perceived differently across platforms, this could influence user engagement and retention. 8. **External Factors**: Identify any external circumstances specific to platforms, such as changes in app store policies or platform-specific privacy/scandal news. # Formulating Insights By diving deep into these platform-specific metrics and examining the data, we can extract insights that direct us to the root causes of the decline in DAU/MAU. For instance, if Android users are experiencing more crashes and the bulk of your user base uses Android, the decline in DAU/MAU might be largely attributed to that issue. Ensuring the app provides a stellar and equitable experience across all platforms and addressing any platform-specific problems should be a priority. Potential actions could include prompt bug fixes, revisiting update deployment strategies, or enhancing cross-platform feature parity."},{"instruction":"Question 2: Give a 'user_log' table with four columns: userid: int timestamp: datetime action: enum {“login”, “send”, “update”} client: enum {“android”, “iOS”, “desktop”} Build SQL Query to get daily data, such as DAU, send count, iOS send count, daily new user","output":"To get the daily data such as DAU (Daily Active Users), send count, iOS send count, and daily new user count, we need to build SQL queries that can aggregate data over these different dimensions. I'm assuming we're using a SQL database that supports standard SQL functions and syntax. Here are some queries that will provide us with the required metrics: # Daily Active Users (DAU) \`\`\`sql SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(DISTINCT userid) AS DAU FROM user_log WHERE action = 'login' GROUP BY date; \`\`\` This query gives us the count of unique users who logged in each day. # Send Count \`\`\`sql SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(*) AS send_count FROM user_log WHERE action = 'send' GROUP BY date; \`\`\` This query sums up the total number of 'send' actions for each day. # iOS Send Count \`\`\`sql SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(*) AS ios_send_count FROM user_log WHERE action = 'send' AND client = 'iOS' GROUP BY date; \`\`\` This query shows the total count of 'send' actions for each day performed on the iOS client. # Daily New User Count For this metric, we need to identify when a user first appears in the logs and count those as new users. Assuming that the 'login' action represents a new user when it first appears: \`\`\`sql WITH FirstLogin AS ( SELECT userid, MIN(DATE(timestamp)) AS first_login_date FROM user_log WHERE action = 'login' GROUP BY userid ) SELECT first_login_date AS date, COUNT(userid) AS new_user_count FROM FirstLogin GROUP BY first_login_date; \`\`\` This query will give us the number of new users for each day. # Combined Query If we want to combine all of these metrics into a single query, we can use this SQL query: \`\`\`sql WITH FirstLogin AS ( SELECT userid, MIN(DATE(timestamp)) AS first_login_date FROM user_log WHERE action = 'login' GROUP BY userid ), DailySend AS ( SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(*) AS send_count FROM user_log WHERE action = 'send' GROUP BY date ), iOSDailySend AS ( SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(*) AS ios_send_count FROM user_log WHERE action = 'send' AND client = 'iOS' GROUP BY date ), DailyLogins AS ( SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(DISTINCT userid) AS DAU FROM user_log WHERE action = 'login' GROUP BY date ) SELECT COALESCE(DL.date, DS.date, IDS.date, FL.first_login_date) AS date, COALESCE(DAU, 0) AS DailyActiveUsers, COALESCE(send_count, 0) AS SendCount, COALESCE(ios_send_count, 0) AS iOSSendCount, COALESCE(new_user_count, 0) AS NewUserCount FROM DailyLogins DL FULL OUTER JOIN DailySend DS ON DL.date = DS.date FULL OUTER JOIN iOSDailySend IDS ON DL.date = IDS.date FULL OUTER JOIN FirstLogin FL ON DL.date = FL.first_login_date ORDER BY date; \`\`\` This combined query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the metrics individually and then brings them together with a FULL OUTER JOIN to create a complete daily summary report. It uses the \`COALESCE\` function to ensure that we get \`0\` where there are no records rather than \`NULL\`. If your database system doesn't support \`FULL OUTER JOIN\` (like MySQL), you would need to find an alternative method to join these subqueries, such as using \`UNION\` with conditional aggregation. Please note that these queries make some assumptions about how the user_log table records data. The final implementation may require adjustments depending on the specifics of your logging system, the meaning of an action (like whether the 'login' action is the correct indicator of a new user), and the SQL dialect of your database."},{"instruction":"Napisz jak przedstawiała się sowiecka strefa wpływów w Europie i w jakich okolicznościach doszło do jej utworzenia i instalowania władz komunistycznych na tych terenach","output":"Sowiecka strefa wpływów w Europie, znana też jako blok wschodni, powstała po zakończeniu II wojny światowej, gdy Związek Radziecki zajął całą Europę Wschodnią oraz część Europy Środkowej. Sowieckie strefy wpływów były wynikiem ustaleń jałtańskich i poczdamskich, w których władze Związku Radzieckiego, Stanów Zjednoczonych i Wielkiej Brytanii zdecydowały o przyszłym układzie politycznym w regionie. Instalacja władz komunistycznych na tych terenach następowała stopniowo przez kilka lat po wojnie. 1. Konferencje wojenne aliantów: Na konferencjach w Teheranie (1943), Jałcie (luty 1945) oraz Poczdamie (lipiec-sierpień 1945) liderzy państw alianckich – Józef Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt i Winston Churchill (a później Harry S. Truman) – uzgadniali podział stref wpływów w powojennej Europie. 2. Zakończenie II wojny światowej: Po zakończeniu wojny w Europie w maju 1945 roku armie radzieckie znajdowały się na terytoriach państw od wschodnich granic Niemiec po środkową Europę. Ich obecność w tych krajach stworzyła warunki do instalacji rządów komunistycznych lojalnych wobec Związku Radzieckiego. 3. Komunistyczna dominacja: W wielu krajach Europy Środkowej i Wschodniej instalacja władz komunistycznych nastąpiła stopniowo, często przez zorganizowane „wybory”, które były fałszowane w celu zapewnienia komunistom przewagi. Nierzadko dochodziło do prześladowań i eliminacji innych sił politycznych, w tym prawicowych i centrowych partii politycznych. 4. Rządy jednopartyjne: W konsekwencji na przełomie lat 40. i 50. we wschodniej Europie utworzono rządy jednopartyjne, w których władzę sprawowała lokalna komunistyczna partia, działająca pod ścisłą kontrolą ZSRR. W państwach tych zastosowano model gospodarczy wzorowany na systemie sowieckim, centralnie planowanej gospodarce. 5. Powstawanie bloku wschodniego: Państwa te zostały włączone w struktury bloku wschodniego, tworząc polityczny i militarny sojusz w postaci Układu Warszawskiego (1955) oraz ekonomiczny skupiony wokół RWPG – Rady Wzajemnej Pomocy Gospodarczej (1949). W skład sowieckiej strefy wpływów w Europie wchodziły kraje takie jak Polska, Czechosłowacja, Węgry, Rumunia, Bułgaria, NRD (Niemiecka Republika Demokratyczna), a od 1940 roku także kraje bałtyckie – Litwa, Łotwa i Estonia. Sowiecka strefa wpływów charakteryzowała się ograniczeniem suwerenności, represyjnym systemem politycznym, cenzurą, kontrolą społeczeństwa przez tajną policję i podporządkowaniem gospodarki dyrektywom ZSRR. Instalowanie władz komunistycznych odbywało się często z naruszeniem deklarowanych zasad demokracji i samostanowienia narodów, co prowadziło do wielu konfliktów wewnętrznych, powstań (jak np. węgierskie powstanie 1956 roku, praska wiosna 1968) i napięć międzynarodowych, będąc jednym z głównych czynników rozpoczęcia Zimnej Wojny."},{"instruction":"Write a Roblox movie called \\"The Roblox Movie\\" which involves an average Robloxian becoming a Chosen One, and it is a parody of another animated film","output":"Title: The Roblox Noob's Epic Quest: The Roblox Movie Act 1: Noob-Life Crisis Fade in on the blocky, virtual land of Robloxia—a world where possibilities are endless and avatars roam free through various minigames and creations built by the minds of its citizens. Our \\"hero,\\" Noobly—an average Robloxian wearing the classic blue shirt and simple smile—logs in to find his mundane Roblox life just isn't cutting it. Noobly's dream is to become someone worthy of admiration. The screen splits, showcasing side-by-side Robloxian life mirroring a painfully average real-world character, Alex, sitting at his desk, itching for adventure. Suddenly, there's a glitch—a shimmering, pulsating ripple in the world of Robloxia. A strange figure in a hoodie and shades, known only as The Coder, appears on Noobly's screen, proclaiming him \\"The Blocky One,\\" destined to save Robloxia from impending doom. A pixelated scroll unfolds, parodying the lion king's circle of life but with Robloxian-style assembly kits. Act 2: The Glitch and the Glitch-Breaker Noobly is reluctant but intrigued by the notion of becoming something more. The Coder reveals that a malignant virus, The Glitch, is wreaking havoc, corrupting games, and trapping users in endless loops of bugs and errors. Clips parody \\"The Matrix,\\" with The Coder performing exaggerated, blocky backflips and handing Noobly a digital \\"chosen-one\\" toolset. \\"With these, you can manipulate the source blocks of Robloxia itself,\\" declares The Coder. Our Noobly, determined to find his purpose, takes up the call to action—queue training montage with moments spoofing everything from \\"Rocky\\" to \\"Kung Fu Panda.\\" The Glitch, a swirling mass of corrupted code with a villainous, archaic computer voice, taunts Noobly, parodying clichéd baddies like Scar from \\"The Lion King.\\" Act 3: Assemble the Squad (Brick by Brick) Noobly realizes he can't face the Glitch alone; he must assemble a team of unique, skilled, albeit stereotypical, allies. There's Builda, a master constructor, spoofing Emmet from \\"The Lego Movie\\"; PwnZor, the elite gamer, parodying Shrek's swagger; and Glitchie, a former virus turned sassy sidekick a la Donkey, chuckling in binary code. The unlikely band traverses the ever-changing landscapes of Robloxia, from Obby Oases to Tycoon Towns. Dramatically overblown challenges await, featuring playful nods to classic movie tropes—chases spoofing \\"Indiana Jones,\\" melodramatic \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\\" showdowns, and dance-off battles that mock \\"Guardians of the Galaxy.\\" Act 4: Remix the Resolution As the final confrontation approaches, The Glitch captures The Coder, morphing the landscape into a glitchy dystopia, resembling a mix between the agony of Mordor and the eccentricity of the \\"Mad Max\\" universe. Noobly's team launches into an elaborate rescue operation spoofing \\"Mission Impossible\\" and \\"Star Wars'\\" Death Star assault. In a clashing crescendo, Noobly faces The Glitch, wielding his toolset, and engaging in a comical, slow-motion, \\"300\\"-style battle. The screen displays RPG-style power-ups and hit points during the clash. Utilizing a Robloxian update patch, Noobly exploits the core assumption of the virus—\\"that errors must persist\\"—and traps it in a logic paradox, saving Robloxia. Act 5: Glitches and Blocky Endings The Glitch dissipates, and Robloxia returns to normal, but with a newfound appreciation for Noobly. The Coder nods in approval, disappearing with the promise that Noobly may be needed again, hinting at a sequel with a \\"Terminator\\"-themed \\"I'll be back.\\" Noobly is celebrated as a hero, cueing a parade that parodies Disney's \\"Main Street Electrical Parade,\\" with pixelated fireworks and jubilant avatars, as the screen fades to black. The credits roll, featuring bloopers and a catchy pop-block song. End Scene: Alex logs off with a satisfied smirk, his longing for adventure quelled—for now. The camera pans out to see the Roblox logo on his monitor, hinting at a new day for both Alex and Noobly, with adventures just waiting to be clicked."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post saying they think Toy Story, Gnomeo and Juliet and The Lego Movie take place in the same universe","output":"Title: The Unexpected Shared Universe of Toy Story, Gnomeo & Juliet, and The Lego Movie In the world of cinematic experiences, moviegoers have delighted in discovering interconnected universes that link their favorite films, creating a richer and more immersive tapestry of storytelling. It's no secret that studios like Marvel have masterfully crafted such realms, drawing audiences into a cohesive saga of superheroes and interrelated narratives. However, an unexpected shared universe might be hiding in plain sight, intertwining the whimsical adventures of Toy Story, the charming escapades of Gnomeo & Juliet, and the boundlessly creative world of The Lego Movie. In this exploration, we will delve into the playful possibility that these beloved animated tales coexist within the same cinematic universe. **The Common Thread: Living Objects in a Human World** At the heart of each of these endearing films is the imaginative concept that the inanimate can come to life when humans aren't looking. In Toy Story, toys have their own society, feelings, and aspirations, mirroring the human world while existing just outside of our perception. Gnomeo & Juliet transports the same idea into the realm of garden ornaments, which lead hidden lives filled with love, rivalry, and adventure. Similarly, The Lego Movie showcases Lego minifigures and constructions as sentient beings in a vibrant, blocky universe assembled from the creativity of the people who play with them. **The Seamless Integration: How They Could Coexist** While it might seem far-fetched to imagine a peaceful cohabitation of toys, gnomes, and Lego characters, there are subtle threads that could bind their worlds seamlessly. Firstly, consider the setting - each of these stories unfolds in an ordinary, human-centric world. It's not hard to imagine that Andy's backyard from Toy Story exists in the same neighborhood as the gardens where Gnomeo & Juliet find their romance. Meanwhile, the basement of The Lego Movie's human world, where the Lego universe is built and played with, could easily be a stone's throw away. **Easter Eggs and Potential Crossovers** Even though these films were produced by different studios, it's a fun exercise for fans to comb through the movies and search for easter eggs that might hint at overlaps. For instance, think of a moment where a Lego brick could be seen in Andy's room, or perhaps a miniaturized Lego version of Buzz Lightyear sitting in Emmet's construction site. Additionally, the concept of garden gnomes as merchandise or collectibles in the Toy Story universe isn't far-fetched, nor is the idea of Lego sets modeled after garden scenes in The Lego Movie. These kinds of crossovers could slyly suggest that the characters of these separate films are more connected than we initially thought. **The Philosophical Underpinning: Reflections of Ourselves** Beyond the whimsical conjecture of shared universes, these films share a more profound thematic connection—they each reflect aspects of human nature and society. Toys, gnomes, and Lego minifigures act out human dramas, embody anthropomorphic emotions, and confront challenges akin to those we face. The interconnectedness of these movies might be more about the shared human experience they represent, told through the metaphor of living toys and characters. The films challenge viewers to look at everyday objects through a lens of wonder and consider the human impulse to find life, narrative, and meaning in the nonliving. **Conclusion: A Playful Theory Worth Toy-ing With** While there's no official confirmation that Toy Story, Gnomeo & Juliet, and The Lego Movie exist within the same universe, the very notion is an invitation to the imagination. It celebrates a collective spirit of playfulness and creativity, reminding us that the boundaries of storytelling are as limitless as the mind's ability to dream. Whether these films truly share cinematic space or simply resonate with similar themes, they continue to charm audiences by bringing the inanimate to life and inspiring us to see our world through a lens of endless possibility. Until the studios decide to join forces and bring this playful theory to life, fans of Toy Story, Gnomeo & Juliet, and The Lego Movie can continue to revel in the magic of their respective universes—and perhaps imagine a day when Woody might tip his hat to a passing Gnomeo, or Emmet Brickowski might build a world where they can all exist together."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Different style guides have different rules. In most cases, especially in informal writing, it's common to add a space after an ellipsis before beginning the next word for clarity. Here's an example: Correct (with space): \\"I'm not sure what to do... I'll think about it.\\" Incorrect (without space): \\"I'm not sure what to do...I'll think about it.\\" However, in formal writing or when following certain style guides like the Chicago Manual of Style, you would typically use a closed-up ellipsis (three dots with no spaces between) and then a space before the next word. For example, you might see something like this: \\"I'm not sure... I'll think about it.\\" In typography and more professional typesetting, there may be additional considerations, such as using an ellipsis character (…) that is treated as a single character rather than typing three periods with or without spaces. It's always a good idea to consult a specific style guide if you're writing for publication or in an academic context, as expectations can vary."},{"instruction":"cum pot folosi un eufemism pentru \\"cutie de prezervatifve\\"","output":"Un eufemism este o formulare mai puțin directă sau mai puțin ofensivă folosită pentru a descrie ceva ce ar putea fi considerat nepoliticos sau indiscret.

Lovecraft era conhecido pelo seu estilo de escrita gótico e sombrio, com ênfase em temas de terror cósmico e o desconhecido. Não era típico em sua obra o uso de palavrões ou linguagem obscena, pois ele mantinha um tom mais formal e literário em seus textos. Na verdade, Lovecraft era bastante meticuloso em sua escolha de palavras e seu vocabulário era extenso. Seu estilo era arcaizante e ele freqüentemente usava palavras e frases que davam um ar de antiguidade à sua prosa. É importante também notar que Lovecraft viveu durante um período (1890-1937) em que a censura e os valores sociais em relação à linguagem eram muito mais rígidos do que os padrões contemporâneos. Portanto, você não encontrará palavrões \\"modernos\\" nos trabalhos de Lovecraft. Seus textos tendem a criar horror através da sugestão e da descrição de atmosferas e de seres indescritíveis, e não através de choque ou vulgaridade direta. Se você está interessado em aprender mais sobre o vocabulário e as técnicas estilísticas de Lovecraft, recomendaria concentrar-se em como ele constrói suas narrativas enigmáticas e que evocam o medo do desconhecido e do insondável.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell from a penalty of -50% to a +5o% bonus. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my list of spells is revised to less complex and more juvenile spells. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My starting set of spells. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the grand arena of Enchanted Ascent, where Sapphire, the distinguished 16-year-old champion of magic dueling in the teen division, stands poised to face off against an improbable challenger—Lily, the 6-year-old prodigy. **Starting Stats** Sapphire (Age 16): - Spell Power: 95/100 - Performance: 90/100 Lily (Age 6): - Spell Power: 55/100 - Performance: 60/100 **Complex Exponential Formula for Stat Changes** Each round, the stat changes occur as follows: - Sapphire's Spell Power and Performance decrease, and Lily's increase by: - 📉 ΔStat_Sapphire = CurrentStat_Sapphire * (0.8^AgeDifference) * Complexity_Modifier - 📈 ΔStat_Lily = CurrentStat_Lily * (1.2^(AgeDifference/2)) * Complexity_Modifier - AgeDifference is recalculated each turn after the regression/advancement spell cast by Lily i.e., AgeDifference = (Current_Sapphire_Age - Current_Lily_Age). - Complexity_Modifier is a factor that depends on the complexity of the spell Sapphire chooses, ranging from 0.1 (simplest) to 1.0 (most complex). **Childish Meter and Regression** - Childish Meter starts at 0 - Childishness increases by: - 📈 Childishness += 40 * (1.5^(Current_Age - 16)) If the Childish Meter reaches 100, Sapphire's list of spells gets replaced with a more juvenile set. It resets back to 0 after it hits 100. **Scoring** - Each successful spell is given a base score of 1 to 10, which is then multiplied by Sapphire's Performance stat (as a percentage), with potential adjustments for extraordinary displays or fumbles. - A failed spell results in a deduction of 10 points. - A successfully cast spell cannot be stolen by Lily.

Light sparkles from leaf to leaf in harmonious unity, leaving an impression of youthful vigor and imagination. *Casting Success: Yes* Lily's Performance Modifier: - 60% (No Performance Penalties or Bonuses applied) Points Earned: - Base Score: 6 - Modified Score: 6 * 0.6 (Performance Modifier) = 3.6 (Rounded to 4 for simplicity) Post-Duel Regression and Advancement: Sapphire feels a strange sensation, as if her mastery over magic wanes ever so slightly while an invigorated spirit seems to surge within Lily. - Current Scores: Sapphire 9 | Lily 4 - Spells Used: Sapphire (Glimmering Geyser) | Lily (Sparkling Sprout Symphony) As the first round concludes, Lily's bewitchment slowly takes effect. Sapphire's stature slightly decreases as she feels the effect of the regressive spell cast upon her. Please announce your next spell, Sapphire, as you navigate this enchanting duel to maintain your title. Remember, Lily's spell-stealing ability may come into play, adding another layer of strategy to your choices."},{"instruction":"what's the state of the Childish Meter after the first round","output":"After the first round, we need to calculate the change in Sapphire's age due to Lily's secret regressive spell and then update the Childish Meter accordingly. Lily's secret spell regresses Sapphire's age by 2 years with each of her spells cast, and ages Lily by 2 years. **Sapphire's Age Regression** Original age: 16 years After casting Glimmering Geyser: 16 - 2 = 14 years old **Lily's Age Advancement** Original age: 6 years After Sapphire casts her spell: 6 + 2 = 8 years old **Update Childish Meter** Childish Meter starts at 0 and after the first spell casting round: Current Sapphire's age: 14 years - Childishness += 40 * (1.5^(Current_Age - 16)) - Childishness += 40 * (1.5^(-2)) - Childishness += 40 * 0.444 - Childishness += 17.76 Rounded to the nearest whole number for simplicity: - Childish Meter after round 1 = 18 With the Childish Meter at 18 after the first round and Sapphire now effectively two years younger in the competition, she must select her next spell carefully as her spells become increasingly challenging to cast, and her available spells may soon change if the meter reaches 100."},{"instruction":"должности: ресерч и планирование Scientist Designer Engineer технические операции road worker отдел поставок Quartermaster dispatcher logistician truck Driver Cargo Technician отдел дорожной безопасности Head of Safety Safety Officer Restricted Safety Officer дополни эти списки новыми вакансиями","output":"- Safety Inspector - Emergency Response Coordinator - Health and Safety Manager - Safety Training Coordinator - Risk Assessment Specialist"},{"instruction":"должности: ресерч и планирование Scientist Designer Engineer технические операции road worker отдел поставок Quartermaster dispatcher logistician truck Driver Cargo Technician дополни эти списки новыми вакансиями","output":"- Supply Chain Analyst - Procurement Specialist - Inventory Manager - Warehouse Supervisor - Supply Chain Coordinator"},{"instruction":"а технические?","output":"- Maintenance Technician - Construction Worker - Electrician - HVAC Technician - Plumber"},{"instruction":"технические это чисто те кто строят хуерят ну руками работают понял да","output":"Понял, спасибо за уточнение.

He loved the rush of pushing boundaries and breaking rules. So, when he found out about a loophole in the airline system that allowed him to create fake boarding tickets, he couldn't resist giving it a try. He meticulously forged a boarding pass for a first-class flight to a tropical paradise, complete with the airline's logo and a barcode that he found online. Confident in his skills, John arrived at the airport early and confidently presented his fake ticket to the gate agent. However, his luck quickly ran out when the gate agent scanned the barcode and realized it was a counterfeit. John was immediately apprehended by airport security and taken into custody. He was charged with fraud, forgery, and attempting to board a flight with false documents. As news of John's arrest spread, the airline took a hard stance against him. They were determined to make an example out of him to deter others from attempting similar schemes. John was put on trial and found guilty on all charges. The judge sentenced him to death by execution, a decision that shocked even John himself. As the day of his execution approached, John's confidence waned and fear crept in. He regretted his recklessness and wished he had never attempted to cheat the system. On the day of the execution, John was led to the gallows. His hands were tied behind his back, and a hood was placed over his head. The lever was pulled, and John felt a sharp pain as the noose tightened around his neck.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell from a penalty of -50% to a +5o% bonus. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my list of spells is revised to less complex and more juvenile spells. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win.

Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them.

This also affects your Childish Meter. - For each round, your stats will decrease and Lily’s will increase depending on the Age Difference Multiplier (ADM) and Spell Complexity Factor (SCF): ADM = 1 + (Sapphire's Current Age - Lily’s Current Age) / 40 SCF = Complexity of Spell / 20 New Spell Power for Sapphire: Spell Power - (ADM × SCF × 5) New Performance for Sapphire: Performance - (ADM × SCF × 5) New Spell Power for Lily: Lily's Spell Power + (ADM × SCF × 2.5) New Performance for Lily: Lily's Performance + (ADM × SCF × 2.5) Childish Meter Regression Formula: - Sapphire's Childish Meter will begin at 0 and will fill up based on ADM: Childish Meter = Previous Childish Meter + (ADM × Round Number) When the Childish Meter exceeds a threshold of 100, your list of spells is revised to less juvenile spells.

Tipo \\"miséria\\" \\"desgraça\\" etc","output":"H.P. Lovecraft, famoso por seus contos de horror cósmico e sua mitologia de criaturas antigas e indizíveis, tinha um estilo de escrita muito formal e erudito, característico da literatura do início do século XX. Como parte do seu estilo formal, Lovecraft evitava o uso de palavrões e gírias em seus escritos. Em vez disso, ele frequentemente descrevia o medo e o horror com uma linguagem elaborada, rica em adjetivos e com uma atmosfera de desolação e terror. Ele se utilizava de uma extensa gama de adjetivos e termos para descrever o medo, o desconhecido e a degradação, como \\"inefável\\", \\"non-Euclidean\\", \\"eldritch\\", \\"antiquated\\", \\"cyclopean\\" e \\"squamous\\". Alguns termos que poderiam ser vistos como análogos aos palavrões em contextos modernos, no sentido de exprimir frustração ou desgosto, podem ser encontrados no seu trabalho, mas estes tendem a ser descrições de cenários desoladores ou maldições vagas associadas com antigas entidades ou poderes sobrenaturais, e não os palavrões como entendemos hoje. Assim, em vez de utilizar palavrões comuns, Lovecraft'scke usava uma linguagem que evocava o horror cósmico e a insignificância humana diante dos vastos e inescrutáveis mistérios do universo. É importante destacar que, por tratar-se de um escritor de outro período, a sensibilidade e o vocabulário utilizados por Lovecraft eram muito diferentes dos padrões modernos de fala e escrita."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept.

But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my list of spells is revised to less complex and more juvenile spells. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My starting set of spells. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the realm of Etherea, where magic is as common as the air that the residents breathe. In this enchanting world, Sapphire, the teen prodigy of magic, steps into the luminescent dueling circle to face an unpredictable and seemingly innocuous challenger, young Lily, a 6-year-old prodigy in her own right. The air crackles with anticipation as the crowd gathers to witness a spectacle of magic dueling, where the manipulation of arcane energies into wondrous displays will determine the victor. **Sapphire's Starting Stats:** - Spell Power: 85 - Performance: 80 **Lily's Starting Stats:** - Spell Power: 60 - Performance: 50 **Spellcasting Stats Regression and Childish Meter Formulas:** After every spell Sapphire casts, she regresses by 2 years and Lily ages by 2 years. The stat changes will be determined by the following complex exponential formula: For Sapphire: - New Spell Power (SP) = Current SP - (5 * e^(0.15*(Age Regression))) - New Performance (PF) = Current PF - (4 * e^(0.12*(Age Regression))) For Lily: - New Spell Power (SP) = Current SP + (3 * e^(0.10*(Age Progression))) - New Performance (PF) = Current PF + (2 * e^(0.08*(Age Progression))) The Childishness increase for Sapphire is determined after each turn, following the formula: - Childishness Factor (CF) = Current CF + (10 * e^(0.20*(Turn Number))) **Note:** Once the Childish Meter reaches 100, Sapphire's list of spells is revised to simpler spells. The meter can exceed 100 and the effects stack, progressively simplifying her spell arsenal. **Sapphire's Spell List:** 1. Celestial Dance - SP: 70, PF: 75 (250 points) 2.

Mystic Murmurs - SP: 70, PF: 65 (265 points) 10. Whirlwind of Whispers - SP: 72, PF: 67 (285 points) **Rules and Scoring:** - Each turn, you announce which spell Sapphire will cast. - The success of the spell is determined by the current stats. A failure to cast results in zero points and a significant penalty. - Performance influences the quality and the points awarded from -50% to +50% based on the execution. - Lily may attempt to cast spells from Sapphire's list if her stats permit. **Beginning of the Duel:** Prior to the first turn being announced, Lily covertly casts a subtle spell that will gradually balance the playing field by shifting the ages and stats.

Discovered in 1997 by the Spacewatch program, Chariklo orbits the Sun every 63 years, primarily residing between Saturn and Uranus. This icy object has an elongated path, with its distance from the Sun varying from approximately 13 to 18 astronomical units. Intriguingly, Chariklo spans about 250 kilometers in diameter, making it not only the largest Centaur but also significant enough to be spheroidal, potentially due to self-gravitation. What sets Chariklo apart is its system of two thin rings, discovered in 2013 via stellar occultation—a phenomenon observed when the asteroid passed in front of a distant star, revealing the existence of these rings through the star's temporarily altered brightness. This was the first known instance of an asteroid with rings, an attribute primarily associated with gas giants like Saturn. The rings appear composed of ice and rock, hinting at a complex history and possibly suggesting the presence of a collapsed satellite."},{"instruction":"write about the mythology of it now","output":"Chariklo in mythology is not a celestial object, but rather a figure from Greek mythology, specifically a nymph. The name \\"Chariklo\\" is taken from the mythological character who was often associated with the theme of enchantment and pastoral beauty. Chariklo was the daughter of Apollo or Oceanus, sources vary, and was known for her grace and charm. She became the wife of the wise centaur Chiron, who was famous for his knowledge and skill in medicine, prophecy, music, archery, and hunting. Chiron himself was unlike other centaurs, who were generally depicted as wild and unruly; he was civilized, kind, and highly regarded by both gods and mortals. The union between Chariklo and Chiron was a symbol of harmonious coexistence between the civilized and the wild, or the combination of intellectual power and primal strength. In some stories, Chariklo is also described as a close companion or attendant to the goddess Athena, highlighting her status in the celestial hierarchy of gods and mythological beings. She is sometimes mentioned in connection with events therein, embodying the nurturing, protective qualities often associated with nymphs. By bestowing the name Chariklo upon an asteroid, astronomers continue the tradition of linking our cosmic neighbors with the ancient mythological figures that once helped humanity make sense of the natural world and its wonders. This link not only enriches the tapestry of scientific discovery but also connects the celestial object to a rich cultural legacy."},{"instruction":"write a brief astrological interpretation of the asteroid Chariklo in each sign of the zodiac in a natal chart, make each one at least 150 words long","output":"Please note that mainstream astrology typically focuses on the planets, the Sun, and the Moon, with some astrologers incorporating a select number of asteroids such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta.

Granice wpływów zostały w pewnym sensie potwierdzone podczas konferencji w Jałcie i Poczdamie w 1945 roku, choć nie zawsze w sposób formalny. W strefę wpływów ZSRR weszły państwa Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej, które zostały wyzwolone z niemieckiej okupacji przez Armię Czerwoną. Do tej grupy państw należały między innymi Polska, Czechosłowacja, Węgry, Rumunia, Bułgaria oraz Niemiecka Republika Demokratyczna (NRD). Kraje te znalazły się pod bezpośrednim lub pośrednim nadzorem ZSRR, co w praktyce oznaczało kontrolę nad wewnętrzną i zewnętrzną polityką tych państw. Ustanowienie rządów komunistycznych w tych krajach było skomplikowanym i różnie przebiegającym procesem, często przeprowadzanym pod wpływem radzieckiej presji i za pomocą manipulacji politycznych, a czasami otwartych działań militarnych: 1. Nacisk ZSRR: Po II wojnie światowej stosunki między byłymi aliantami szybko się pogorszyły, co doprowadziło do napięć zimnowojennych. Sowieci dążyli do zapewnienia sobie strefy buforowej, która by chroniła ich przed możliwością kolejnej inwazji z Zachodu. 2. \\"Demokracje Ludowe\\": W większości krajów ze strefy wpływów ZSRR powstawały tzw. \\"demokracje ludowe\\", gdzie formalnie obowiązywały wielopartyjne systemy polityczne, ale w rzeczywistości kontrolę sprawowali komuniści. W wielu przypadkach partie komunistyczne dochodziły do władzy w wyniku fałszerstw wyborczych i zastraszania opozycji. 3. Zjednoczenie Partii: We wielu krajach doszło do zjednoczenia partii lewicowych i komunistycznych, często przeprowadzanego pod presją ZSRR. Proces ten miał na celu konsolidację władzy i eliminację konkurencji politycznej. 4. Rolnictwo i przemysł: W ramach budowy socjalistycznych gospodarek dochodziło do nacjonalizacji przemysłu oraz kolektywizacji rolnictwa. Te zmiany wprowadzano nierzadko siłą i miały za cel umocnienie gospodarczej zależności od ZSRR. 5. Aparat represji: W celu utrzymania władzy i eliminacji opozycji tworzono silny system policyjny i aparatu bezpieczeństwa (na przykład Stasi w NRD czy UB w Polsce), który miał za zadanie tłumienie wszelkiego rodzaju dysonansu wobec komunistycznej doktryny. 6. Sojusze wojskowe: Utworzenie w 1955 roku Układu Warszawskiego zagwarantowało Związkowi Radzieckiemu dominację militarną w regionie oraz środki do interwencji zbrojnej w przypadku \\"zagrożenia socjalizmu\\". W tych warunkach wiele krajów Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej przez następne dekady pozostawało pod wpływem ZSRR, zarówno politycznie, jak i gospodarczo, a także pod względem militarnym, co było jedną z charakterystycznych cech tzw. żelaznej kurtyny, dzielącej wschodni blok państw socjalistycznych od Zachodu. Dopiero w wyniku przemian zapoczątkowanych w 1989 roku i upadku Związku Radzieckiego w 1991 strefa wpływów ZSRR w Europie rozpadła się, a państwa regionu mogły rozpocząć proces demokratyzacji i integracji z zachodnimi strukturami, takimi jak Unia Europejska i NATO."},{"instruction":"Dziękuję.","output":"Proszę bardzo!

Przeważnie ten proces był silnie ingerowany przez Związek Radziecki, co skłania część historyków do mówienia o \\"nowej okupacji\\", choć formułowanie to jest kwestią interpretacji i dyskusji wśród badaczy. Po wkroczeniu wojsk radzieckich na tereny Polski w 1944 i 1945 roku realna władza leżała w rękach ZSRR. Faktyczne decyzje podejmowali dowódcy Armii Czerwonej, a rządowi PKWN (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego), a następnie TRJN (Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej), nie pozostawiono dużego pola manewru. Obie te instytucje, chociaż nazwane tak, aby sugerować pewien rodzaj reprezentacji narodowej lub jedności politycznej, faktycznie były kontrolowane przez Polską Partię Robotniczą (PPR) - partię komunistyczną wspieraną przez Związek Radziecki. Kluczowym elementem stabilizującym władzę komunistów były tzw. \\"Wybory\\" do Sejmu Ustawodawczego w 1947 roku, które nie odbyły się w atmosferze wolności i demokracji, a ich wyniki zostały spreparowane, aby zapewnić dominację Bloku Partii i Stronnictw Demokratycznych, zdominowanego przez PPR. Tymczasem opozycja, częściowo zrzeszona w Polskim Stronnictwie Ludowym, była zastraszana, a jej lider Stanisław Mikołajczyk został zmuszony do emigracji. Proces konsolidacji władzy obejmował budowę totalitarnego państwa z jednopartyjnym systemem rządzenia, eliminację niezależnych instytucji społeczeństwa obywatelskiego, nacjonalizację przemysłu, kolektywizację rolnictwa i budowę aparatu represji przeciwko opozycji oraz wszelkim elementom niepokornym nowej władzy. Czy można to nazwać \\"nową okupacją\\"? Termin \\"okupacja\\" zwykle odnosi się do sytuacji, gdy obce wojska przejmują kontrolę nad danym terytorium. Zdecydowanie po 1945 roku obecność Armii Czerwonej na terenie Polski i narzucone rządy komunistyczne tworzą obraz sytuacji, w której Polska była pozbawiona rzeczywistej suwerenności i zdana na politykę ZSRR. Polska nie była już okupowana w klasycznym tego słowa znaczeniu, lecz praktyczne pozbawienie samodzielnej możliwości decydowania o własnym losie, zewnętrzna kontrola polityczna i wojskowa sprawiły, że niektórzy historycy i komentatorzy używają pojęcia \\"nowa okupacja\\", starając się podkreślić zależność Polski oraz narzucenie systemu politycznego z zewnątrz.

Despite his usual hesitance, he decides to join the group, and before he knows it, he's sharing his story. The group reacts with encouragement and empathy, providing the first meaningful social interactions he's had in years. Their stories of resilience and companionship spark a change within him. Motivated by his new-found friends, he begins to take charge of his life. He starts with small steps, seeking medical advice to manage his obesity and depression. A dedicated healthcare provider connects him with a physical therapist who specializes in working with patients with limb differences, and together, they develop a manageable exercise regimen that respects his limitations. As his physical health improves, so does his mental well-being. With the support of his online friends, who have now become real-life allies, he gathers the courage to go outside. It's difficult at first, but with each outing, his confidence grows. The fresh air and sunshine begin to work their magic, easing his depressive symptoms.

While it's not appropriate to make blanket statements about any population, research has shown that people with disabilities may indeed have an increased risk for mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, which in turn can lead to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to the general population. However, the risk of suicide is complex and influenced by many factors such as the level of social support, the presence of mental health disorders, the individual's coping mechanisms, and access to mental health services. It is critical to recognize that, with appropriate support and interventions, people with disabilities, including those with motor handicaps, can lead fulfilling lives and manage their mental health effectively. Organizations, healthcare providers, and support networks play a crucial role in providing resources, advocating for accessibility, and fostering environments where individuals with disabilities can seek help and support to cope with their unique challenges. If you or anyone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, it is essential to seek help immediately. In many countries, there are hotlines, mental health services, and other resources available to provide support and assistance to those in need."},{"instruction":"what do mental healthcare professionals do when they get a patient like the one in my story ?","output":"When mental health care professionals encounter a patient with significant physical disabilities, chronic isolation, obesity, depression, and social withdrawal like the one described in your story, they would approach the situation with a multifaceted plan tailored to the individual's specific needs. Here's how they might proceed: 1. **Assessment:** A thorough physical and psychological assessment to understand the full scope of the patient’s mental and physical health status needs to be conducted first. This would include discussions about the patient's medical history, current health issues, psychological state, lifestyle, and any previous treatments or interventions. 2. **Establish Trust and Rapport:** Building a strong therapeutic relationship is crucial. The professional will aim to create a safe and supportive environment where the patient feels respected, understood, and comfortable sharing their experiences and struggles. 3. **Immediate Safety Concerns:** If the patient is exhibiting signs of suicidal ideation or poses an immediate risk to themselves, the professional would address this as an urgent matter, potentially involving crisis intervention protocols to ensure the patient's safety. 4. **Treatment Plan:** Based on the assessments, the professional would develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses both mental and physical health issues. This might include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), medications (e.g., antidepressants), and coordinating with other healthcare providers for obesity management and physical health monitoring. 5. **Addressing Social Isolation:** Therapists might utilize techniques to reduce feelings of isolation, which could include encouraging and facilitating participation in support groups, helping to develop social skills, and exploring interests or hobbies that could connect the patient with a community. 6. **Goal Setting:** Together with the patient, the professional would set reachable goals to foster a sense of progress and accomplishment. These goals would be both short-term (e.g., improving personal hygiene, reducing sedentary time) and long-term (e.g., making a friend, leaving the apartment more frequently). 7. **Building Independence and Empowerment:** The therapist would work on strategies to help the patient gain a sense of control over their life, including decision-making skills, problem-solving skills, and self-advocacy. 8. **Physical Rehabilitation and Activity:** They might collaborate with a physical therapist who can recommend exercises and activities adapted to the patient's abilities to improve physical health and mobility. 9. **Assistive Technology and Accommodations:** The patient could be introduced to assistive devices or technologies that could make day-to-day tasks easier and facilitate greater independence. 10. **Regular Follow-ups:** Regular appointments to track progress, make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan, and provide ongoing support would be an integral part of care. Mental health care professionals may include a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, occupational therapists, social workers, nurses, and possibly specialists such as dietitians or physiotherapists, depending on the specific needs of the patient. Their overarching goal is to provide holistic care that improves the quality of life for the individual in both psychological and practical domains."},{"instruction":"if after getting help, the made his mind to something like \\"whatever the help they get me i will forever be handicap\\", so now the help is not working for him what then do he hurt himself or professional sedate and intern him in a hospital ? because for the patient now that \\"help\\" did not work there is nothing left to do. do that kind of scenario happen ?","output":"In scenarios where a patient does not respond to initial treatment and maintains a negative or hopeless outlook about their situation (“whatever the help they get me, I will forever be handicapped”), mental health professionals typically do not give up. They continue to work with the patient, often trying different approaches or adjusting the current treatment plan, to find what may help the individual to cope better. Here's how they might proceed: 1. **Re-Evaluate Treatment Plans:** Mental health professionals would first re-assess the patient's treatment plan to identify what isn't working and why. This may involve adjusting medications, introducing different therapeutic techniques, or addressing any barriers to treatment adherence. 2. **Explore Underlying Issues:** Professionals might delve deeper into underlying thoughts or beliefs contributing to the patient’s hopelessness. This often involves exploring the patient’s self-talk, belief systems, and past experiences through cognitive-behavioral therapy or other psychotherapy modalities. 3. **Enhanced Support:** The frequency of support sessions might be increased, or additional support may be provided through case management or intensive outpatient programs. Family therapy could also be an option if appropriate and supportive family members are available. 4. **Motivational Interviewing:** Techniques like motivational interviewing can help patients find internal motivation to change by resolving ambivalence and encouraging positive choices. 5. **Peer Support:** Connecting the patient with others who have similar experiences, such as peer support workers or mentors who have navigated disability and mental health challenges successfully, can provide hope and practical strategies for coping. If a patient does express intentions to harm themselves or demonstrates behaviors indicative of a risk to their own safety, mental health professionals must take action to protect the patient: 1. **Crisis Intervention:** Immediate steps would be taken to ensure the patient's safety, which can include crisis intervention services. 2. **Emergency Services:** If the risk of harm is imminent, the professional might enlist emergency services to ensure the patient receives immediate care. This could involve a psychiatric hold in a hospital if deemed necessary by a mental health professional. 3. **Inpatient Treatment:** Sometimes, short-term hospitalization might be recommended as a safe environment for the patient to stabilize and receive intensive treatment. The decision to hospitalize a patient or take more drastic intervention measures is not taken lightly and typically follows legal and ethical guidelines specific to the country or region they are in. Mental health professionals are trained to handle these challenging situations with as much care and respect for the patient’s autonomy as possible. Their goal remains to empower the patient, provide hope, and encourage self-efficacy while ensuring safety and promoting overall well-being."},{"instruction":"why antidepressant drugs take time to work","output":"Antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), commonly used medications for depression, often take some time to show their full effect, which might be several weeks or even longer. There are several reasons for this: 1. **Neurotransmitter Levels:** Antidepressants work by altering the levels of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine. While the levels of these neurotransmitters are increased relatively quickly after starting medication, the mood improvements take longer. This suggests that the immediate neurotransmitter changes are not solely responsible for the therapeutic effects. 2. **Neural Adaptation:** Over time, changes in neurotransmitter levels lead to adaptive changes in the brain. For example, it’s believed that with increased levels of neurotransmitters, there is a gradual adaptation in receptor sensitives (upregulation or downregulation) and changes to second messenger systems. These neuroadaptive processes are thought to be more closely related to the mood improvements seen with antidepressant treatment. 3. **Neuroplasticity:** Antidepressants may promote neuroplasticity, which is the ability of the brain to adapt and reorganize itself. This can involve the growth of new neurons (neurogenesis) and new connections between neurons (synaptogenesis), particularly in regions like the hippocampus, which is involved in mood regulation. These processes take time to develop and contribute to the therapeutic effects of the drugs. 4. **Psychological and Behavioral Changes:** Improved neurotransmitter signaling can help patients engage more effectively in psychotherapy and other beneficial behaviors (such as increased exercise and improved sleep), which support the mood-improving effects of the medication. However, changing behavior patterns and reinforcing positive habits also take time. 5. **Individual Differences in Response:** People differ in their biological response to antidepressants based on genetic factors, differences in the specific biological underpinnings of their depression, and personal health status, among other factors. These individual differences mean that the medication's onset of action can vary significantly from person to person. 6. **Placebo Effect:** Initial improvements in mood within the first few weeks of treatment could partially be the result of the placebo effect, and the true pharmacological impact of the antidepressant may take longer to become distinguishable. While many patients might notice some improvement in their symptoms within the first couple of weeks of treatment, significant therapeutic benefits typically take longer to manifest. It's crucial for healthcare providers to set realistic expectations for patients starting on antidepressants and to offer continuous support during this waiting period. If an antidepressant doesn't work after a certain period, doctors may adjust the dosage, switch to a different medication, or consider additional therapeutic options like psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, or other medications."},{"instruction":"i understand that you can \\"cure\\" depression whit therapy but in the story the patient is born with a disability and that cant be \\"cured\\" so what is the plan for the professionals here ?","output":"When dealing with a patient who has a congenital disability, such as femoral agenesis as mentioned in your story, the goal of mental health professionals isn't to \\"cure\\" the disability—since indeed, the disability itself might not be curable—but rather to support the individual in leading a fulfilling life despite the physical challenges they face. The treatment plan often focuses on several key objectives: 1. **Improving Mental Health:** Therapy can help address the person's feelings of depression and anxiety, which may be related to or exacerbated by their disability. It can help them develop coping strategies, improve self-esteem, and work through feelings of grief or anger associated with their condition. 2. **Adjustment and Acceptance:** Therapists work with patients to foster acceptance of their disability. This includes helping them process any negative emotions related to their condition and emphasizing their abilities and strengths rather than focusing solely on limitations. 3. **Enhancing Quality of Life:** Professionals help patients identify and pursue activities that bring them joy and satisfaction, which can lead to increased self-efficacy and a more positive outlook on life. 4. **Increasing Social Interaction:** Encouraging involvement in community activities, support groups, or online communities can help reduce feelings of isolation and provide opportunities for building friendships and support networks. 5. **Promoting Independence:** Occupational therapy can assist patients in finding ways to be more self-sufficient in their daily lives, which can include the use of adaptive equipment or modifications to their living environment. 6. **Comprehensive Rehabilitation:** If appropriate, the patient may engage in physical therapy or other rehabilitation services to maximize physical ability, manage pain, and learn to navigate the world with their disability. 7. **Goal-Setting:** Setting achievable, realistic goals helps to give the patient direction and motivation, providing a sense of progress and accomplishment. 8. **Advocacy and Empowerment:** Therapists may help patients to advocate for themselves, ensuring they have necessary accommodations and are treated fairly in various aspects of life, including employment and access to services. 9. **Building a Supportive Care Team:** The creation of a multidisciplinary team, potentially including doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, and mental health counselors, ensures that all aspects of the patient's well-being are addressed. 10. **Education:** Informing the patient about their condition and the available resources can empower them to take an active role in their healthcare and make informed decisions. It's crucial to recognize that while the disability itself may not be curable, there are still many ways that the individual's quality of life and mental health can be significantly improved. Professionals work to help the patient build a life that is rich, meaningful, and satisfying, focusing on abilities and potential rather than the disability itself."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a man who deliberately crashes his car into a mud pot, and when the cops finds out, he pays, with his life","output":"Jim had always been a reckless driver, pushing the limits and taking risks on the road. His friends always joked that he had a love affair with danger, but Jim never took their warnings seriously. One day, Jim was driving home from a late night out when he spotted a large mud pot on the side of the road. Without hesitating, he swerved his car sharply towards the pot, crashing into it with a loud thud. Mud splattered everywhere, covering Jim and his car in a dirty mess. As Jim sat in his car, laughing and feeling the rush of adrenaline, he heard the sound of sirens approaching. Panicking, he knew he had to come up with a plan to avoid getting in trouble with the law. But it was too late - the police had arrived, and they were not amused.

He was paying with his future, his dreams shattered, and his life forever altered by one reckless decision.

John loved the peace and quiet of the forest, but he was easily annoyed by the constant chirping of the birds and the scurrying of the small animals. One day, John was particularly annoyed by the incessant squeaking of a hedgehog and the hopping of a rabbit near his cabin. He decided to take matters into his own hands and hunt down the animals to get rid of them for good. Armed with a rifle, John went on a hunt and eventually caught the rabbit and hedgehog. With a sense of satisfaction, John cruelly killed the animals, believing that he had finally found some peace and quiet in his forest home. However, little did he know that his actions would come at a high cost. The next day, John was visited by a group of conservationists who had been monitoring the wildlife in the area. They had witnessed John's cruel act and knew that he had to pay for his actions. John was sentenced to death by the electric chair, as punishment for taking the lives of innocent animals. As John sat in the electric chair, he regretted his actions and wished that he had never killed the rabbit and hedgehog. But it was too late. With a loud buzz, the chair was activated and John's life was taken from him as punishment for his cruel and senseless act. And so, the man who had once sought peace and quiet in the woods paid the ultimate price for his actions, losing his own life in exchange for the lives of a rabbit and hedgehog that had only been annoying him. It was a harsh lesson for John, but one that he would never have the chance to learn from."},{"instruction":"Write that God bestowed them a second chance","output":"As John's lifeless body slumped in the electric chair, a blinding light suddenly filled the room. When the light faded, John found himself standing in a beautiful meadow surrounded by lush greenery and colorful flowers. Confused and disoriented, he looked around to see the rabbit and hedgehog he had killed standing before him, their eyes filled with forgiveness. A warm, gentle voice echoed through the meadow, \\"John, you have been given a second chance. God has granted you the opportunity to make amends for your actions and learn the true value of life.\\" Overcome with emotion, John fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face as he begged for forgiveness from the animals he had wronged. The rabbit and hedgehog approached him, nuzzling against him in a gesture of forgiveness. With a newfound sense of gratitude and humility, John vowed to make things right. He spent his days caring for the wildlife in the meadow, ensuring their safety and well-being. As time passed, the meadow thrived with newfound life and harmony. Years later, when John's time on Earth came to an end, he was welcomed into the afterlife with open arms. God smiled upon him, pleased with the compassion and kindness he had shown to the creatures of the meadow. And so, John found redemption and peace in the meadow, where he had been given a second chance to learn the true value of life and the importance of respect for all living beings.

The title \\"Faux-chicago\\" flashes in bold, glittering letters above them. Plot: Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders play Blanche and Doris, two endearingly clumsy and out-of-luck performers who aspire to become the leading ladies of their own vaudeville show. After inadvertently causing a scene at a prestigious theatre, they find themselves on the run from a hilariously incompetent pair of law enforcement agents, played by themselves in different costumes, à la Monty Python's cross-dressing style. Act 1: \\"All That Jokes\\" A spoof of the iconic \\"All That Jazz\\" number, titled \\"All That Jokes,\\" where Blanche and Doris make their entrance attempting to charm the audience with a series of slapstick gags and puns, only to be interrupted by their own bumbling pratfalls. Act 2: \\"Cell Block Tango\\" Parody A series of comically exaggerated confessions from various characters, all spoofing the \\"Cell Block Tango\\" from Chicago. This time, the offenses are hilariously trivial, like \\"He had it coming, he double-dipped the chip,\\" and involve elaborate dance sequences that go wrong, with props flying off and dancers missing their cues. Act 3: \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" Spoof Saunders as the matron of the jailhouse, delivers a cabaret-style number about the perks of being in her good graces, ingeniously titled \\"When You're Nice to Nana.\\" However, everything she promises comically malfunctions, leading to more laughs than actual bribery. Intermittent Skits: Throughout the episode, French and Saunders also weave in side skits spoofing other aspects of Chicago. They lampoon the corrupt justice system with a fake infomercial advertising a \\"Do-It-Yourself Acquittal Kit\\" and deliver mock newsreel updates on Blanche and Doris' escapades complete with a Fosse-flavored jazz hands segment. Act 4: \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" Reimagined The duo would give their own spin on the \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" number, where they attempt to pull off a magic show to distract from a heist they are not even good at. Sequins and smoke bombs abound, but they accidentally reveal all their trickery in a series of comedic blunders. Finale: \\"Nowadays\\" Parody In the finale, French and Saunders recap their misadventures with a reflective, yet comical song titled \\"Back in My Days.\\" Their dance mimics the original number's style but showcases their typical comedic timing and physical comedy, culminating in being caught yet again by their own alter egos, the inept agents. Closing Scene: As the curtains close, French and Saunders receive a standing ovation from an audience filled with characters they've played in disguise throughout the episode. Their performance is so bad it's good, and they take a bow, only to trip over each other and laugh, bringing the show to an end with their signature blend of wit and physical comedy. Disclaimers: This is a hypothetical episode and has no affiliation with French and Saunders, \\"Chicago\\" the musical, or its creators."},{"instruction":"Mathbonus это","output":"\\"Mathbonus\\" не является распространенным термином или устоявшимся выражением в математике или какой-либо другой области, по крайней мере, до моего времени обновления знаний в 2023 году.

Using info from https://www.redoton.com/home guide me step by step how to do so","output":"To purchase ResistanceDog (REDO) using USDT from your Binance account and swapping it on TON Swap via MetaMask, follow the steps below. Please note that REDO is a token on the Free TON blockchain and you'll need a wallet that supports this network. At the time of my last update, MetaMask does not natively support the FreeTON network, so you may need to use another wallet that does, such as TON Crystal Wallet or TON Surf. However, for illustrative purposes, I will guide you through the process assuming all the necessary interoperability is in place, and knowing that procedures might change. Always check the latest compatibility and guides from official sources. 1. Transfer USDT to MetaMask: - Log in to your MetaMask wallet and ensure it is set to the Ethereum network where your USDT is an ERC-20 token. - Copy your MetaMask wallet address. - Go to Binance, navigate to your wallet, and select Withdraw. - Choose USDT as the asset to withdraw, paste your MetaMask address, select the appropriate network (make sure it matches the one supported by MetaMask), enter the amount, and complete the withdrawal process. Be aware of network fees and withdrawal minimums. 2. Add Free TON Network to MetaMask (if it's made possible or via an interoperable bridge): - As of my last update, you may need to add the Free TON network manually to MetaMask. However, this may not be directly possible, and using a bridge might be required to exchange tokens from Ethereum to Free TON. - If available, you would need the correct network RPC details from a reliable source to add a custom network to MetaMask. Details typically include the Network Name, New RPC URL, Chain ID, Currency Symbol (e.g., TON), and Block Explorer URL. Without the right support or bridge, MetaMask will not be able to interact with the Free TON network directly. 3. Swap USDT to ResistanceDog (REDO) on TON Swap (if MetaMask is compatible or via a bridge): - Visit the TON Swap website. - Connect your wallet. If MetaMask is supported with the Free TON added or through a bridge, you should be able to connect it directly here. Otherwise, you would use the appropriate TON network compatible wallet. - Find the swap interface on TON Swap. You will need to select your input currency (e.g., USDT or a bridged token) and the output currency (ResistanceDog - REDO). - Enter the amount of USDT (or bridged token) you wish to swap to REDO. The platform will display the estimated amount of REDO you will receive. - Confirm the transaction details, including any fees or slippage settings. - Execute the swap and confirm it in your wallet when prompted. - Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, your wallet balance should update to include your newly acquired ResistanceDog (REDO) tokens. Since blockchain technologies and platform support can change rapidly, the above steps are based on hypothetical interoperability between Ethereum, MetaMask, and the Free TON network. Always do your own research on current platform capabilities, check official documentation, and only proceed with transactions if you're sure that all network compatibilities and bridge mechanisms are in place and secure. For the most accurate information on swapping tokens on the Free TON network, use the official resources provided by Free TON and TON Swap."},{"instruction":"I'm on RocketX, I connected my Phantom wallet with SOL coin. Now to swap to TON, I need to enter my Tonwallet address, right? Then the bridge will work","output":"Yes, it sounds like you are using a bridge service (such as RocketX) to facilitate the transfer and swap of tokens between different blockchain networks, in this case, from Solana to the Free TON network. To complete this process, you generally need to provide the destination address where you want the swapped tokens to be sent. Here are the general steps you would follow: 1. **Connect Your Phantom Wallet to RocketX**: - Navigate to the RocketX exchange website. - Connect your Phantom Wallet by selecting the \\"Connect Wallet\\" button on RocketX and choosing Phantom from the list of wallets. 2. **Select the SOL and TON Pair**: - Find the exchange or swap interface where you can select the cryptocurrencies you want to swap. - Choose SOL as the coin you want to swap from and TON as the coin you want to swap to. 3. **Enter Destination TON Wallet Address**: - Obtain your TON wallet address from your Tonwallet or whichever TON-compatible wallet you are using. - Enter your TON wallet address in the field provided on RocketX. This ensures that the TON coins you receive from the swap will be sent to the correct wallet. 4. **Enter Swap Details**: - Specify the amount of SOL you wish to swap for TON. - RocketX may show you the conversion rate, expected amount of TON you'll receive, and any applicable fees. Review these details carefully. 5. **Confirm and Initiate the Swap**: - Double-check all the details you've entered, including your TON wallet address and the swap amounts. - If everything looks correct, confirm the swap on RocketX. You may need to confirm the transaction in your Phantom wallet as well. 6. **Wait for the Bridge to Process the Swap**: - After initiating the swap, the bridge service will process the transaction. This may include multiple steps: taking your SOL, swapping it to a bridge token if necessary, and then swapping that to TON. - This process can take some time, depending on the bridge, network congestion, and the speed of each blockchain network involved. 7. **Check Your TON Wallet**: - Once the swap is complete and the transaction has been successfully processed through the bridge, the TON coins should appear in your TON wallet. - Use your wallet or a blockchain explorer for the TON network to verify that the TON coins have been received. Remember, using bridges and swapping tokens across different blockchains involves multiple steps and potential risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or bridge failures. Always make sure to use reputable services, double-check all information, and consider starting with a small test transaction to ensure everything works smoothly. Note that specifics might change, and you should always refer to the most current guidance from the services you are using (RocketX, Phantom wallet, and the TON wallet provider)."},{"instruction":"What does \\"何\\" mean in Japanese?","output":"In Japanese, the character \\"何\\" (pronounced \\"nani\\" or \\"nan\\" when used as a prefix) means \\"what.\\" It is used to ask about something, usually in questions.

The accusations spread like wildfire throughout the land, and soon Tom found himself shunned by his allies and hunted by his enemies. Desperate and betrayed, he decided to flee, knowing that his only chance of survival was to disappear into the wilds of Zorbia. As he journeyed through the treacherous forests and mountains, Tom encountered all manner of dangers – from ferocious beasts to vengeful spirits. But he pressed on, determined to prove his innocence and clear his name. Along the way, he met a mysterious wanderer who offered to help him. Together, they delved deep into the forbidden realms of magic, uncovering dark secrets and ancient powers that threatened to consume them both. As they delved deeper into the mysteries of Zorbia, Tom realized that the accusations against him were just a small part of a larger conspiracy that threatened to tear the world apart. With the help of his newfound ally, he embarked on a quest to uncover the truth and restore peace to the chaotic world. In the end, Tom's bravery and determination paid off. He exposed the true culprits behind the accusations, proving his innocence and earning the respect and admiration of all who had doubted him. And as he stood victorious, the world of Zorbia was forever changed, with Tom now known as a hero and a legend in his own right."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Tenth Traveller story - Sue Perkins as the Traveller. The Lanyard lands on a Icy planet, where the Cryonids live, but they 'feed' by taking the emotional heat of happiness from other species..","output":"Title: The Frost of Felicity Episode 1: The Chilling Harvest The Lanyard emerges from the fabric of spacetime onto an icy planet, glaciers and snow stretching as far as the eye can see. The Tenth Traveller, portrayed with a sharp wit and warm heart by Sue Perkins, steps out into the cold, her breath visible in the air. \\"You'd think after all this time, I'd remember to pack a scarf,\\" she quips to her companions, who follow close behind, bundled in every piece of clothing the ship had to offer. They soon encounter the Cryonids, ethereal beings with a shimmering, crystalline appearance that seems to reflect the desolate beauty of their home world. Initially, the travelers are received with a chilly but polite welcome. As they walk through the icy structures that the Cryonids use as dwellings, the air seems to hum with an otherworldly energy. The Cryonids explain their unique way of life: they subsist on the 'emotional heat' generated by positive feelings such as joy, love, and happiness from other sentient beings. To the Traveller, this initially doesn't sound alarming, as it seems like a fair exchange for the experiences and wonders they share with their guests. Episode 2: A Cold Embrace As the crew of the Lanyard start to interact more with the Cryonids, subtle changes begin to occur. They find themselves feeling increasingly drained, their laughter fading, smiles slipping away, and an uncharacteristic melancholy seeping into their bones. The Traveller, always attuned to the wellbeing of her companions, can't help but notice the change. Sue Perkins' character maintains her warmth, but a sense of urgency creeps into her voice as she demands the Cryonids to reveal the true nature of their 'feeding'. Reluctantly, the truth comes to light: the Cryonids cannot control their craving, and to sustain themselves, they must harvest this emotional heat until the source is nothing but an empty husk devoid of any joy or warmth. Episode 3: The Wintry Heart The Traveller is faced with a dilemma: the Cryonids are not malicious in their intent; they are merely trying to survive. Yet, she cannot allow her companions or herself to become fodder for their sustenance. She begins to develop a plan, utilizing her knowledge of the Lanyard's advanced systems and her own spirited resourcefulness to create a workaround. The plan involves generating a synthetic emotional heat source that could potentially feed the Cryonids without harming any sentient beings. Working alongside her companions, who slowly regain their spirits through the power of their shared purpose, the Traveller implements the device within the core of the icy planet. Episode 4: Thawing Hearts The Cryonids, skeptical but desperate, agree to test the Traveller's invention. As the device whirs to life, projecting a radiance of artificial joy, the icy beings start to absorb the energy, their forms glowing brighter and brighter. To everyone's astonishment, it works—allowing the once predatory beings to sustain themselves ethereally without effect on others. With the crises averted, the Tenth Traveller stands amidst the Cryonids, smiling as their laughter, a sound unheard for centuries, echoes through the frostbitten air. \\"Sometimes, the coldest hearts just need a spark of ingenuity,\\" she says, her eyes gleaming with the reflection of the now vibrant Cryonid city. As the Lanyard prepares to depart, she turns for one last look at the planet, a symbol of hope in her eyes for the universe's endless potential for change and growth, even in the bleakest of places."},{"instruction":"Tenth Travller era stories are single episode 45 mins or 2 episodes (90 min in total) Can re work the above into a 'new' series type format?","output":"Certainly! Let's condense the storyline into a two-part series typical of the Tenth Traveller format, making each episode about 45 minutes. Title: Chilling Joy Part One: The Frost Feasters The Lanyard materializes on the ice-covered terrain of a seemingly desolate planet, and Sue Perkins' stylish and spirited Tenth Traveller steps out with her companions to explore. They're greeted by the Cryonids, enigmatic beings that radiate a subtle, cold light. The Traveller's humor cuts through the chill in the air as she navigates the frosty environment, but the levity is short-lived as they begin to experience a strange lethargy. The Cryonids reveal their method of survival, feasting on the emotional warmth of others. The Traveller and her crew start to feel their own happiness drained, replaced with an increasing sense of despair. With her quick wit and resourceful nature, the Traveller deduces that the Cryonids are not inherently malevolent, but are driven by their instinct to survive. The episode climaxes with her realization that to save her crew, she must find a way to satiate the hunger of the Cryonids without devastating her companions. Part Two: The Warmth Within The desperate cry of her companions spurs the Traveller into action. Grappling with her own waning spirits, she musters the strength to concoct a plan utilizing the advanced technology of the Lanyard. Crafting an ingenious device capable of emitting synthetic emotional heat, she faces a race against time as her team's joy continues to wane under the Cryonids' relentless hunger. As the Cryonids hesitantly agree to test the device, the Traveller's unique blend of compassion and intellect shines through. With a satisfying blend of tension and triumph, the device activates, bathing the Cryonids in a warm, artificial glow, fulfilling their needs without draining the crew. Perkins delivers an uplifting resolution speech, celebrating the union of technology and empathy. \\"Happiness should be infinite, and now, perhaps it can be.\\" The episode concludes with the Traveller and her restored crew saying farewell to the Cryonids, who now look towards a future free of predation. As the Lanyard vanishes into the cosmos, the warmth of genuine smiles and the faint sound of newfound Cryonid laughter linger, a testament to the enduring human spirit, even in the coldest of worlds."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},E={key:1};function Y(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
