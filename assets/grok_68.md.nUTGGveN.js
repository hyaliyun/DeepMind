Question: Who has said that the change in law would violate the sanctity of marriage? Movie title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners.

CAIRO — The Egyptian government on Thursday broadened its crackdown on a 10-day uprising that has shaken its rule, arresting journalists and human rights advocates across an edgy city, while offering more concessions in a bid to win support from a population growing frustrated with a devastated economy and scenes of chaos in the streets.      The campaign was a startling blend of the oldest tactics of an authoritarian government — stoking fears of foreigners — with the air of sincerity of a repentant order. Trying to seize the initiative from a revolt that has marked one of the most decisive moments in modern Egyptian history, the government promised that neither President Hosni Mubarak nor his son Gamal, long seen as a contender for power, would run for president and offered dialogue with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, gestures almost unthinkable weeks ago.      As protesters battled crowds rallied by the government for a second day, organizers sought to rally even bigger demonstrations for Friday — dubbed the “Friday of departure” — in hopes of keeping the momentum behind a popular uprising that has demanded that Mr. Mubarak step down after three decades in power.      Voiced often in the tumultuous scenes of defiance and determination in Tahrir Square was a fear that if they lost, the protesters and their organizers would bear the brunt of a withering crackdown.      “If we can’t bring this to an end, we’re going to all be in the slammer by June,” said Murad Mohsen, a doctor treating the wounded at a makeshift clinic near barricades, where thousands fought off droves of government supporters with rocks and firebombs.      Dr. Mohsen’s comments illustrated the changing dynamic of an uprising that has captivated the Arab world, reverberating through Jordan, Sudan and Yemen, where there were peaceful protests on Thursday. New calls for protests went out in Algeria, Bahrain and Libya.      From festive scenes of just days ago, the revolt has become more martial, as exhausted men defend what they describe as the perimeter of a free Egypt around Tahrir Square. Their demands have grown more forceful and the uprising more radical. After pitched clashes of two days that left at least seven dead and hundreds wounded, banners in Tahrir Square declared Mr. Mubarak “a war criminal,” and several in the crowd said that the president should be executed. Major television networks were largely unable to broadcast from the square on Thursday.      The United States joined a chorus of criticism, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton saying, “We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners and diplomats.”      The government’s strategy seems motivated at turning broader opinion in the country against the protests and perhaps wearing down the demonstrators themselves, some of whom seemed exhausted by the clashes. Vice President Omar Suleiman, appointed Saturday to a position that Mr. Mubarak had until then refused to fill, appealed to Egypt’s sense of decency in allowing Mr. Mubarak to serve out his term, and he chronicled the mounting losses that, he said, the uprising had inflicted on a crippled Egyptian economy.      “End your sit-in,” he said. “Your demands have been answered.”      Mr. Mubarak said in an interview with ABC that he was eager to step down but if he did, “Egypt would sink into chaos.”      In interviews and statements, the government has increasingly spread an image that foreigners were inciting the uprising, a refrain echoed in the streets. The suggestions are part of a days-long Egyptian media campaign that has portrayed the protesters as troublemakers and ignored the scope of an uprising with diffuse goals and leadership.      “Millions turn out to support Mubarak,” read the banner headline on Thursday on the front page of Al Ahram, the leading government newspaper.      The propaganda has been so pronounced that an announcer on Nile Television, Shahira Amin, quit. “I cleared my conscience and walked out,” she said.      The Committee to Protect Journalists said it had 100 reports of attacks on journalists. Al Jazeera, the influential Arabic channel, said government supporters stormed the Hilton Hotel in Cairo, searching for journalists, and two of its reporters were attacked. A Greek journalist was stabbed with a screwdriver and others were beaten and harassed.      Police also raided the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, a headquarters for many of the international human rights organizations working in Egypt. The human rights workers were told to lie on the floor and the chips were removed from the telephones, someone present in the building said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.      As the day wore on, tension descended across parts of the city, which is still guarded by popular committees that banded together after the police withdrew Saturday. Government supporters roamed parts of the downtown, itching for a fight, and looters set fire to a shopping mall along the Nile that was already looted and burned Friday. ||||| Follow live blogging on \\"This Just In\\" and the latest tweets from CNN correspondents from the protests. Send your video, images to CNN iReport.      Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn Thursday as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square, where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis.      CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square, largely held by anti-regime demonstrators, through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum. Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday.      The source of the gunfire was not immediately known.      Voices were heard chanting a prayer after a day of violent street battles in central Cairo.      Sustained automatic weapons fire, including from what sounded like a heavy machine gun, echoed around the square, the epicenter of nine days of protests calling for Mubarak's ouster.      Anti-government demonstrators hunkered down behind makeshift barricades in the square and outside the nearby national museum against the onslaught, which demonstrators said included plainclothes police officers.      \\"They're coming in with weapons. They're spreading violence,\\" human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on Wednesday. \\"We've had peaceful protests here since Friday and no violence here. Only today were we faced with this really violent reaction.\\"      The pro-government protesters were not impeded by the army when they entered the square, CNN's Ben Wedeman said early Thursday. Anti-regime protesters are now unhappy with troops, whose commanders had promised Monday not to use force against peaceful demonstrations, for standing by, he said.      Small fires burned in the square early Thursday, some spreading to trees and walls.      Egypt's health ministry reported four people were killed and 829 were wounded in Wednesday's clashes, according to the state television network. Reported fatalities in the previous eight days of demonstrations ranged as high as 300, but CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll.      In one surreal moment, whip-wielding Mubarak supporters thundered through the crowd astride horses and camels, and at least one man was pulled off his mount and beaten. A Mubarak supporter who spoke to CNN said the riders were pyramid workers who were protesting the negative economic impact of the crisis.      \\"What you are seeing is the demonstration of the real Egyptian people who are trying to take back their country, trying to take back their street,\\" said businessman Khaled Ahmed, who described himself as \\"pro-Egyptian.\\"      But some observers said the pro-Mubarak push Wednesday was likely orchestrated by a regime bent on breaking up peaceful demonstrations.      \\"These are tactics that are well-known in Egypt,\\" Michele Dunne, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN's John King.      Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said the \\"rent-a-thugs\\" were likely sanctioned and paid by the government. This is meant to create an image of chaos so the government can move in to restore order, he said.      \\"Mubarak has -- now, certainly, with the violence today, but even before that -- lost the confidence of the overwhelming number of the Egyptian people,\\" Kagan said.      As night fell, the sound of gunfire reverberated in Tahrir Square, the name of which means \\"liberation\\" in Arabic. People hurled verbal insults, Molotov cocktails, rocks and anything else they could find -- shards of metal, sticks, shoes -- at one another.      Desperate for more ammunition, they dismantled sidewalks and picked up chunks of cement to throw. They beat each other in what rapidly spiraled into utter mayhem.      Hundreds of injured people were treated by doctors and medical staff, who turned to volunteers for assistance.      CNN iReporter Hunter Moore, 26, helped treat the wounded. The U.S. schoolteacher said Tuesday's crowds at Tahrir Square were mostly peaceful. \\"It went downhill really, really quickly\\" on Wednesday, he told CNN.      It was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere. Other Cairo neighborhoods were calm, and rallies in Egypt's second-largest city, Alexandria, were largely peaceful.      Mubarak's opponents had stood shoulder to shoulder in Tahrir Square to call for his immediate resignation in a massive rally on Tuesday. The 82-year-old president's announcement that night that he would spend the remaining seven months of his current term working to ensure a \\"peaceful transition of power\\" failed to satisfy them, and they vowed to keep up the pressure on him to resign.      The crisis has paralyzed the Egyptian economy, as the government has closed banks, idled trains and shuttered schools. Markets are running short of basic food staples, and the situation is hurting the ability of ordinary citizens to join the demonstrations, opposition activist Ziad Aly told CNN.      \\"We can't get enough bread. We can't get enough food supplies,\\" he said.      Vice President Omar Suleiman reiterated the government stance that the people have been heard, that they should go home and that they should stop demonstrating. Protesters should respect the curfew and \\"enable people to return to their jobs and their daily lives, and to allow schools and universities to reopen,\\" he said in a statement.      The state-run television network, Nile TV, sought to portray the unrest as a \\"foreign conspiracy\\" fueled by international journalists, several of whom -- including CNN's Anderson Cooper -- were attacked during Wednesday's clashes.      Despite reports that shots had been fired, Nile TV's reporters denied any shooting had taken place or even that violence had broken out in Tahrir Square. The network also said that members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood were heading to the square \\"to throw balls of fire and to start acts of riots and violence.\\"      When asked if that were true, Mohamed Morsy, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said the action came from all segments of the Egyptian people, \\"not the Muslim Brotherhood only.\\"      Morsy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the time for change is now, not when Mubarak's term ends.      \\"We need a new era, a new regime,\\" Morsy said. \\"We have a constitution.\\"      Asked whether Suleiman could lead the government until new elections, Morsy said the head of the country's supreme court should fulfill that role.      In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said an end to violence was \\"imperative.\\"      \\"It is our hope that what we saw today, we won't see tomorrow or Friday or into the weekend,\\" he said.      But Mubarak's government bluntly told outsiders to mind their own business.      \\"Our interactions within our country are Egyptian affairs and nothing more than that,\\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said. Egypt \\"will continue to be a beacon of moderation and stability in our region,\\" he said, but its people must settle their differences without \\"intervention from the outside.\\"      Though Mubarak's concessions were large and remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades, it was too little, too late for many Egyptians.      \\"He is unfortunately going to continue the agony for another six or seven months,\\" opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei said Tuesday night.      However, Mubarak supporter Waleed Tawfik told CNN that not all Egyptians agree that Mubarak should step down immediately.      \\"Change will not happen overnight. There's not a magical button for change. Change will take time,\\" he said.      The Egyptian army can't sit on the sidelines too much longer, or it could risk unraveling, said a foreign policy expert.      The army needs to pick a course of action by Friday, when more mass protests are expected after prayers, Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN's \\"Parker Spitzer.\\"      The Egyptian crisis is among the aftershocks of the revolt in Tunisia that forced that nation's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January. In Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh -- who has been in office for 32 years -- said Wednesday he will not run for president nor hand over power to his son once his current term ends in 2013.

Plants have genes. Animals have genes. You have genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity  . Heredity means all the characteristics you inherit from your parents. You get your genes from your parents. You inherit half of your genes from your mother. You inherit half of your genes from your father. Genes are a kind of code. A tree's genes tell what shape its leaves will be. A cat's genes tell what color1 its fur will be. Your genes tell what color1 your eyes will be. Your genes tell what color1 your hair will be. Everything about you comes from the code in your genes. Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells. Everything alive is made up of cells. Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells.   An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits  , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes.   In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes. Today, scientists are looking for ways to cure genetic diseases by  _ genes through a process called gene therapy. Question: If one's father has blue eyes, while his mother has grey ones,   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"It is probably their son will have either blue eyes or grey ones.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"It is probably their son will have either blue eyes or grey ones.\\" is a reasonable conclusion based on the information provided in the article. Eye color is determined by multiple genes inherited from both parents. Since the father has blue eyes and the mother has grey ones, it is likely that the child would inherit a combination of the genes responsible for determining eye color from both parents, which could result in either blue, grey, or a mixture of both eye colors in the child. As mentioned in the article, genetics are based on heredity, which means that each person inherits half of their genes from their mother and half from their father. Eye color is a polygenic trait, meaning that it is controlled by more than one gene. The specific combination of genes inherited from both the mother and father will determine the child's eye color. Although it is probable that the child will have either blue or grey eyes, it should be noted that genetics can be complex, and other eye colors could also be possible depending on the other genes inherited from their ancestors. It is important to remember that while genetics plays a significant role in determining a person's characteristics, there are many factors involved, and sometimes, the results may not be as straightforward as one might expect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The water will start to lose its heat to the cold air in the fridge. After a while, the water will be cool! 2. You could also add some ice cubes to it. Ice cubes are super cold, and when you add them to the hot water, they start to melt. As they melt, they take some of the heat away, which makes the water colder.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: There are many tables that have information on the average bond energies for a specific bond. These tables can be found online or in a chemistry book. It is important to note that these bond energies are always for molecules in a gaseous state.  For our example, you need to find the bond energy for an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond. H-H = 436 kJ/mol; Br-Br = 193 kJ/mol; H-Br = 366 kJ/mol.  To calculate bond energy for molecules in a liquid state, you need to also look up the enthalpy change of vaporization for the liquid molecule. This is the amount of energy needed to convert the liquid into a gas. This number is added to the total bond energy. For example: If you were given liquid water, you would need to add the enthalpy change of vaporization of water (+41 kJ) to the equation. In some equations, you may have the same bond broken multiple times. For example, if 4 atoms of hydrogen are in the molecule, then the bond energy of hydrogen must be counted 4 times, or multiplied by 4.  In our example, there is only 1 bond of each molecule, so the bond energies are simply multiplied by 1. H-H = 436 x 1 = 436 kJ/mol Br-Br = 193 x 1 = 193 kJ/mol Once you have multiplied the bond energies by the number of the individual bonds, you need to then sum all of the bonds on the reactant side. For our example, the sum of the bonds broken is H-H + Br-Br = 436 + 193 = 629 kJ/mol. Just as you did for the bonds broken on the reactant side, you will multiply the number of bonds formed by its respective bond energy. If you have 4 hydrogen bonds formed, you would need to multiply that bond energy by 4. For our example we have 2 H-Br bonds formed, so the bond energy of H-Br (366 kJ/mol) will be multiplied by 2: 366 x 2 = 732 kJ/mol. Again, like you did with the bonds broken, you will add up all of the bonds formed on the product side. Sometimes you will only have 1 product formed and can skip this step. In our example, there is only 1 product formed, so the energy of the bonds formed is simply the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds or 732 kJ/mol. Once you have summed all of the bond energies for both sides, simply subtract the formed bonds from the broken bonds. Remember the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). Plug in the calculated values and subtract. For our example: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed) = 629 kJ/mol - 732 kJ/mol = -103 kJ/mol. The final step to calculating bond energy is to determine whether the reaction releases energy or consumes energy. An endothermic (one that consumes energy) will have a final bond energy that is positive, while an exothermic reaction (one that releases energy) will have a negative bond energy. In our example, the final bond energy is negative, therefore, the reaction is exothermic.","output":"This article explains the process of calculating bond energies in a detailed manner. Bond energy tables, which contain average bond energies for specific bonds, can be found online or in chemistry books. It's important to note that bond energies refer to molecules in a gaseous state. For illustration, the article provides bond energies for H-H, Br-Br, and H-Br bonds. To determine bond energies in a liquid state, the enthalpy change of vaporization must be considered, which is the energy required to convert the liquid to a gas. Given an example of liquid water, the enthalpy change of vaporization should be added to the equation. When a bond is present multiple times within a molecule, its bond energy must be multiplied by the total occurrences of the bond. Using the example, the H-H and Br-Br bonds are present only once each, so their bond energies are simply multiplied by one. Next, the bond energies on the reactant side are summed, and the number of bonds formed is multiplied by their respective bond energies. The bonds formed on the product side are then added up. In the example provided, only one product is formed, so the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds is considered. Subtracting the energy of the formed bonds from the energy of the broken bonds results in the final bond energy, calculated using the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). In the given example, the reaction results in a negative bond energy, indicating that it is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases energy. An endothermic reaction, on the other hand, consumes energy and would have a positive bond energy."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: Everybody learns about germs in school, but if you want an expert talk to a what?

Q:Information:  - A mountain bike or mountain bicycle (abbreviated Mtn Bike, MTB; or ATB, for all-terrain bicycle) is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction.  - Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline. Unlike the other alpine skiing events, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined, which emphasize turning and technique, downhill is more about speed. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed.  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.  - George David Atherton , known as Gee Atherton ( born 26 February 1985 , near Salisbury , England ) is a professional racing cyclist specialising in downhill and four cross mountain bike racing , and is a multiple national champion , multiple World Cup winner , 2010 Downhill World Cup Champion , and 2010 & 2014 Downhill World Champion .  - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).  - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland.  - Mountain bike racing (shortened MTB or ATB racing) is a competitive cycle sport held on off-road terrain. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) recognised the discipline relatively late in 1990, when it sanctioned the world championships in Durango, Colorado. The first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup series took place in 1988. Its nine-race circuit covered two continentsEurope and North Americaand was sponsored by Grundig. Cross-country racing was the only World Cup sport at this time. In 1993, a six-event downhill World Cup was introduced. In 1996, cross-country mountain biking events were added to the Olympic Games. In 2006, cross-country mountain biking events became part of the World Deaf Cycling Championships for the first time in San Francisco, USA.

Article: These are the words of the captain of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235, eight seconds before the plane clipped a bridge and plunged into a Taiwanese river mere minutes after takeoff, killing 43 people on board.      The latest report by Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council into the February crash confirms that the captain of the ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft mistakenly switched off the plane's working engine after the other lost power.      The plane is designed to be able to be flown on one engine.      The report also showed that the captain had failed simulator training less than a year earlier, partly because he had demonstrated a lack of knowledge of how to respond to engine flameout at takeoff.      The aircraft, which was less than a year old, flew perilously between buildings and clipped a bridge and a taxi before crashing into the shallow Keelung River in Taiwan's capital, Taipei.      Fifteen of the 58 people on board the flight, all mainland Chinese or from Taiwan, survived.      The plane's entire cockpit crew was killed in the crash, authorities said.      Engine flameout      The findings come in the Aviation Safety Council's Factual Data Collection Group Report , a presentation of facts found in investigating the crash.      The report draws no conclusions and makes no recommendations, and a final report is to follow in April 2016.      The report showed that less than a minute after takeoff, once the plane had climbed 1,200 feet, a master warning sounded, and a display showed that there had been an engine flameout, or power failure, in engine 2.      The captain responded by pulling back on the throttle -- but on the other, working engine, shutting it off about 46 seconds after the other engine failed, causing the aircraft to stall.      The mistake was not noticed until about two minutes later, when the pilot managed to restore some power to engine 1, but it was too late to avoid the crash.

MUST WATCH TransAsia grounds 10 pilots for failing test 02:09      According to records provided to the investigators by TransAsia, the captain had previously served in the Taiwan Air Force as a pilot.      He worked for another airline briefly after leaving the Air Force, before joining TransAsia in August 2010.      He served as a first officer in the ATR 72-500 fleet, before completing upgrade training and being promoted to captain in August 2014. In November that year, he completed further training to transfer to the ATR 72-600 fleet as captain.      TransAsia training records show that during his upgrade training in April 2014, he failed a simulator check, performing unsatisfactorily on the abnormal engine start section, among others.      Among the areas of concern was that he demonstrated insufficient knowledge of dealing with engine flameout at takeoff, the instructor noted.

Hide Caption 21 of 21      Since the crash in February, the Taiwanese carrier had recruited aviation safety professionals, including Jon Beatty, CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, to join its aviation committee to provide advice, the statement said.      The airline had brought manufacturers of its aircraft to Taiwan to examine its planes, and had had all captains of its ATR craft sit \\"appropriateness\\" exams, which they had passed, it said.      TransAsia had also improved its training facilities, founding a training center and purchasing simulation planes, and had made other improvements including forming an aviation safety committee and boosting pay for staff, the airline said. ||||| TAIPEI/SINGAPORE The pilot flying a TransAsia Airways (6702.TW) ATR mistakenly switched off the plane's only working engine seconds before it crashed in February, killing 43 people, Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council (ASC) said in its latest report on Thursday.      The ASC's report also showed that Captain Liao Jian-zong had failed simulator training in May 2014, in part because he had insufficient knowledge of how to deal with an engine flame-out on take-off.      \\"Wow, pulled back the wrong side throttle,\\" Liao, 41, was heard to say on voice recordings seconds before the crash.      There appeared to be confusion in the cockpit as the two captains tried to regain control of the plane after one engine lost power about three minutes into the doomed flight.      Liao reduced the throttle on the working engine but did not appear to realize his mistake until it was too late.      He tried to restart the engines several times before a junior first officer in the cockpit said: \\"Impact, impact, brace for impact.\\"      Those were the chilling last words heard on the data recordings, according to the latest report of the ASC's investigation into the Feb. 4 crash.      Seconds later the almost new ATR 72-600, which had 58 people on board, crashed upside down into a shallow river in Taipei after it lurched between buildings, clipping an overpass and a taxi.      Fifteen people survived but all three pilots and 40 passengers and other crew died in the second crash involving a TransAsia ATR plane in a year.      A source with direct knowledge of the report told Reuters on Wednesday the working engine had been shut off.      FAILED SIMULATOR TRAINING      The ASC report, which neither assigns responsibility nor suggests recommendations, paints a more detailed picture than a preliminary report released days after the crash.      Liao, a former air force pilot, began flying commercial aircraft in 2009 and joined TransAsia the following year. He was promoted to captain in August 2014 and joined the ATR 72-600 fleet in November.      He had a total of 4,914 flight hours on ATR 72 planes.      However, the report showed that Liao failed the simulator check in May 2014 when he was being evaluated for promotion. Assessors found he had a tendency not to complete procedures and checks, and his \\"cockpit management and flight planning\\" were also found wanting.      However, he passed after a second simulator check on June 29 and 30 and was promoted to captain, although similar problems were detected during training from July 2-10 last year.      Instructors commented that he was \\"prone to be nervous and may make oral errors during the engine start procedure\\" and displayed a \\"lack of confidence\\", the report shows.      Issues cropped up again during training for the ATR 72-600 in November, when an instructor said Liao \\"may need extra training\\" when dealing with an engine failure after take-off.      After the crash, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration put TransAsia's ATR pilots through oral proficiency tests on how to handle an aircraft during engine failure.      All but one of the pilots passed the tests, although some needed more than one attempt. The lone failure was demoted in rank to vice captain from captain.      The airline now has 61 ATR pilots.      TransAsia president Fred Wu told a media conference later on Thursday the airline would buy an ATR flight simulator, bring in outside experts to evaluate pilots, and launch a safety improvement program with Airbus (AIR.PA).      ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italian aerospace firm Finmeccanica (SIFI.MI).      The airline has reached a settlement with the families of seven passengers, and negotiations were underway with the rest, said TransAsia CEO Peter Chen.      A draft of the final report will be issued in November with the final report, which will include the cause of the crash and recommendations, to be completed in April 2016.

Question: Given the background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  and the situation: Two friends met after 20 years and compared diets. Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs and was 5'8'' in height. Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin.  Answer the following question: Which friend had less unused energy in food? Answer:","output":"Mike, the friend who followed a vegan diet, likely had less unused energy in food compared to Paul, who regularly consumed junk food. There are several reasons for this conclusion. Firstly, junk food typically contains a high amount of calories, often in the form of unhealthy fats and sugars. These types of foods provide a significant amount of energy but lack essential nutrients, like vitamins and minerals. As a result, when people like Paul consume more energy than they need through junk food, their bodies store this excess energy in the form of fat. This storage can lead to weight gain and obesity, as illustrated by Paul's weight of 300 lbs and height of 5'8\\". In contrast, Mike followed a vegan diet, which emphasizes whole, plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes that are naturally lower in calories and fats while providing vital nutrients. Consuming a well-planned vegan diet can help individuals meet their nutritional needs and maintain a healthy weight. Since Mike is described as healthy and thin, it can be inferred that he consumed an appropriate amount of energy from his food, allowing him to maintain an ideal weight and avoid any significant energy storage in the form of body fat. Moreover, obesity can increase the risk of health problems, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Since Paul had a higher BMI and met the criteria for obesity, the chances of him having unused energy in his food were greater than Mike, who maintained a healthy weight and was at a lower risk for such health complications. In conclusion, based on their respective diets and weight profiles, it is more likely that Mike, the vegan friend, had less unused energy in food compared to Paul, who consumed junk food daily. By choosing plant-based foods and avoiding the empty calories often found in junk food, Mike was able to maintain a healthier weight and minimize the storage of unused energy as fat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The rebels had burned down a village and murdered, so Addison executed every last one of them.  Given the context: What does Addison need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before Addison can execute the rebels, there are several steps that need to be taken. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the process: 1. Gather intelligence about the rebels: Addison needs to gather information on the rebels responsible for the village attack, including their location, numbers, and leadership. This may involve using scouts, informants, or other intelligence sources. 2. Develop a capture strategy: Based on the information gathered, Addison must create a plan for capturing the rebels. This could involve coordinating with local military forces, planning a surprise attack, or setting a trap for the rebels. 3. Capture the rebels: Addison and his team, with support from any allied forces, must carry out the plan to capture the rebels. This might involve a direct confrontation, a covert operation, or something in-between. The goal is to apprehend the rebels with minimal casualties on both sides. 4. Secure the prisoners: Once the rebels are captured, they must be secured in a location where they cannot escape or pose a threat to themselves or others. This could involve transporting them to a jail, detention center, or other secure facility. 5. Gather evidence: Now that the rebels are in custody, Addison must gather evidence to support the accusations against them. This can include witness statements, documentation, physical evidence, or anything else that proves their involvement in the attack on the village. 6. Trial: In order to maintain a fair and just process, Addison should ensure that each captive rebel has a fair and impartial trial. This might involve appointing an impartial judge, giving the rebels access to legal representation, and presenting evidence that confirms their guilt. 7. Sentencing: If the rebels are found guilty, they will need to be sentenced according to the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction. In this case, Addison has decided to execute them, presumably because the severity of their crimes justifies the death penalty. By completing these steps, Addison can ensure that he handles the situation in a just and responsible manner, providing the accused with a fair trial, and ensuring that their punishment is in line with the severity of their crimes."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Context: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

To further elaborate, let's first define VPN and then look at how the sentences relate to each other. VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows users to create a secure and encrypted connection over the internet, typically employed to access resources on a private network, even when they are not physically connected to the same network. VPNs achieve this by creating a \\"tunnel\\" through the public internet, connecting the client device to the VPN server and then forwarding packets securely between them. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) are two common VPN tunneling protocols. PPTP is an older protocol, designed by Microsoft, while L2TP is a more advanced and secure protocol that combines features of PPTP and Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) protocol. Now, let's examine the two provided sentences: 1. Apple has also built a new VPN server into Panther Server that supports Mac OS X, Windows, or UNIX clients using PPTP and L2TP tunneling protocols. 2. A new VPN server built into Panther Server supports Mac OS X, Windows, or UNIX clients using PPTP and L2TP tunneling protocols. Both sentences describe the same key points: - Apple has built a new VPN server - This VPN server is integrated into Panther Server (a version of the Mac OS X operating system) - It supports clients running on Mac OS X, Windows, or UNIX systems - These clients can use PPTP and L2TP tunneling protocols to establish a secure connection.

Summarize: Victory in the 200m final at Rio 2016 means the 29-year-old needs another win in the 4x100m relay alongside his Jamaican team-mates at 02:35 BST on Saturday to complete an unprecedented 'treble treble' of Olympic sprint golds in the 100m, 200m and relay. He's done it all while athletics has been struggling to maintain its popularity, a succession of doping scandals draining away people's belief in what they're watching. It's not too much of a stretch to describe Bolt as his sport's saviour. His remarkable feats can, briefly, bring the world to a halt, while he possesses a magnetic appeal that transcends track and field and crosses generations. Why is he so popular? And, as BBC TV's Olympic coverage asked in the aftermath of his latest gold, what on earth are we going to do without him? Unaffected, laid-back but always the showman, Bolt makes the superhuman seem routine and his easy charm is hugely endearing. Of course, people are also awed by watching staggering sporting feats - like setting world records in the 100m of 9.58 seconds and the 200m of 19.19 seconds - but it's the way he does it that makes Bolt different. Not for him the muscular machismo of many sprinters. Swaying, dancing and posing before and after races, he looks like he's having a great time and the sense of fun is infectious. While the time we see him in action is oh so brief, he appears to have all the time in the world for fans and journalists once his business is complete. Media playback is not supported on this device His laps of honour feature a seemingly endless stream of selfies for thrilled supporters, with Bolt providing a smile for everyone. He waits patiently when some fans struggle to get the settings on their phone right and shows them how it's done when technology defeats them. Once he's amiably ambled his way round the track, it's straight into a succession of interviews,. BBC Radio 5 live's Sonia McLaughlin was number 49 in the line of media waiting to speak with Bolt after his 200m victory and he fielded similar questions with the same excitement - more than an hour after his race had finished - as he had when he spoke to the BBC's trackside television reporter Phil Jones in the immediate aftermath of his race. His appeal overwhelms some journalists who lose all semblance of professionalism and demand their own selfies. It's all in a day's work for Bolt. With his 30th birthday on Sunday and retirement due after next year's World Athletics Championships in London, let's continue to enjoy him while we still can. The man himself said: \\"What else can I do to prove I am the greatest? I'm trying to be one of the greatest, to be among Ali and Pele. I have made the sport exciting, I have made people want to see the sport. I have put the sport on a different level.\\" Fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake, 2012 Olympic 100m silver medallist and 2011 world champion: \\"Congrats to my friend and training partner Usain Bolt. Well done big man. A true inspiration and a living legend!\\" Tennis player Genie Bouchard to fellow Canadian and 200m silver medallist Andre de Grasse: \\"Silver after Bolt is really like gold am I right?\\" Wayde van Niekerk, 400m gold medallist and world record holder: \\"Congratulations Usain Bolt, King of sprints.

Here is a news article: Winter Storm In Eastern U.S. Buries Cities, Floods Coast, Kills At Least 29      Enlarge this image toggle caption Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images      A massive snowstorm that affected most of the East Coast finally ended Sunday morning, leaving in its wake 1-3 feet of snow over major cities, at least 18 storm-associated casualties and severe coastal flooding.      While the snow has stopped, the weather warnings continue. High winds will create blowing and drifting snow in some areas, the National Weather Service warns. And while New York City lifted a police-enforced travel ban on Sunday morning, many authorities are asking citizens to refrain from driving for another day as efforts to clear off the roads continue.      The snowfall totals were striking, setting records in some jurisdictions. At the D.C. National Zoo, 22 inches of snow fell; at JFK airport in New York City, 30 inches; in the western suburbs of D.C., 36 inches were recorded; in Shepherdstown, W.V., more than 40 inches. The 26.8 inches recorded in New York's Central Park is the second-highest total ever recorded — falling short of the record by just 0.1 inches, CBS reports.      Farther south, the storm's greatest impact wasn't in inches of snowfall but quarter-inches of ice. Hundreds of thousands of people lost power as ice and high winds combined to rip down power lines, and many roads were made perilous by the icy conditions.      At least 29 deaths have been attributed to the storm by the Associated Press, including a Kentucky transportation worker who died while plowing highways, a teenager who was hit by a truck while sledding behind an all-terrain vehicle and two people who died of hypothermia in Virginia.      Most of the deaths were from car crashes on snowy or icy roads. Four were caused by overexertion while shoveling snow.      If you or someone you know is shoveling snow on Sunday, the National Safety Council has some tips on how to do so safely, including taking it slow and pushing, not lifting, the snow. Moving snow is serious physical exertion and people who don't do it frequently — no matter how healthy they are — can easily overexert themselves, the NSC says.      \\"A clear driveway is not worth your life,\\" they note.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images      In addition to bringing large volumes of snow, the storm raised floodwaters along the coast. Roads have been closed and some areas have been evacuated, the Associated Press reports.      The National Weather Service had warned that the storm surge accompanying the snowstorm could be extremely damaging.      Officials from North Carolina to New York are concerned about the impact of the floods, the AP reports:      \\"In Delaware, flooding closed a popular route to the state's beaches and forced about a dozen people to leave the low-lying community of Oak Orchard. In Ocean City, Maryland, Delmarva Power cut electricity to hundreds of customers as storm surge flooding submerged equipment used to power the downtown area.\\"      In some areas, the flooding has risen even higher than it did during Hurricane Sandy three years ago, Reuters reports.

New York City recorded its second-largest snowfall since 1869, with Central Park receiving 26.8 inches by midnight — 0.1 inch shy of tying the record 26.9 inches set in 2006, the National Weather Service said.

One of the most famous horror movies of all time, The Phantom of the Opera still manages to frighten after more than 60 years. 4. The highs are way up there with the best in the tradition of Gothic fantasy. 5. The Phantom of the Opera is an ultra fantastic melodrama, an ambitious production in which there is much to marvel at in the scenic effects. 6. It has two elements of genius: It creates beneath the opera one of the most grotesque places in the cinema, and Chaney's performance transforms an absurd character into a haunting one. 7. It's not the best Chaney film -- it has slow, convoluted stretches -- but it occasionally bursts into life with its peculiar atmosphere. 8. The original 1925 version of The Phantom of the Opera gets a touch-up with a modern Goth-inspired soundtrack from the band Switchblade Symphony. 9. Who needs sound, color or even opera? We have Lon Chaney at his peak and that is more than sufficient. 10.

It is heralded as a staple in the library of any true horror movie aficionado.  The film's success is often attributed to the creative synthesis of Gothic fantasy elements, breathtaking scenic effects, and the exceptional performance of Lon Chaney in the lead role, which critics widely agree transform an absurd character into a deeply haunting one. Critics also highlight and appreciate the effort made into creating an imaginative and grotesque underworld beneath the opera house, showcasing it as a commendable element of this timeless film.  There is recognition that this film may not be Chaney's best, with some slow, uneven stretches mentioned. However, there are bursts of intriguing atmosphere and peculiarities that come to life in this film and create memorable moments that have kept the film relevant over time.  The 1925 version of this film underwent an enhancement process, adding a modern, Goth-inspired soundtrack from the band Switchblade Symphony, which some critics believe significantly enhanced the film's appeal. The presence of sound, color, or actual opera was not a concern for some critics as the essence and power of Chaney’s performance seemed to trump all.  The efforts to update and maintain the film to make it both timeless and accessible are greatly praised. It shows that \\"The Phantom Of The Opera\\" is highly deemed as a true classic of the Silent Era that is deserving of immense respect and recognition.

The United States, once a global superpower, is now in complete disarray. Cities that were once thriving are now overrun with gang violence and criminal activity. Jack Thompson, a former Marine Scout Sniper, now makes a living as a farmer in a small, peaceful rural town called Liberty in Montana. His father's cherished hunting rifle is the only reminder of his past life. One day, ruthless outlaw motorcycle gang leader, Cyrus \\"The Beast\\" Maddox, and his gang sweep through Liberty, leaving terror and destruction in their wake. In an unexpected and merciless attack, they mercilessly murder Jack's family and burn down his farm. Consumed by grief and rage, Jack takes it upon himself to single-handedly bring vengeance upon Cyrus and his gang. With his father's hunting rifle and his sharp shooting skills, Jack becomes the elusive \\"Ricochet,\\" systematically hunting down and eliminating members of Cyrus' gang with an unmatched precision. Along the way, Jack uncovers a dark secret: Cyrus has connections to a corrupt government organization responsible for the illegal arms smuggling business across the U.S. borders. The gang leader promises to grant him access to a new type of advanced weapon that could change the face of warfare forever if he brings the notorious 'Ricochet' down. Jack must now not only fight for his own vendetta but also to prevent a more sinister global threat from emerging. Partnering with a fearless veteran ex-FBI agent, Emma Travers, they unravel the massive arms conspiracy and wage a relentless battle against Cyrus, his gang, and the corrupt government officials protecting them. As the stakes get higher, Jack must come face-to-face with Cyrus and the ruthless enforcers who guard the secrets of this powerful weapon. Still undefeated, \\"Ricochet\\" will become the hero he never imagined he could, bringing a moment of justice to a crumbling world and ultimately, finding his road to redemption.

The term \\"swelling\\" here is often used as a metaphor to describe music when it grows progressively louder or more intense. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Music grows\\" is ambiguous. It could refer to several aspects of music such as its popularity, complexity, duration, or even its volume. If we interpret \\"music grows\\" as increasing in volume or intensity, then it might be possible to conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

This is because the premise directly mentions the key elements that correspond with the hypothesis: 1. The principal exhibition area, the planetarium and aquarium, and the submarine Argonaute are covered by the entry fee (or Museum Pass), which implies that the main attractions of the museum are included in the fee. The hypothesis states that \\"most of the museum is covered by a fee,\\" so this part corresponds directly to the premise. 2. The premise then states that \\"all other activities even the creative play areas for young children cost extra\\". This clearly indicates that these additional activities are not covered by the entry fee and therefore require additional payment. The hypothesis proposes that \\"the extra play areas cost extra,\\" which aligns with this portion of the premise. By examining these two key elements of the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Most of the museum is covered by a fee, but the extra play areas cost extra\\" is supported by the information provided. However, it is important to consider other potential factors such as the overall size and scope of the museum, along with the relative proportion of the additional activities and play areas in comparison to the main attractions covered by the entry fee. Although the premise specifically mentions some key details, it does not provide exhaustive information about the entire museum and all of its attractions. Consequently, while the hypothesis appears true based on the provided information, it may be necessary to consider other details and sources to better understand the overall cost structure and attractions of the museum. Nevertheless, the given premise does affirm that a significant portion of the museum—including the principal exhibition area, planetarium and aquarium, and the submarine Argonaute—are covered by a single fee, while the extra play areas and other activities are not included in the entry fee and require additional payment. Consequently, based on the information given, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Most of the museum is covered by a fee, but the extra play areas cost extra\\" is an accurate representation of the museum's pricing structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Students can work with deaf children, bring pets to nursing homes, and prepare Chinese students to become US citizens, and so on. Volunteerism develops well outside of colleges, too.

Spend 20-30 minutes in a sauna daily to sweat out drugs. Add 2 cups (400 grams) of Epsom salts to your bath water. Article:","output":"Title: Enhancing Wellness through Aerobic Exercises, Sauna Treatments, and Epsom Salt Baths Introduction The pursuit of a healthy lifestyle has become a top priority for countless individuals across the globe. People are increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting conscientious practices to improve and maintain their overall well-being. Engaging in aerobic exercises, spending time in a sauna, and incorporating Epsom salts in baths are three effective methods for boosting wellness. Let's explore each of these practices in detail to uncover the wide-ranging benefits they offer. Aerobic Exercises for Fat Burning and Cardiovascular Health Aerobic exercises, also known as cardiovascular exercises, encompass activities that elevate your heart rate and promote increased oxygen intake. These exercises are particularly effective at burning calories and shedding body fat, making them popular among those seeking weight loss or overall fitness improvement. Some common forms of aerobic exercises include walking, jogging, running, swimming, cycling, and group fitness classes such as aerobics, dance, and kickboxing. Engaging in these activities for at least 20-30 minutes per day, four to five times per week, is recommended to reap significant health benefits. In addition to aiding weight loss, regular aerobic exercise strengthens the heart and lungs, lowers resting heart rate, improves circulation and blood pressure, and ultimately reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, studies have found that engaging in aerobic exercises can also enhance mental health, helping to alleviate stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Sauna Treatments for Detoxification and Relaxation Incorporating daily sauna treatments into your wellness routine is another effective way to detoxify your body and stimulate relaxation. Sauna sessions typically last for 20-30 minutes and are conducted in a controlled environment with high temperatures and humidity levels. Sweating induced by sauna treatments helps to eliminate toxins and impurities from the body, including harmful drugs and heavy metals. In addition, saunas promote increased circulation, opening up blood vessels and enhancing the delivery of oxygen to muscles and other tissues. Aside from physical benefits, saunas may also improve mental well-being. The therapeutic heat helps to relieve tension, stress, and physical discomfort, as well as promote relaxation and an overall sense of tranquility. Some reports have even suggested that spending time in a sauna could potentially boost the production of feel-good hormones like endorphins and serotonin, resulting in enhanced mood and reduced feelings of depression. Epsom Salt Baths for Muscle Recovery and Stress Relief Epsom salts, which are made of magnesium and sulfate, provide numerous therapeutic benefits when added to a warm bath. It is generally suggested to add 2 cups (400 grams) of Epsom salts to your bath water and soak in it for at least 20 minutes. Magnesium is a crucial mineral responsible for several physiological functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood sugar regulation, and the production of proteins and energy. Soaking in an Epsom salt bath allows your body to absorb magnesium through the skin, which can help to improve muscle and nerve function, reduce inflammation, and alleviate muscle soreness. Moreover, Epsom salt baths have been noted for their stress-relieving properties. The magnesium in Epsom salts also aids in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness. As a result, soaking in an Epsom salt bath can help to mitigate the effects of stress and promote a general sense of calm. Conclusion In conclusion, incorporating aerobic exercises, sauna treatments, and Epsom salt baths into your wellness routine can significantly enhance your physical and mental well-being. These practices not only contribute to weight loss, muscle recovery, and detoxification but also promote relaxation and an overall sense of balance. By integrating these activities into your everyday life, you stand to gain a wide range of benefits that will play an instrumental role in maintaining your long-term health and wellness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gases come to a head: Due to various geologic processes below the Earth's crust, volatile gases and compounds accumulate in pockets, eventually creating pressure. This is the initial driving force for magma movement towards the surface. 2. Pushing molten magma to the surface: The built-up pressure from these gases forces the molten magma to rise towards the Earth's surface. This can happen due to the cracks or weak spots in the crust, acting as pathways for the magma.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: The 2002 Scottish Claymores season was the eighth season for the franchise in the NFL Europe League (NFLEL). The team was led by head coach Gene Dahlquist in his second year, and played four of its home games at Hampden Park in Glasgow and one at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, Scotland. They finished the regular season in fourth place with a record of five wins and five losses. Hypothesis: They finished the season with six wins.","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the context. In this case, the relevant information needed to evaluate the hypothesis is the team's win-loss record for the given season. Step 2: Extract the team's win-loss record from the context. From the provided context, we can gather that \\"They finished the regular season in fourth place with a record of five wins and five losses.\\" Step 3: Compare the extracted information with the provided hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"They finished the season with six wins.\\". Comparing this with the information extracted from the context, we see that the Claymores' record consists of five wins, not six. Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the hypothesis. Given that the context explicitly states a five-win and five-loss record, the hypothesis claiming \\"They finished the season with six wins\\" is incorrect, as it does not coincide with the facts provided in the context.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: farmer guides his sheep along a country road","output":"In the given sentence, \\"farmer guides his sheep along a country road,\\" the most important words are: 1. Farmer: This is the main subject of the sentence, and it denotes the person responsible for the action being described. The farmer is the individual who cares for the sheep and helps them navigate their way along the road. 2. Guides: This is the central verb in the sentence, indicating the action being performed by the farmer. The word 'guides' gives us information about the farmer's role and purpose in relation to the sheep and emphasizes the farmer's responsibility for directing the flock. 3. Sheep: Sheep are the objects affected by the farmer's action of guiding. They represent the flock of animals that the farmer is actively leading, and their presence in the sentence is crucial to understanding the purpose and context of the farmer's actions. 4. Country road: This phrase establishes the setting in which the action is taking place. It gives context to the reader about where the farmer is guiding the sheep - not in a city, pasture, or another location, but specifically along a country road. This is important, as it creates a mental image of the rural scene, setting the atmosphere, and providing context on the possible challenges and experiences the farmer and the sheep may encounter during their journey. In summary, \\"farmer,\\" \\"guides,\\" \\"sheep,\\" and \\"country road\\" are the most important words in the sentence, as they provide insight into the main subject, the action being performed, the objects affected, and the setting where this action occurs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon.  Keith is a physician in a local hospital. He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this.  When would the ribcage contract, state A or state B? The answer to this question is:","output":"State B. When the diaphragm relaxes, the volume of the chest cavity decreases, causing the ribcage to contract.

Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing.

Given the following context:  Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House. From here Balch Creek runs beside the Lower Macleay Trail, another hiking trail, for about 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Near Northwest Thurman Street, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) from the mouth, the creek flows through a trash rack into an 84-inch (210 cm) diameter storm sewer. City workers first diverted the creek into a pipe in the early 20th century. The water empties into the Willamette River in the city's Northwest Industrial neighborhood at Outfall 17.

In court: Thomas Ammann, 39, allegedly handed over price sensitive details about a takeover between photocopying firms involving Canon. A love-cheat investment banker helped. his two girlfriends make more than £2million by leaking insider. information, a court heard yesterday. Thomas Ammann, 39, handed over the. confidential details about a future City takeover bid to Christina. Weckwerth and Jessica Mang, it was claimed. The two women allegedly used the. sensitive insider information to ‘almost double their money’ by buying. and selling shares in one company. Ammann, who worked at the London. offices of Japanese bank Mizuho, was one of only seven at the bank who. knew that global electronics company Canon was planning a takeover of. Dutch printing firm Oce. The German banker allegedly shared. this sensitive information with his two lovers – who had no knowledge. of  each other – months before the deal became public. Weckwerth, 44,. made nearly £2million while Mang, 29, pocketed £60,000 from their. illicit trading, it was claimed. Prosecutor Amanda Pinto QC told. Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Ammann pleaded guilty to two counts. of encouraging insider dealing and two counts of insider dealing. earlier this year. She said: ‘In broad terms these  two women managed to almost  double their money by trading in just one stock. ‘Each of these women considered that Thomas Ammann was their boyfriend and they had no idea of the existence of the other.’ The court heard that on March 12,. 2009, Canon sent a confidential letter expressing its interest in a. takeover of Oce to a select group who were working on the deal,. including Ammann. The next day Weckwerth bought 14,500 shares in Oce, it. was alleged. Three days later, after a weekend with Ammann, she bought another 20,000 shares, the jury heard. The prosecutor added: ‘Thomas Ammann. and Christina Weckwerth sent several texts and had very long phone calls. on the evening of March 12. The following day, after another call, she. invested in those shares.’ And in April 2009 Weckwerth approached. the Bank of Cyprus with a view to setting up her own company to handle. her share trades, it was said.

Plot title: Once Movie plot: A thirty-something busker performs with his guitar on Grafton Street, a Dublin shopping district and chases a man who steals his money. Lured by his music, a young Czech flower seller talks to him about his songs. Delighted to learn that he repairs hoovers, she insists that he fix her broken hoover. The next day she returns with her broken hoover and tells him that she is also a musician. At a music store where the Czech woman regularly plays piano, the man teaches her one of his songs (\\"Falling Slowly\\"); they sing and play together. He invites her to his father's shop, and on the bus home musically answers her question about what his songs are about: a long-time girlfriend who cheated on him, then left (\\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\\"). At the shop, the man introduces the woman to his father and takes her to his room, but when he asks her to stay the night, she feels insulted and leaves. The next day, they reconcile and spend the week writing, rehearsing and recording songs. The woman rehearses lyrics for one of his songs (\\"If You Want Me\\"), singing to herself while walking down the street; at a party, people perform impromptu (including \\"Gold\\"). The man works on \\"Lies\\", a song about his ex-girlfriend, who moved to London. The woman encourages him to win her back. Invited to the woman's home, the man discovers that she has a toddler and lives with her mother. He decides to move to London, but he wants to record a demo of his songs to take with him and asks the woman to record it with him. They secure a bank loan and reserve time at a recording studio. The man learns the woman has a husband in the Czech Republic. When he asks if she still loves her husband, she answers in Czech, \\"Miluju tebe\\",[4] but coyly declines to translate. After recruiting a band from other buskers, they go into the studio to record. They impress Eamon, the jaded studio engineer, with their first song (\\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\").

Here is a question about this article: On the other hand, classical (analog) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized, because in urban areas buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation. Using horizontal polarization, ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (horizontal polarization off the side of a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization. Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas. In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction. What is the answer to this question: What cause less problems in digital terrestrial television?","output":"Digital terrestrial television experiences fewer problems with ghosting and multipath propagation due to the robust nature of binary transmissions and the incorporation of error correction techniques. Unlike analog television, digital television transmits data in the form of binary code, which consists of 0s and 1s, making the signal less susceptible to degradation from reflections or interference. Additionally, digital television employs error correction algorithms that can detect and correct errors in the transmitted data, ensuring a more consistent and reliable signal quality. These features make digital terrestrial television better suited to handling the challenges posed by multipath propagation in both urban and rural areas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. ‘In-Betweeners’ Are Part of a Rich Recruiting Pool for Jihadists “Many of them just take their grievances and dress them up in the garb of Islam,” Mr. Bergen said. That has become easy in the age of the internet. The attackers in San Bernardino, Orlando and New York all had expressed support for the Islamic State, and they and the Boston bombers were devotees of the voluminous online work of Mr. Awlaki, who was killed in an American drone strike in 2011. He remains highly popular on the web, where he argues that Western Muslims must reject even the friendliest non-Muslim neighbors, whom he calls “Sally Soccer Mom and Joe Six-Pack.” Mr. Rahami wrote in his journal that “Sheikh Anwar,” as well as Mr. Adnani of the Islamic State, had “said it clearly”: “Attack the kuffar,” or non-Muslims, “in their backyard.” Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris and the author of “Radicalization,” said Muslims in Europe more often than those in America felt “frontally rejected” by the larger society. He said he has often seen in his research individuals who felt neither French nor Arab. “In France, they are blamed for not being French enough, and when they go to their parents’ country of origin, they are blamed for not being Arab enough,” Mr. Khosrokhavar said. “That double denial can push them to adhere to a radical version of Islam, as a kind of lifeline: Since I am neither French nor Arab, neither American nor Afghan, I am Muslim and to hell with you all,” he added. These roots of radicalization do not make immigrants in general a danger. In the United States, immigrants have a lower rate of crime and violence than other Americans. Converts to Islam are disproportionately represented among Americans and Europeans drawn to extremism, and other ideologies also motivate mass violence — as in the case of Dylann Roof, who was 21 when he fatally shot nine black people last year at a church in Charleston, S.C., in the name of white supremacy. “The actual content of the ideology is secondary,” said Mr. Meloy, the psychologist. “What’s important is the identification and fixation.” But the Islamist terrorist groups target the particular anxieties of Western Muslims from immigrant backgrounds, posing recruitment as a religious loyalty test. They call on supporters to reject the nations where they live and embrace instead a devotion to the ummah, the global community of Muslims. The West is at war with Islam, they say, and you must strike out to defend your fellow Muslims. That message has been delivered with particular power by Mr. Awlaki, often reinforcing the newer propaganda efforts of the Islamic State. As an imam who counseled immigrants at three American mosques, and as a Yemeni-American who had lived in both countries and in Britain, Mr. Awlaki understood the worries of Muslims in the West. When he joined Al Qaeda, he did his best to open a gulf between them and their non-Muslim neighbors. “The important lesson to learn here is: Never, ever trust a kuffar,” Mr. Awlaki said in a 2003 lecture in London that was captured on video and remains a YouTube favorite. “Now, you might argue and say: ‘But my neighbor is such a nice person. My classmates are very nice. My co-workers — they’re just fabulous people, they’re so decent and honest.’” Yet these non-Muslims can never be relied upon, he said. Later, after moving to Yemen, he spoke not only of shunning non-Muslims, but also of attacking them. In a 2010 video, he tried to shame his listeners into choosing his brand of religion over their country. “To the Muslims in America I have this to say: How can your conscience allow you to live in peaceful coexistence with a nation that is responsible for the tyranny and crimes committed against your own brothers and sisters?” he said. “How can you have your loyalty to a government that is leading the war against Islam and Muslims?” He has led many people down the jihadist path, and not just in English-speaking countries. The Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group based in Washington, said Wednesday that it had counted 88 “extremists” who had been influenced by Mr. Awlaki: 54 in the United States and 34 in Europe. Most such jihadist recruits are the children of immigrants, said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, and the author of “Globalized Islam.” His research shows that 65 percent of Muslim extremists in France and Belgium are from this second generation. “These young people have broken away from their parents, who they blame for many things — for practicing the wrong Islam, for having brought them to the West, for having failed in life,” Mr. Roy said, noting that Mr. Rahami reportedly had clashed with his father. But such conflicts pass. Few jihadists are from the third generation, the grandchildren of immigrants, he said. Scott Shane reported from Washington, Richard Pérez-Peña from New York, Aurelien Breeden from Paris. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The \\"In-Betweeners\\" often feel rejected by their native society and their parents' homeland, leading them to embrace radical ideologies out of a sense of identity and belonging.

That's when Apple, a year after launching the iPhone, introduced its App Store to the world. The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded. Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads. But the iPhone was the first smartphone most folks ever saw, and the App Store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness. On this anniversary, we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the App Store and expanded the capabilities of our phones. 'Angry Birds' Before the App Store, video games were, by and large, for hard-core players with consoles or souped-up PCs. Now the line between who is a gamer and who's not is blurry -- and millions of people have \\"Angry Birds\\" to thank. The deceptively addictive little game, in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses, is the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history. Since its launch in 2009, the game has become a franchise, with spinoffs, toys, cartoons and even a movie making up just part of Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment's furious, feathered empire. Addicted gamers are sweet on 'Candy Crush' Google Maps. With the rise of Google's Android system as Apple's chief mobile rival, there's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the App Store's success. But since Google Maps rolled out as a native app for the iPhone, the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing's key features. (Does anyone still hand-draw maps?) Yes, there are other map apps out there. But Google's treasure-trove of data makes its maps a go-to for millions. Witness the mini-disaster Apple had on its hands when it bumped Google's offering for its own Maps app last year. Apple's product was so half-baked that CEO Tim Cook, in a rare mea culpa, essentially told users to download Google Maps until it was fixed. How to kickstart your holiday using apps not maps. Pandora. By 2008 Pandora already had become a popular Web-streaming service, letting users seed their own personal radio stations with bands or songs they liked. But the company was quick to see the potential in mobile computing, and Pandora was among the first apps available when the App Store went live. Since then, it's become the second-most downloaded iPhone app in the store's history, trailing only Facebook. Its proof of concept -- that users want to be able to bring their music with them anywhere -- also helped inspire a host of competitors, from Spotify to Rdio to Last.fm. Why everybody's building a Web music service. Instagram. Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, made all of us photographers. That's a huge shift. But, sadly for most of us, it didn't make us all good photographers. Enter Instagram -- with a slate of editing tools and funky filters that can make even the most pedestrian pictures look good. Add to that Instagram's social features, complete with Twitter-like hashtags, and you've got a tool tailor-made for mobile. Launched in 2010 by Stanford University students, Instagram now moves about 45 million images every day. Oh ... and those creators also sold it to Facebook last year for a cool 1 billion. Instagram launches 15-second video feature. Shazam. It seems like a little thing, until you stop and think about it: What if your phone could listen to a few seconds of a song, then tell you what it is? That would have sounded like magic not so many years ago. Now, we take it for granted. Shazam started in the UK in 2002 as a Web service. But it was front and center at the beginning of the mobile revolution, and is now among Apple's Top 10 downloaded apps, with 350 million users. 20 fun and useful new mobile apps.

Enabled by the app store, five iconic apps have changed the way we use our smartphones: 1. Angry Birds: Since its launch in 2009, this addictive game has become the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history. Creator Rovio Entertainment has expanded the Angry Birds franchise into spinoffs, toys, and even movies. 2.

Solve this instance: Abstract: In vivo activation of Klebsiella aerogenes urease, a nickel-containing enzyme, requires the presence of functional UreD, UreF, and UreG accessory proteins and is further facilitated by UreE. These accessory proteins are proposed to be involved in metallocenter assembly (M. H. Lee, S. B. Mulrooney, M. J. Renner, Y. Markowicz, and R. P. Hausinger, J. Bacteriol. 174:4324-4330, 1992). A series of three UreD-urease apoprotein complexes are present in cells that express ureD at high levels, and these complexes are thought to be essential for in vivo activation of the enzyme (I.-S. Park, M. B. Carr, and R. P. Hausinger, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3233-3237, 1994). In this study, we describe the effect of accessory gene deletions on urease complex formation. The ureE, ureF, and ureG gene products were found not to be required for formation of the UreD-urease complexes; however, the complexes from the ureF deletion mutant exhibited delayed elution during size exclusion chromatography. Because these last complexes were of typical UreD-urease sizes according to native gel electrophoretic analysis, we propose that UreF alters the conformation of the UreD-urease complexes. The same studies revealed the presence of an additional series of urease apoprotein complexes present only in cells containing ureD, ureF, and ureG, along with the urease subunit genes. These new complexes were shown to contain urease, UreD, UreF, and UreG. We propose that the UreD-UreF-UreG-urease apoprotein complexes represent the activation-competent form of urease apoprotein in the cell..

How Entrepreneurs Are Using the Sharing Economy to Boost Business For six years, Harry Campbell had a good gig as an aerospace engineer for Boeing ba . His job at the Fortune 500 company offered structure, stability, and predictability. But Campbell, 29, was looking for flexible work hours and creative ways to diversify his income. So in 2014 he turned to Uber and began driving for the ridesharing service part-time. He quickly found that being an Uber driver involved more than just taking passengers from point A to point B. “Some drivers treat it as a really casual part-time gig, but what you’re really doing is running your own business,” he says. “You have to think about how much money you’re making in addition to expenses, insurance, liability and taxes.” After driving for a few months, he decided to launch a blog and podcast called The Rideshare Guy to help other drivers run their businesses effectively. While that’s become a full-time endeavor, Campbell still finds time to participate in the on-demand economy: in addition to Uber, he works for ridesharing company Lyft, delivery service Postmates and restaurant delivery startup DoorDash. Campbell is part of a growing demographic of business owners who choose to partake in the sharing economy. Intuit recently conducted a study surveying more than 4,600 on-demand economy workers and found that 39% own their own businesses and 32% want to be their own boss. “We see workers having three different sources of income just to maintain a standard of living,” says Alex Chriss, general manager of Intuit’s intu self-employed solutions small–business unit. The study cites work flexibility, control and autonomy as workers’ primary incentives, but there are some surprising benefits that explain why more and more entrepreneurs are drawn to the perks of the on-demand economy. For one, there’s the social aspect. “The hardest thing for me when I left my engineering job was not even the money or the risk, it was really just leaving all my friends and co-workers,” Campbell says. Getting out of the house to drive strangers around has helped — and it seems to have worked both ways. “I’ve had passengers really open up to me,” he says. “A lot of drivers joke that we’re actually therapists.” Related: Meet the Secretive Startup Trying to Steal Uber’s Top Drivers Dar Sandler, 33, who drove for Uber while working on his fintech startup describes himself as “a super social person who will talk to anyone.” He primarily used Uber to supplement his income, sometimes making 50 to 60 an hour when he worked during Boston’s record snowstorms, but it was the human interaction he valued most. “It’s a great way to network, especially if you’re in Boston or New York where you’re driving people with a little bit more wealth and status,” he says. “Although the irony is that a lot of times they view you as just a driver.” He remembers picking up a passenger who worked in consulting. The passenger began explaining his job, assuming Sandler wasn’t familiar with the industry terminology. “When we started having an intelligent conversation, he was like ‘Oh, this guy really knows his shit,’” he says. “And then they wonder, ‘Why are you driving for Uber?’” Related: 5 Things to Know About How the Feds See the ‘Sharing’ Economy Taking a job in the gig economy also lets entrepreneurs dabble in experiences that can inspire them without a ton of investment. Arianna Spiros, 25, recently launched a jewelry business, Kalí Zoë Designs. While she was developing the idea, she spent time working as a yoga instructor on sailboats through FindACrew, a platform that connects boat owners with a crew. “I tutored students while laying the framework of my business because I’m inspired by traveling and living outdoors,” she says. “It wasn’t directly jewelry-related, but it was a fun way to explore and learn.” Spiros has found that many people in the on-demand economy share a similar entrepreneurial spirit. For instance, when she moved to Chicago without a car, she used Uber as her main form of transportation. One of the drivers, who is an aspiring entrepreneur in the music industry, agreed to do the music for her company’s promotional video. In return, she helped him with logistics in creating music for yoga classes and yoga festivals. “I have a lot of interests, and I’m lucky that some of these passions give me the opportunity to make money,” Spiros says. “I’d rather grow them into my own career than do something solely for money. I really value my freedom.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses how entrepreneurs are leveraging the sharing economy to boost their businesses. The sharing economy offers individuals flexible work hours, additional income streams, and creative opportunities to diversify their income. Work flexibility, control, and autonomy are the primary incentives attracting entrepreneurs to the sharing economy. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for social interaction, networking, and exploring potential avenues for inspiration while working in a sharing economy-based role. For example, Harry Campbell, a former aerospace engineer, began driving for Uber as a side gig, which led him to launch a blog and podcast to help other drivers run their businesses effectively. Dar Sandler, who drove for Uber while working on his fintech startup, cites the social aspect and networking opportunities as valuable benefits. Arianna Spiros, who started her jewelry business, gained inspiration and networking opportunities while working as a yoga instructor on sailboats through an online platform.

Given the background: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.  and the situation: Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  Answer the following question: Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","output":"The temperature that will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on Robert's cupcakes is 0° F. There are two primary factors to consider when determining the optimal temperature for food preservation through freezing: 1. The effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates: Lower temperatures slow down chemical and enzymatic reactions that contribute to food spoilage. The rate of these reactions generally decreases as the temperature is reduced. Thus, by storing the cupcakes at 0° F, the rate of spoilage will be lower than at 10° F. 2. The effect of freezing on water availability for bacterial growth: Freezing affects the water molecules' ability to move and interact with other molecules, thus decreasing the rate at which bacteria can access water for their growth and proliferation. When water freezes, it forms ice crystals, which prevents the water from being available to bacteria. Moreover, the colder the temperature, the more ice crystals are formed, which further limits the available water for bacterial growth. In comparing the two temperatures, 0° F provides a more effective method for preserving the cupcakes' freshness because of the enhanced impact of lower temperatures on reaction rates and reduced water availability. The 0° F temperature will cause the water within the cupcakes to freeze more rapidly, reducing the amount of available water for micro-organisms and slowing down chemical reactions that can lead to food spoilage and decay. In conclusion, Robert should store his unsold cupcakes at 0° F in the freezer. This lower temperature will provide him with a greater level of protection against food spoilage and bacterial growth, ensuring that the cupcakes can be preserved for a longer period with minimal quality loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Firefighters were called after the blaze broke out in Jedburgh Avenue, Heaton, Bolton, just after 02:30 GMT. A smoke alarm woke the sleeping family, who have been praised for the \\"quick thinking and decisive action\\" that may have saved their lives. The home was badly damaged but the residents escaped unharmed.

She was a White House fellow in 1980-81, serving as special assistant to the attorney general and working on the nomination process of Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Supreme Court justice. She was also counsel to Professor Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in 1992. Emma Coleman Jordan says Sonia Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial. (ESSENCE)  -- As Judge Sonia Sotomayor prepares to become the next U.S. Supreme Court justice, her lifetime of diligence and speed reading will now be crucial to help her navigate the next phase of her nomination. After her press conference with the president last week, more than likely she went straight to a briefing session in which she was given several thick briefing books, filled with memos that identify the most difficult questions of constitutional law that the members of the OPTIONS: - Anita Hill are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Clarence Thomas are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Coleman Jordan are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Emma Coleman Jordan are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Georgetown University are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Georgetown University Law Center are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Sandra Day O'Connor are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Senate are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Sonia Sotomayor are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - Supreme Court are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - U.S. are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. - White House are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing.","output":"Senate are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing.  Judge Sonia Sotomayor, with her extensive experience and impressive track record, is expected to face a series of tough questions during the Senate confirmation hearings. While her supporters praise her for her thorough understanding of the law and judicial temperament, there are those who may scrutinize her stance on controversial constitutional issues, past opinions, and potential biases. As these hearings are pivotal in determining her fitness for serving on the nation's highest court, Sotomayor will need to rely on her skills, legal knowledge, and years of experience to answer these questions convincingly and genuinely. Emma Coleman Jordan's statement regarding the majority of Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions being uncontroversial should aid in the overall perception of her qualifications for the role. In the weeks leading up to the confirmation hearings, Sotomayor will have to prepare diligently by studying her previous rulings, examining legal precedents, and anticipating the line of questioning that the Senate is likely to take. She will need to be ready to defend her judicial philosophy, provide her perspective on important constitutional questions, and address any potential concerns that may be raised. Through this process, the Senate will aim to get to know Sotomayor and her judicial outlook and evaluate her suitability for the critical role of a Supreme Court Justice. As history has shown, the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees can be intense and unpredictable affairs. However, by using her intelligence, extensive experience, and strong work ethic, Judge Sonia Sotomayor stands a good chance of successfully navigating this key milestone in her career and ultimately taking her place in the esteemed ranks of the U.S. Supreme Court."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cellphone footage taken from a bystander revealed the heartbreaking moments as Garner repeatedly shouted \\"I can't breathe\\" while officers pinned him to the ground during an attempted arrest. The video shows Mr. Garner appearing to lose consciousness as a result of the forceful restraint. He was quickly taken to Richmond Medical Center, where he later died following a cardiac arrest.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"While it is not recommended to make a \\"drinkable\\" room spray, as room sprays are often composed of ingredients not safe for consumption, you can create an aromatic and versatile spray using all-natural ingredients that can be used as a room freshener and, if desired, added into beverages in small quantities. Here's a detailed guide on creating an all-natural, non-toxic, and multi-purpose aromatic spray: Ingredients: 1. Distilled water (8 ounces) 2. Witch hazel (2 ounces) 3. Pure, food-grade essential oils (10-20 drops, depending on your preference) Instructions: 1. Choose safe food-grade essential oils: Begin by selecting pure, food-grade essential oils made from organic sources. This is important because not all essential oils are safe for consumption, and you want to ensure their quality. Some popular food-grade essential oils include lavender, peppermint, citrus oils (e.g., lemon, orange, bergamot), and herbs (e.g., rosemary, basil, lemongrass). 2. Prepare the spray bottle: Find a clean, dark glass spray bottle to store your homemade spray. Dark glass will help protect the essential oils from direct sunlight and prevent degradation over time. 3. Mix the ingredients: Pour two ounces of witch hazel into the spray bottle. Witch hazel is a natural preservative and can help extend the shelf life of your spray while also blending it properly with essential oils. Next, add 10-20 drops of your chosen food-grade essential oils. The exact number of drops will depend on the intensity of the fragrance you desire. You can mix and match various essential oils to create unique scents or stick to your favorite single scent. Lastly, pour eight ounces of distilled water into the spray bottle, filling the bottle almost to the top. Leave a small gap to facilitate shaking the solution later. 4. Shake the mixture: Secure the spray bottle's top, and shake the mixture vigorously to ensure that the witch hazel, essential oils, and distilled water are blended evenly. 5. Use the spray: Your homemade natural aromatic spray is now ready for use. Shake the bottle before each use to ensure the ingredients are well-blended. Spray the solution in living spaces, bedrooms, and bathrooms to refresh the air. Since you used food-grade essential oils, you can also add a drop or two of the scented water to beverages if you wish. However, keep in mind that using too much at once might overpower the taste of your drink and may not be safe. Remember, moderation is key when it comes to using this multi-purpose spray in beverages. Always be cautious, and consult a professional or reliable source if you have any concerns about adding essential oils to your drinks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The northern California Bay Area's biggest earthquake in 25 years has people asking: Is the world seeing more tremors than usual? And is the long-dreaded \\"Big One\\" that could devastate California coming soon? Actually, experts say the world might not be seeing more than usual. And as for the Big One, there's no sign that it's imminent. The infamous San Andreas Fault is due for its epic every-150-years rumble. But the quake that struck Sunday, centered about 6 miles southwest of Napa, wasn't on that line. \\"I don't think we can make any connection on that,\\" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. \\"This is on a different fault -- still part of the same system, still the plates are still shifting from California, the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate.\\" The","output":"recent earthquake in the Bay Area has certainly shaken the nerves of many residents and brought attention to the ever-looming threat of a massive, potentially devastating seismic event. However, while this recent tremor was significant, it is not necessarily indicative of an increase in overall seismic activity. Earthquakes are natural occurrences that result from the movement of tectonic plates along fault lines. These movements release energy that travels through the Earth's crust, causing the shaking and vibrations experienced during an earthquake. The frequency of earthquakes is influenced by many factors, including the rate of plate movement, geological processes, and even human activities like mining and reservoir impoundment. It is essential to note that the recent Bay Area earthquake occurred on a different fault line than the notorious San Andreas Fault, which is responsible for some of California's most catastrophic earthquakes in the past. The San Andreas Fault is indeed expected to produce a significant quake at some point in the future, but predicting the exact timing of such an event remains impossible with current scientific knowledge. In summary, while the recent earthquake in northern California has raised concerns about the potential for an increase in global seismic activity and the possible occurrence of the \\"Big One,\\" experts maintain that this event does not necessarily indicate a surge in earthquakes around the world or a harbinger of imminent catastrophe. As always, it is crucial for residents in earthquake-prone regions to remain vigilant and prepared for the unpredictable nature of these seismic events."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine  _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment  plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas.

I read this background article the other day: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  I am facing a new situation today: Two plants of the same type are growing near the outskirts of the Jorah forest. The first plant, colored red, is healthy and has no fungus on it. The other plant, colored black, has a fungus growing on the roots of it. These plants have been around for centuries and if crushed into a powder actually make a nice seasoning to add to a meal.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which color plant is sharing access to its glucose?","output":"Based on the information from the background article on mycorrhizal associations, it can be inferred that the black-colored plant with a fungus growing on its roots is the one sharing access to its glucose. This is because mycorrhizal associations involve a symbiotic relationship between the plant and the fungus, where the plant provides the fungus with glucose, and the fungus helps the plant with increased water and nutrient absorption. In this situation, the black plant has a mycorrhizal association and would be the one sharing its glucose with the fungus.

Please answer this question: Which term has come into use for musicals based on a catalogue of previously released songs?","output":"The term that has come into use for musicals based on a catalogue of previously released songs is \\"jukebox musical.\\" Jukebox musicals are a subgenre of musical theater where the story is either built around or inspired by a collection of pre-existing songs, rather than having an original score specifically composed for the show. These musicals often pay tribute to a specific musical artist, genre, or era and utilize their songs to propel the narrative, create a particular mood, or evoke memories associated with the music. The concept of jukebox musicals evolved from the mid-20th century practice of including hit songs from popular music charts in stage productions and movies. The term itself is derived from the jukebox, a coin-operated machine that plays selected recorded music when a specific song is chosen from its catalogue. Jukebox musicals mirror this idea by weaving together popular songs to tell a story or celebrate a specific style of music. The popularity of jukebox musicals has grown significantly since the late 1990s and early 2000s, with several groundbreaking productions achieving worldwide success. Some notable examples of jukebox musicals include: 1. Mamma Mia! (1999) - Based on the music of the Swedish pop group ABBA, Mamma Mia! is one of the most successful jukebox musicals of all time, with its story revolving around a young girl trying to uncover the identity of her father before her wedding day. 2. Jersey Boys (2005) - Featuring the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, Jersey Boys tells the story of the band's formation, rise to fame, and eventual disbandment. The show has garnered numerous awards and critical acclaim for its representation of the iconic group's musical journey. 3. We Will Rock You (2002) - Based on the songs of British rock band Queen, We Will Rock You is set in a dystopian future where music is heavily controlled by a powerful corporation. The story follows a group of rebels who try to bring back the essence of rock music and break free from the oppressive regime. 4. Beautiful: The Carole King Musical (2013) - This biographical musical tells the story of American singer-songwriter Carole King, following her career from her early beginnings as a songwriter to her rise as a successful solo artist. The show features several of King's notable hits, showcasing her immense impact on the music industry. 5. Ain't Too Proud (2018) - Based on the life and music of The Temptations, Ain't Too Proud highlights the group's career, from their formation in the 1960s to the present day. The show delves into the struggles, triumphs, and interpersonal relationships between the members while highlighting their hit songs throughout the years. Jukebox musicals have gained popularity with audiences for their nostalgic value and the familiarity of their music. Despite occasional criticism for their reliance on pre-existing material, these musicals continue to captivate theatergoers and provide an entertaining showcase for the timeless music that has shaped and defined generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:A team at Duke University used a system known as CRISPR-Cas9 to delete DNA that was preventing cells from producing a protein essential for muscle function. And a virus was used to deliver DNA alterations into the cells of mice. Writing in the journal Science, the team say when they injected the therapy direct into the legs of adult mice, it resulted in improved muscle strength. When they injected it into the bloodstream - tests showed improvements in muscles responsible for heart and lung function. Chris Nelson, who led the research, said: \\"A major hurdle for gene editing is delivery. \\"We know what genes need to be fixed for certain diseases, but getting the gene editing tools where they need to go is a huge challenge. \\"The best way we have to do it right now is to take advantage of viruses, because they have spent billions of years evolving to figure out how to get their own viral genes into cells.\\" CRISPR-Cas9 is a simple, fast and inexpensive gene editing system discovered three years ago, which is now being used by laboratories all over the world. It combines sections of synthetic DNA - CRISPRs - with a protein known as Cas9. Rather like a sat nav, Crispr scans the genome looking for the right location and then uses the Cas9 protein as molecular scissors to snip through the DNA. DMD is a genetic disease that gradually causes weakness and loss of muscle function. Humans with the condition lack normal dystrophin, a protein found in muscles, which helps to protect muscles from injury. In patients with the disease, the muscles become damaged and eventually stop working. The inherited disease usually affects only boys - about a 100 babies a year in the UK are affected.  Few of those affected live beyond their early 30s. Although this research was in mice, it has raised hopes of a treatment for humans at some point in the future. Prof Peter Braude, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology from King's College London, said: \\"This is an exciting paper demonstrating in laboratory mice the feasibility of a non-controversial use of the new CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to treat a serious and slowly lethal genetic disease.\\" Prof Adrian Thrasher, from the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, described it as an \\"important study demonstrating proof of principle of gene editing in vivo for neuromuscular disease, but still some way to go before translatable to human subjects.\\" In a second study, also in Science, a team at Harvard University used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in egg and sperm cells of mice carrying DMD. Eighty per cent of baby mice born following germline modification showed successful DNA editing. Germline alterations - changes to the DNA that are passed down the generations - is a more controversial use of gene editing. It raises ethical issues, as the technology could in theory be used to produce \\"designer\\" humans, with embryos being tweaked to enhance their physical or mental abilities. Others argue it could be a vital tool for curing serious genetic conditions like DMD, Huntington's Disease or Cystic Fibrosis. The team at Harvard also used gene editing to treat DMD-affected mice a few days after birth via injections into the abdomen, muscles or the back of the eye, with each method improving muscle function.

Before putting your clothes on, rub moisturizer into your legs, torso, and arms. Work it into your skin until there are no visible globs of lotion remaining. Moisturizer will dispel static as your clothes absorb it from your skin.  By moisturizing your skin, you remove dryness that would otherwise attract a highly-charged fabric. You can rub lotion over your hands before removing laundry from the dryer or folding your clothes. This will prevent excess electrical charge from transferring from your hands to the fabric. If static cling from your clothing is causing your hair to become frizzy, get a moisturizing conditioner or hair product. When you shower, rub the conditioner through your hair after shampooing. If you’re using a moisturizing hair product, dry your hair and work the product through each section of your hair before styling it.  Silicone-based conditioners will help keep static away from your hair more effectively, but there’s a lot of debate over whether silicone is good for your hair or not. Moisturizing your hair will keep your hair from drying out. Dry hair is prone to attracting static electricity, which is what causes static cling. Most shoes have rubber soles. This presents a problem with static though, since static charges can build up in rubber. If you find your clothes developing static cling throughout the day, swap your shoes out for a pair of leather-soled shoes. Wearing leather shoes will help you stay grounded since leather does not build up electrical charge as easily as rubber. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article above would be: To remove static cling, moisturizing your skin and hair can help prevent the build-up of static electricity.

Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider, and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What much was surpassed in the 20th century? Answer:","output":"The 20th century surpassed all earlier centuries combined in terms of growth in the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP). This includes the 19th century which was notable for its Industrial Revolution. The growth magnitude was so large that many economists argue that it's understated. The per-capita GDP grew by a factor of five over the course of the 20th century. This tremendous growth was accompanied by dramatic changes and improvements in different sectors. For instance, medical advancements that were not available at any price at the start of century, significantly improved towards the end, resulting in world life expectancy increasing by more than two decades. The communication technologies also underwent significant advancements and growth during this time period. However, it's worth noting that despite these phenomenal economic and technological advancements, wealth distribution worldwide did not occur uniformly. The divide between the rich and the poor grew wider. The majority of the global population remained situated on the poorer side of this divide. Therefore, while the 20th century saw remarkable growth in terms of per-capita GDP and advancements in key sectors like medicine and communications, it also resulted in increased income inequality globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Who recommends using serum? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Selina  B. Beautystorm.com  C.

This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  and the situation: The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. He started studying the weather there as well.  Answer the following question: Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life?

Context: After initially stating that Adrian Peterson would return to the active roster for their Week 3 game at New Orleans, the Vikings later placed the running back on the inactive list indefinitely, pending the outcome of the court case against him. Despite coming into the game at 0-3, the Saints started well, scoring two touchdowns on their first two drives, although DE Everson Griffen was able to block the extra point attempt on the second. The Vikings responded to going 13-0 down with two field goals from 25 and 30 yards respectively, but an injury to Matt Cassel meant a debut for rookie QB Teddy Bridgewater. K Blair Walsh hit a 40-yard field goal to open the second half for the Vikings, but New Orleans closed the game out with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees to Marques Colston early in the fourth quarter. They were aided on the drive by a penalty for unnecessary roughness against CB Captain Munnerlyn for a tackle on Brees, but many thought that Brees should also have been penalized for his reaction and the penalties offset. Regardless, the Vikings were forced to punt on their next possession and the Saints were able to run out the clock for a 20-9 win. Question: How many points did the Saints win by?

While both countries are aware of the challenges presented by their complex history, the talks signify a willingness to work through these issues and pave the way for better relations. Several points of discussion are likely to be addressed during this meeting, such as the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, economic cooperation, and trade. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has previously had implications for Turkey, due to Turkey's close ties with Azerbaijan. In these talks, both the Turkish and Armenian sides may express their views on how to resolve the conflict peacefully and ensure stability in the region. Economic cooperation and trade are also essential topics for the two countries, as they are exploring ways to enhance their economic ties in a bid to benefit both nations. Encouraging trade and investment, and identifying areas of potential collaboration, could strengthen their economic partnership and lead to mutual gains. Additionally, there may be discussions surrounding the historical issue of the Armenian Genocide. The Armenian Genocide was perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire during World War I when around 1.5 million Armenians were killed.

Jessica is the older daughter of Alice and Michael and has a younger sister named Casey (played by Tina Majorino). Throughout the story, Jessica is depicted as being affected by her mother's addiction and the turmoil it brings upon their family, including Alice's rehabilitation stint and Michael's attempts to hold everything together. Jessica's experiences reflect the challenges faced by children in families dealing with substance abuse, such as fear, abandonment, emotional pain, and fractured relationships. Mae Whitman's portrayal of Jessica in \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" was well-received by critics and audiences, demonstrating her ability to convey a range of emotions as a young actress.

Who is the narrator likely to vote for on the first Tuesday in November 2020 ?","output":"Based on the provided text, the narrator is highly critical of the Republican party and expresses strong disapproval of their perceived lack of concern for certain issues. They specifically mention that Republicans do not seem to care about others' plights unless it affects them directly or is extremely prominent, such as with unborn fetuses. As the narrator is clearly dissatisfied with the Republican party and shows no affinity or support for it, it is highly unlikely that they would choose to vote for Republican candidates on the first Tuesday in November 2020. This date is significant in the United States as it is the usual day for the presidential election, along with other various state and local elections. Since the other major political party in the United States is the Democratic party, it is relatively more likely that the narrator would choose to vote for Democratic candidates. Although the provided text does not explicitly mention support for the Democratic party, the political context often features a two-party system, resulting in voters primarily choosing between Republican or Democratic candidates. Moreover, other possibilities might be that the narrator could vote for a third-party or independent candidate to voice their frustration with the main political parties. Alternatively, they could choose not to participate in the electoral process altogether by abstaining from voting, which might indicate their dissatisfaction with the two-party system and the options provided. In conclusion, while the narrator's preference is not explicitly stated, it is most likely that they would vote for the Democratic party or a third-party/independent candidate on the first Tuesday in November 2020, due to their critical stance on the Republican party and the assumption that they are still engaging in the voting process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, his fortune comes with a condition: he must spend 30 million within 30 days and have nothing to show for it. If Hank fails, he loses the remaining 90 million. As Hank embarks on an unimaginable spending spree, he learns about the true value of money, friendship, and love. Plot: Opening with the sudden death of wealthy entrepreneur James Brewster in a car accident, Hank Brewster is informed about the unexpected multi-million-dollar inheritance that is to come his way. The eccentric James had left a will that stated his heir could only receive the remaining fortune if they could understand the worth of money by spending 30 million dollars in a month. Hank, an honest and hardworking small-town mechanic, initially assumes it's a ridiculous prank. However, when an official lawyer, Sarah Thompson, presents the legal documents, he realizes the great challenge ahead. Hank initially believes the task to be easy and indulges in luxurious items such as sports cars, a mansion, tailored suits, and lavish parties. With the help of his best friend, Mike, Hank receives assistance in managing his newfound wealth, which only prompts him into making extravagant and impulsive decisions. As news of his wealth and outrageous lifestyle spread, Hank starts attracting a motley crew of sycophants and gold-diggers, who become increasingly drawn to the frivolous millionaire. Among them is the cunning entrepreneur, Vincent Walker, who attempts to exploit Hank's wealth and naivety to invest in his shady business ventures.  Sarah Thompson, the lawyer assigned to oversee Hank's execution of the will, becomes his voice of reason during his spending journey. However, Hank becomes more and more extravagant in his spending, betting on horse races, chartering private jets, and renovating his mansion. He even sponsors a daring albino-penguin expedition leading to Antarctica, which turns out to be a hoax concocted by Vincent. As the deadline approaches, Hank is dangerously close to failing his challenge; he still has around 2 million left to spend. Desperate, he organizes a city-wide scavenger hunt with the remaining money, offering that amount as the grand prize. Thousands of people participate in the event, and the entire city is involved in a mad frenzy. Along the way, Hank realizes he has fallen in love with Sarah, who reciprocates his feelings despite her initial reservations. Hank also discovers Vincent's deception and exposes him, protecting unsuspecting citizens from getting tangled in a web of fraud. In the final hours, Hank realizes that his material possessions and lavish lifestyle do not bring him true happiness. In the nick of time, the scavenger hunt's grand prize is claimed, and Hank fulfills the will's requirements. By truly understanding the true value of a dollar and the importance of strong relationships and morality, Hank wins the remaining inheritance. Upon receiving the rest of the fortune, Hank chooses to invest in the betterment of his small town, providing for a new hospital, a community center, and an education center for skill development. The film ends with Hank and Sarah announcing their engagement, and Mike— who had been offered a profitable position in Vincent's company— chooses loyalty and returns to working alongside Hank in the family mechanic shop. The three of them embody the lesson that the greatest wealth isn't money, but the love and friendships that surround them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bass player Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott, and drummer Mick Tucker. The group was originally called Sweetshop. The band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \\"Funny Funny\\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman. Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd & The Pirates.  The Sweet signed a new record contract with EMI's Parlophone label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \\"Lollipop Man\\" (September 1969), \\"All You'll Ever Get from Me\\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \\"Get on the Line\\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \\"Funny Funny\\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, \\"Think of You Baby\\" and \\"Do Unto Others\\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, Expansions on Life, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar.  The Sweet initially attempted to combine various musical influences, including the Monkees and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of the Hollies, with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the glam metal of a few years later.  The Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label Music for Pleasure as part of a compilation called Gimme Dat Ding, released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, \\"Gimme Dat Ding\\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were these well received?","output":"The three bubblegum pop singles, \\"Lollipop Man\\" (September 1969), \\"All You'll Ever Get from Me\\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \\"Get on the Line\\" (June 1970), were not well received, as they \\"failed to chart.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The concept was far more common in the early days of football, when pro teams used their best athletes as many ways as possible, and substitutions were far more restricted, meaning players had to stay on the field for offense, defense and \`\`special teams''. This was known as the one-platoon system. Available options: - no. - yes. Is this statement correct \\"can you play 2 positions in the nfl\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"can you play 2 positions in the NFL?\\" is correct. In the NFL and other levels of gridiron football, it is possible for players to play multiple positions. This is especially true for utility players, who have the skills and athletic ability to adapt to different roles on the field. Utility players are valuable assets to a team because of their versatility and ability to fill in at different positions when needed. The emergence of versatile players has continued to evolve since the early days of football when the one-platoon system was in place. During that period, players had to stay on the field for offense, defense, and special teams, forcing them to be proficient in more than one position. Although the NFL has largely moved away from the one-platoon system, there are still players in today's game who can be utilized in various positions. Some examples include: 1. Taysom Hill (New Orleans Saints) - Primarily a quarterback, Hill has also been utilized as a tight end, wide receiver, and special teams contributor. 2. Jabrill Peppers (New York Giants) - Drafted as a safety, Peppers has also played linebacker and served as a kick returner on special teams. 3. Ty Montgomery (New Orleans Saints) - Originally a wide receiver, Montgomery transitioned to running back and has also contributed on special teams as a kick returner. 4. Troy Brown (New England Patriots) - A wide receiver for most of his career, Brown stepped in as a defensive back during the Patriots' 2004 Super Bowl run and continued to play both positions throughout the remainder of his career. Some players may make position changes early in their careers and stick with their new roles permanently due to team needs or if their abilities are better suited to a different position. Others may switch between different roles on a game-by-game or even play-by-play basis, depending on game situations and coaching strategies. In summary, the statement \\"can you play 2 positions in the NFL?\\" is correct, as there are versatile utility players who have proven capable of playing multiple positions in the league. While less common than in the early days of football, athletes with the ability to fill various roles continue to greatly contribute to their teams' success by providing depth and flexibility."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Mike Pence emerges as Trump’s likely running mate CLEVELAND – Indiana Gov. Mike Pence emerged Thursday as Donald Trump’s likely running mate, with allies of Pence and Trump sending increasingly strong signals that Pence would join the GOP ticket and Republican leaders saying they have been told to stand by for an announcement. But less than 24 hours before Trump was set to reveal his vice-presidential choice at an event in New York, Trump had not made a formal offer, according Republicans familiar with the discussions who spoke mid-afternoon Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the ongoing talks were confidential. Indiana Governor Mike Pence (R) is on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's short list of potential vice presidential candidates. Here's what you need to know about him. (Peter Stevenson,Danielle Kunitz,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) The GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, traveling in California for a series of fundraisers, continued Thursday to solicit advice from his family and aides -- and held off, at least into the afternoon, on notifying Pence or any other potential pick of a decision, these Republicans said. In Indiana, meanwhile, Pence gave an economic speech and then waited with his family and advisers for word from Trump. Associates of Trump said he has been torn between his gut instincts to tap a fiery combatant or heeding the advice of his advisers to tap the relatively low-key and low-profile Pence, whose elevation to the ticket could help unify the divided Republican Party. Causing further hesitation was Trump's lack of a close personal bond with Pence, whom he has only gotten to know in recent months. Trump's adult children, as well as son-in-law Jared Kushner, have played an influential role guiding Trump's deliberations and gave him differing advice. Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's eldest son, and Kushner have advocated for former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), even though Trump's political advisers prefer Pence, according to people close to the family. Trump’s advisers cautioned on Thursday afternoon that the selection process remained fluid, and Republicans familiar with the celebrity mogul candidate's deliberations said that he could spring a surprise. Trump campaign officials, who are working here in Cleveland ahead of next week’s Republican National Convention, said reports that Trump has selected Pence were premature. They did not dispute that Pence would join the ticket, but said that no decision has been formalized. By mid-afternoon, two senior campaign officials said Trump had not yet called Pence to offer him the job or reached out to any other vice-presidential hopeful. A third official, spokesman Jason Miller, tweeted, \\"A decision has not been made by Mr. Trump.\\" 1/2 A decision has not been made by Mr. Trump. He will be making a decision in the future… — Jason Miller (@JasonMillerinDC) July 14, 2016 Trump is scheduled to make his first joint appearance with his running mate on Friday at the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan. Should he join forces with Trump, Pence, a deeply conservative former congressman and talk-radio host, could help him unite the disparate blocs within the Republican coalition — especially social conservatives and establishment leaders, who remain skeptical of if not outright hostile to Trump. A Republican official in touch with Pence's associates said Thursday morning that Pence told those associates he was convinced after his Wednesday meeting with Trump that he was going to be the pick. On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers reacted to the reports by showering praise on Pence but cautioned that they, too, had received no word on the selection from Trump or his campaign. \\"I'm happy for him and happy for the ticket,\\" said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who advises Trump on foreign policy and other issues. Although Corker added, \\"I don't know for real that this is it. … I'm surprised. I would have thought they'd be waiting until tomorrow — usually people wait until the last minute to make a decision. So that's why I'm a little cautious.\\" Pence, whose gubernatorial tenure has been marked by controversy over a state law seen as discriminatory against gays, would be a seasoned politician and conservative ideologue at Trump's side. He has not always agreed with Trump's policy ideas, however. Last December, for instance, Pence criticized Trump's controversial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. — Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015 On trade, Trump has campaigned as a strident protectionist, voicing opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership that was favored by most congressional Republicans and vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement as president. In September 2014, Pence tweeted in favor of the TPP: Trade means jobs, but trade also means security. The time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership — Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) September 8, 2014 And as a member of Congress, Pence voted for every free-trade agreement that he faced. Trump is known to value loyalty and those who have supported him from the beginning of his bid. Pence endorsed Trump's rival Ted Cruz shortly before the Indiana primary in May. While the endorsement was notably tepid and seemed designed not to offend Trump as little as possible, it was nonetheless time when they were clearly at odds with one another. With his comfortable victory in Indiana a few days later that endorsement, Trump effectively clinched the nomination -- knocking out his final two opponents: Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Trump has long said he wanted a running mate with governing experience who could help him enact his agenda in Washington. In addition to Pence, Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also were finalists. Both men spoke with Trump on Wednesday during the candidate’s stay in Indiana, following a Tuesday night rally with Pence. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), considered a long-shot candidate but one who has grown close to Trump, also visited with Trump in Indiana and traveled with him to California late Wednesday. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was another person considered by Trump in recent days. But all morning Thursday, there were signs that Pence had become Trump’s top choice. The governor convened an 8 a.m. meeting in Indianapolis with political allies to go over logistics should he join the ticket, Time magazine reported. Pence has until midday Friday to withdraw from his reelection campaign and remove himself from the Indiana ballot, something he would need to do if he were to run for vice president. [The Fix: 10 things you should know about Mike Pence] Also Thursday, Marc Lotter, Pence’s deputy campaign manager, was spotted by reporters on a flight from Indianapolis to New York, where Friday’s announcement will be made. The moves had Pence associates in Indiana abuzz about his likely selection. One of the governor’s top advisers and fundraisers said, “Most everybody in Indiana thinks it’s Pence.” #veepstakes mania watch 2 -- Marc Lotter, deputy campaign manager for @GovPenceIN on my flight from Indy to NYC. I'm sure just coincidence — Major Garrett (@MajorCBS) July 14, 2016 The selection of Pence would be a calculated overture to the party's wary right wing and to establishment leaders who have urged the candidate to tap a steady partner. The hope within Trump's orbit has been that he could win plaudits from powerful Republicans for going with someone they largely find acceptable — and that he could get a fresh look from general-election voters who have been eager for signs of seriousness from the combative businessman. Indeed, many GOP lawmakers praised Pence on Thursday. \\"Mike Pence has the legislative experience, having been in Congress and been a leader here,\\" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). \\"I think he'd be a good choice, but that doesn't mean the other guys aren't good choices, too.\\" Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) said picking Pence would be a wise choice by Trump, though he said he had not heard directly from the governor that he had been selected. \\"He makes the ticket better from day one,\\" Messner said. \\"I think it will be an important step towards bringing the entire coalition behind the Trump ticket.\\" But some more moderate Republican lawmakers said they were concerned Pence is too rigidly conservative to help Trump broaden his appeal to the general electorate. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), a Trump critic, said the selection of Pence is \\"not good enough for me\\" to change his mind about endorsing Trump. And Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said that despite Pence's good tone and temperament, he is too conservative on social issues. \\"If the objective is to broaden the appeal of the party beyond the base, I'm not sure this would be the wisest choice,\\" he said. In Pence, a 57-year-old evangelical Christian and father of three, Trump would have a vice-presidential nominee who is relatively little-known nationally but highly regarded by wealthy conservative donors such as the Koch brothers. Pence also provides a vivid contrast in style — with his full head of white hair, folksy demeanor and a smooth Midwestern voice that led him to be called \\"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\\" during his broadcasting years. Whereas Trump is known as a gregarious and fast-talking New Yorker, Pence speaks frequently about God and prayer and refers to his work as \\"servant leadership.\\" Pence often calls himself a \\"small-town kid who grew up with a cornfield in the back yard and dreaming of serving my country in public office.\\" Trump grew up the son of a businessman in New York who built a real-estate empire, attending military school and later the Ivy League. Sean Sullivan, Kelsey Snell, Karoun Demirjian, Amber Phillips and Jim Tankersley in Washington contributed to this story.

Japan's machinery orders are seen as a way of gauging capital spending for the next six to nine months. \\"Today's data on machinery orders suggest that capital spending will continue to expand this quarter,\\" said Japan economist Marcel Thieliant. \\"While a near-term slowdown is likely, we expect the recovery in capital expenditure to resume towards the end of this year,\\" he added. Meanwhile, Japan's central bank commences its two-day meeting later. Ahead of the meeting, the International Monetary Fund backed Japan's recent decision to introduce negative interest rates to spur growth. The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, said unconventional monetary policies should continue if they were accompanied by structural reforms and low inflation.

More on this story and other news from London Nibbs, who has prostate cancer, claimed he had acted in self defence and that he thought Ms Nibbs was a \\"snake\\" - but jurors heard he had shown no sign of mental illness. The Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC told him: \\"I'm sure you don't regret your wife's death save for its effect on your own comfort and well-being.\\" Defence lawyer Ian Henderson QC told the court that Nibbs acknowledged that his ill health meant he would die in jail. Nibbs attacked the mother of his two children after she had taunted him that she had had affairs. After knocking her unconscious with the iron bar, he then cut off her head before attacking it with a mallet. He then wrote a note to his son and called 999 to say two bodies would be found at the property. When police arrived, Nibbs was attempting to stab himself. Officers broke the door down before grappling with Nibbs who was armed with a shotgun and knife. Jurors heard that their relationship soured when he suspected Ms Nibbs of having affairs. Their son said that since his mother no longer had to care for his younger sister, Nibbs felt she had changed and was not the \\"housewife\\" she used to be. During a row Ms Nibbs admitted seeing other men, taunting her partner by saying: \\"I have had sex eight times.\\" The next day she inadvertently predicted her own killing as she left work with the words: \\"If I'm not in Friday, I might be dead.\\" Nibbs told the court that he had only meant to \\"slap her around a bit\\" and it was only after she was dead that he cut her head off in anger because she \\"betrayed\\" him.

Question: What is Borden's codeword? Movie title: The Prestige Movie plot: The Prestige begins with shots of several dozen top hats inexplicably strewn about in a forest.Cutter (Michael Caine), in voiceover, explains the three parts of a magic trick while performing a disappearing bird trick for a little girl. Part one is the pledge, where the magician shows you something ordinary, like a bird. Part two is the turn, where he does something extraordinary, like make the bird disappear. But this isn't enough. There always has to be a third act, the prestige, where you have a twist, and bring the bird back. Only then will the audience applaud.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), stage name \\"the Great Danton,\\" attempts a transporting trick that involves walking under a giant electrical machine with a Tesla coil and then disappearing through a trapdoor. Except that he falls straight into a giant tank of water that has been placed under the stage, and is automatically locked inside. A man in the audience, who we shortly learn is fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), stage name \\"the Professor,\\" forces his way beneath the stage in time to see Angier drown.After this introduction, we follow three timelines at once. In the present day (19th century England), Borden is on trial for murdering Angier, who we learn was his greatest rival. Cutter is revealed to be Angier's engineer, the man who builds the machinery for his tricks, and the little girl is Borden's daughter Jess (Samantha Mahurin).Cutter confides to the judge in a private meeting that the machine Angier was using wasn't built by him, but by \\"a wizard,\\" and it legitimately did what it appeared to do.The trial does not go well for Borden, and he faces execution. Later, in jail, Borden is approached by the solicitor for a collector, Lord Caldlow, who is interested in buying his secrets, particularly the secret of Borden's famous \\"Transported Man\\" trick.

This statement suggests an inability to participate or connect with something or someone, and often implies a sense of disappointment, frustration, or limitation.  To further analyze the sentiment, let's dive into the individual elements of the sentence: 1. \\"can not\\" - This phrase indicates impossibility or that something cannot happen. It sets a limiting tone to the sentence, which generally isn't viewed as pleasant or uplifting. 2. \\"engage\\" - The verb 'engage' speaks to the act of participating, interacting, or connecting with someone or something. In this context, it can relate to engaging with people, discussions, social or work activities, or general experiences.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Colorado beef company expands recall due to possible E. coli (CNN) -- A Colorado company's recall last week of beef products possibly contaminated with E. coli has been expanded, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said this week. The recall came as a result of \\"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states,\\" the USDA said. The initial recall of 41,280 pounds announced last Wednesday was voluntarily expanded Sunday to include an additional 380,000 pounds of products made by the JBS Swift Beef Company, of Greeley, Colorado, the USDA said. The recall came as a result of \\"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states, of which at least 18 appear to be associated,\\" the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a written statement. USDA spokesman Brian Mabry said no fatalities had been reported. On its Web site, the company said the suspect beef was produced at its Greeley plant on April 21 and distributed nationally and internationally. \\"Each of our customers will be personally informed of this recall by phone,\\" the wholesaler said. A spokesman would not identify those customers to CNN. \\"That's ridiculous!\\" said Sarah Klein, a staff attorney for the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. \\"JBS should be able to say who they sold meat to, and those companies should be able to say, 'These are the products we created from them.' \\" She expressed concern that nearly seven months into the Obama administration, a key undersecretary position at the USDA has not been filled, which may be slowing the government's ability to respond to such health threats. \\"That person in that position would have significant public health experience and understand how these processes work, how meat enters the chain of commerce,\\" Klein said. The recall underscores the need for \\"a comprehensive animal identification system\\" that would allow meat suppliers to trace their products to an individual ranch, she said. Klein urged supermarkets that use customer loyalty cards to track shoppers' purchases to determine those who have bought the recalled meat. Boxes of the recalled product bear the establishment number \\"EST. 969\\" inside the USDA mark of inspection, the identifying package date of \\"042109\\" and a time stamp ranging from \\"0618\\" to \\"1130,\\" the statement said. It added that some of the beef products might have undergone further processing and might not have the \\"EST. 969\\" marking on products for sale directly to consumers. The USDA urged any customers with concerns to contact the store where they bought the meat. JBS spokesman Chandler Keys said his company's products may have had nothing to do with the outbreak. \\"It is important for consumers to note that the recalled product from the date in question was sold by JBS as whole muscle cuts, not as ground beef,\\" Keys said on the company's Web site. \\"The ground beef that might have been associated with illness was produced by other companies who often do not use the antimicrobial intervention steps we employ in our facility to reduce the risk of the beef products.\\" He said JBS agreed to expand its recall \\"out of an abundance of caution for consumers.\\" Symptoms of infection with E. coli bacteria can include severe or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal cramping. The USDA urged consumers to cook all ground beef or ground beef patties to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit to kill any bacteria. CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.

Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics.

It does not, however, explicitly state whether or not all buildings can be visited within the 40-minute timeframe. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis directly. While the premise states that the tours are 40 minutes long, it does not provide specific information about the number of buildings to visit or the necessary time for each. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude if it is possible to visit all buildings within the 40-minute tour based solely on the premise."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception  of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. When asked to find the larger circle,  _  . A) children at 6 got it wrong 79 % of the time with no gray ones around B) only adults over 18 got it right 95% of the time with gray ones around C) children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around D) adults got it right most of the time with gray ones around Answer:","output":"C) children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The infection cleared up after adding alcohol rather than cider, because in this case, the","output":"alcohol was a more effective disinfectant and antiseptic agent, which facilitated the healing process and prevented the possibility of further complications. The alcohol, specifically ethanol or isopropanol, possesses antimicrobial properties that are ideal for eliminating a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Cider, although it does contain some alcohol content, is usually not potent enough to have a significant impact on disinfection. Additionally, cider contains sugars and other organic compounds that might support the growth of microbes, counteracting any potential benefits that its alcohol content might offer. This is why, in this case, alcohol was deemed a better choice compared to cider. The use of alcohol as an antiseptic can be traced back centuries to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Its germ-killing properties have been widely accepted and documented in various cultures, especially for surface disinfection and wound cleansing. When applied to minor cuts, scrapes, or infections, alcohol destroys or inhibits the growth of microorganisms, thus reducing the risk of infection. It breaks down the outer cell membrane, causing vital proteins within the microbes to become denatured or lose their functional capacity—one of the primary reasons why alcohol is so effective. However, it is also essential to ensure that the alcohol concentration is suitable for disinfection. A concentration between 60% and 90% is considered most effective, as it permeates the cells of the microorganisms, causing irreversible damage. If the concentration is below this range, alcohol may not be effective enough, while exceeding the recommended range might cause the proteins to coagulate too rapidly, potentially forming a barrier that could protect the microbes from further damage. While alcohol proved to be efficient in clearing up the infection in this case, it is worth noting that it should be used with caution and only for certain types of infections and minor wounds. Alcohol has a drying effect on the skin and can cause considerable discomfort or irritation—especially for those with sensitive skin. Moreover, it is not recommended for deep wounds or punctures, where it could potentially delay the healing process. In conclusion, the infection cleared up after adding alcohol rather than cider because, in this case, the alcohol was more suitable for disinfection and preventing the growth of harmful pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of alcohol helped to speed up the healing process, resulting in a faster recovery and ultimately reducing the risk of complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there could be multiple factors contributing to their sleeplessness, and the available options do not necessarily cover all potential reasons. Therefore, I will analyze the provided options and present a detailed explanation: I. They had been having problems falling asleep: This reason seems to be the most plausible as the individual mentioned they \\"did n't sleep one wink\\" and have not slept well for two nights this week. Insomnia, which refers to the difficulty in falling or staying asleep, could be the primary issue in this case. Insomnia can be caused by various factors including stress, anxiety, poor sleep hygiene, or an underlying medical condition. Examining and addressing the causes of their insomnia might help the individual improve their sleep quality. II. They had to stay up all night for school: While it is possible that school-related responsibilities might be contributing to their sleeplessness, the information provided does not directly mention any connection with school. Therefore, this option might not be the most accurate reason for their lack of sleep. III. None of the above choices: This option implies that there could be other factors not mentioned in the available choices that are causing the individual to experience sleeplessness. It is important to consider this possibility as various external and internal influences might be affecting their sleep quality. For instance, environmental factors like noise or temperature, consumption of stimulants such caffeine or nicotine, or emotional stressors could be contributing to their sleep disturbances. IV. They had to stay up late for their job: Similar to option II, the information provided does not directly mention any correlation between their job and their sleeplessness.

Which farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds?  Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.  Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Would \\"Normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Your resting heart rate (RHR) is the number of times your heart beats per minute (bpm) while you are at complete rest. It is highly individual and can be affected by factors such as fitness level, age, and overall health. While the normal resting heart rate for adults, including 24-year-olds, generally falls within the range of 60-100 bpm, this is a wide range and might not accurately represent your specific resting heart rate. A more specific classification is that a well-trained athlete typically has a lower RHR, between 40 and 60 bpm, while a sedentary person might have an RHR toward the higher end of the normal range. It is essential to note that a \\"normal\\" resting heart rate is subjective and varies from person to person. To determine your personal resting heart rate, you can measure it manually by counting your pulse or using a heart rate monitor. Ideally, measure it in a relaxed state, such as first thing in the morning before getting out of bed. It is also suggested to measure it over a few days and calculate the average to get a more accurate representation.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Q:-  These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process is the establishment of pioneer species in the area, which can help gradually transform an uninhabited or disturbed environment into a thriving ecosystem. Pioneer species are hardy, adaptable organisms, typically fast-growing plants, lichens, or mosses, that can efficiently colonize an area with extreme conditions or poor soils. In the context of the process described, the pioneer species, often small plants or ground-covering vegetation, could establish itself on barren or disrupted land where other plants may struggle to survive. This could be due to factors such as soil erosion, lack of moisture, or even post-forest fires and other natural disasters. These plants are well-adapted to surviving in harsh conditions, and they often have efficient mechanisms for reproducing, dispersing seeds, and growing rapidly. These pioneer species play a critical role in initiating the process of ecological succession, which eventually leads to the formation of a stable, biodiverse ecosystem, including the growth of trees. As the pioneer plants grow, mature, and die, they contribute organic material to the soil through decomposition, enriching the nutrient content and ultimately improving the fertility of the soil. This accumulation of organic matter also aids in the retention of moisture, which helps support a diverse range of life forms in the area. With the soil becoming more fertile over time, larger and more complex plants can establish themselves and outcompete the pioneer species. These new and typically slower-growing species continue to contribute to the overall improvement of the soil, with their deeper root systems helping to stabilize and structure the soil particles. This progression of plant life also provides habitats and resources for various animal species, which in turn helps to create a more intricate and well-balanced ecosystem. As larger plants continue to grow, taller and more robust species such as shrubs and young trees begin to emerge. These trees eventually create a microclimate and protective canopy, which helps to further conserve soil moisture and shield the undergrowth, fostering the development of even more diverse plant and animal species. Over several decades to centuries of ecological succession, the area evolves into a stable, thriving, and self-sufficient forest ecosystem, supporting a vast array of species, both flora and fauna. In conclusion, the first step of the process described is the establishment of pioneer species in the area. These initial-stage organisms not only take advantage of otherwise inhospitable habitats but also lay the foundation for the ongoing development and maturation of an ecosystem through the contributions of organic material, improving soil fertility, and supporting the growth of larger, more complex plants and, eventually, trees."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following context:  The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\".  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.  answer the following question:  What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art?","output":"The Catacombs of Rome serve as a vital source for understanding the emergence of Christian iconography, initially from Roman popular decorative art. The early Christian art found within the catacombs, primarily in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi, display a gradual development of distinct Christian symbolism and artistic representations. In the beginning, early Christians refrained from creating iconic images of religious figures, primarily due to their persecution and the need for discretion in their religious practices. Instead, they focused on decorating sarcophagi with diverse motifs, ornaments and Christian symbols. A significant example of this is the use of the Chi Rho monogram, which stands for the first two letters of the Greek word for 'Christ' and is one of the earliest forms of christogram. As time progressed and the Christian community evolved, their art began to borrow elements from official imperial and pagan motifs, integrating these influences to develop a unique and distinguishing Christian iconography. This shift is visible in the narrative religious scenes depicted in the frescoes and sarcophagi found within the catacombs, which showcased biblical stories and the lives of saints. Furthermore, the early Christians' practice of building churches, such as the famous St. Peter's in Rome, over the burial sites of martyrs contributed to the emergence of a distinct Christian funerary art style. This resulted in the creation of church monuments and tombs inside sacred spaces, differentiating them from other cultures such as Judaism, Hinduism, and classical paganism that considered the dead ritually impure and avoided the mixture of temples and cemeteries. In summary, the Catacombs of Rome are an essential testament to the emergence of Christian iconography from the initially Roman popular decorative art. The progression from simple symbolic decorations to the adoption of imperial and pagan elements, combined with the unique practices of honoring martyrs and incorporating religious art into sacred spaces, showcases the development of a rich and identifiable Christian artistic tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer this question: where was the first transatlantic phone call made?","output":"The first transatlantic phone call was made on January 7, 1927, between New York City, USA, and London, United Kingdom. This groundbreaking call was a collaboration between American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and the British General Post Office. The technology at the forefront of this historical event was the Bell System's development of long-range telephony. The first transmission of sound across the Atlantic Ocean was done through radio waves in 1915, and it set the stage for future innovations in communication. The first successful commercial transatlantic telephone service between the United States and the United Kingdom, however, relied on undersea telegraph cables, a significant upgrade from radio-based communication. In order to make this first transatlantic phone call possible, several critical components had to be put into place. The most crucial element was the development of the proper infrastructure to support long-range telecommunication. This involved laying approximately 2,225 miles of undersea telegraph cable from Bell System's station at Horta, in the Azores, to the General Post Office's station located at Ballantrae, Scotland. Additional cables continued from Scotland to Hayes in the outskirts of London. This complex network of cables enabled a stable connection across the Atlantic Ocean. The call itself was conducted in two stages. The first stage of the call involved an exchange of conversations between the AT&T's president, Walter S. Gifford, in New York and Sir Evelyn P. Murray, who was the secretary of the General Post Office in London. The conversation marked the beginning of the transatlantic telephone service, with Gifford expressing his excitement about the impact of the new technology. While the technology of their time produced a slight delay in call response, the quality of the connection was remarkable for its time. The second stage of the call involved renowned figures, with American inventor and industrialist Thomas A. Watson in San Francisco, speaking to Sir Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio telegraph system, in Genoa, Italy. The success of the call was hailed as a significant milestone in breaking barriers for global communication. This first transatlantic phone call opened up new possibilities and expanded communication networks around the world. The event's success paved the way for future advancements in telecommunications, leading to the development of modern communication methods such as satellite telephony and fiber optic connections. Today, we can stay connected to people across vast distances with relative ease, thanks to the ambitious strides made by visionaries during those formative years in global telecommunication history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Dwingeloo 1 is a barred spiral galaxy about 10 million light-years away from the Earth, in the constellation Cassiopeia. It lies in the Zone of Avoidance and is heavily obscured by the Milky Way. The size and mass of Dwingeloo 1 are comparable to those of Triangulum Galaxy.  - Dwingeloo 2 is a small irregular galaxy discovered in 1996 and located about 10 million light - years away from the Earth . Its discovery was a result of Dwingeloo Obscured Galaxy Survey ( DOGS ) of the Zone of Avoidance . Dwingeloo 2 is a companion galaxy of Dwingeloo 1 . Dwingeloo 2 was first detected at radio wavelengths from the 21 cm emission line of neutral atomic hydrogen ( known to astronomers as HI ) in the course of follow - up observations after the discovery of Dwingeloo 1 . Dwingeloo 2 is thought to be a member of the IC 342/Maffei Group , a galaxy group adjacent to the Local Group . The galaxy recedes from the Milky Way at the speed of about 241 km / s. The visible radius of Dwingeloo 2 is approximately 2  , which at the distance of 3 Mpc corresponds to about 2 kpc . Dwingeloo 2 has a well defined rotating HI disk inclined at approximately 69 ° with respect to observer . The distribution of the neutral hydrogen in Dwingeloo 2 is quite irregular , and it is detected as far as 3.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy . The total mass of the galaxy within this radius is estimated at 2.3 billion Solar masses , while the mass of the neutral hydrogen is estimated at about 100 million Solar masses . The total mass of the galaxy is about five times less than that of Dwingeloo 1 . The irregular structure of Dwingeloo 2 is likely related to its interaction with the much larger nearby galaxy Dwingeloo 1 , which lies at a distance of only 24 kpc from Dwingeloo 2 .  - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.  - An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a spiral or an elliptical galaxy. Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular classes of the Hubble sequence, and they are often chaotic in appearance, with neither a nuclear bulge nor any trace of spiral arm structure.  - The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 3 million light-years (ly) from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is catalogued as Messier 33 or NGC 598, and is sometimes informally referred to as the Pinwheel Galaxy, a nickname it shares with Messier 101.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land.  - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire.  - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back .

It extends from Strathmore in the east, to the Pass of Drumochter in the north, Rannoch Moor and Ben Lui in the west, and Aberfoyle in the south. It was a local government county from 1890 to 1930.  - Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne. It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain.  - The Pass of Drumochter is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass.  - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.  - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn.  - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write highlights for this article: Books, movies, magazines and newspapers repeatedly refer to addiction, usually concerning drugs or alcohol. It is only recently, in the modern realm of celebrity addictions that the public discourse has added sex to the list of potential afflictions (see: Tiger Woods, David Duchovny) and the general public is still rather slow on acceptance. How can something as fun as sex be an addiction, you ask? The answer is, any addiction is potentially destructive, turning something enjoyable, like a pint of beer or an intimate evening into something entirely different. Feeling compelled can take the joy out of anything. \\"Shame,\\" the excellent and profoundly disturbing sophomore film (following 2008's highly-regarded \\"Hunger\\") from English director Steve McQueen, is basically a character study of two damaged souls and their relationships both with each other and the world around them. It's a penetrating and deeply unsettling look at addiction, obsession and self-destruction. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is an upwardly-mobile, thirtysomething New Yorker who just happens to spend every waking moment that he's not otherwise occupied with work, engaged in some sort of sexual activity. Pornography, escorts, random encounters, group sex, masturbation ... all are fair game. He is an addict by any definition of the word and lest you consider sex addiction as a comparatively harmless addiction compared with, say, drugs or alcohol, think again. It's as if he's constantly in pain and sex is the only way to stop the agony, to shut his emotional life away in a box. It's routine self-numbing, and however charming or chatty Brandon may be in public, it's all just a means to an end -- the search for sexual release. Maintaining a tenuous balancing act between his work life and his life as an addict, Brandon is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged younger sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). The two have a past. Something has happened in their childhood that has shaped their lives and their relationship and each has dealt with it in a different way. While we might be able to read into their behavior somewhat, we are largely left to imagine what that past might contain. While Brandon has buried his emotions in sexual release, Sissy is the opposite and wears hers on her sleeve, along with scars from a past of cutting and perhaps, suicide attempts. She is all externalized emotions, a gadabout to Brandon's stoic. She's a nightclub performer and extrovert, the exact opposite of her brother's bottled-up persona, and her visit upsets his apple cart completely. In this oil-and-water sibling relationship, all he wants is for her to take life seriously and exhibit some responsibility, while she's trying to get him to loosen up and have some fun. It seems as though neither is capable of doing what the other wants and both are eminently self-destructive. He is used to his solo sex life: He has an extensive porn collection, uses escorts frequently and visits Internet sex sites, all of which are interrupted by Sissy's visit. She has no idea of his addiction and when she stumbles onto it, things go pear-shaped, but fast. Fassbender's performance is not entirely unlike the one he gives in David Cronenberg's \\"A Dangerous Method\\" in that much of his character's emotional life goes on beneath the surface. However, in \\"Shame\\" it's reversed. While his portrayal of Carl Jung in the Cronenberg film came alive when he was with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), Brandon shuts down when he's in sexual situations and the only person who can coax an emotion out of him is Sissy -- and that emotion usually is anger. Sissy, on the other hand, is just looking for some love, caring and protection from her big brother. It's clear the two don't see each other very often, otherwise she'd know that Brandon is the last person to go to for those things and the last to understand what she needs. Carey Mulligan more than holds her own against yet another impressive 2011 performance from Fassbender, giving one of the best female performances in a year rife with them. A decent shot at a best supporting actress Oscar nomination, her Sissy is an open wound, raw and emotionally unguarded and working without a safety net. For his part, Fassbender inhabits Brandon like a less-homicidal version of Patrick Bateman (\\"American Psycho\\"). Cool, calm and collected, his emotions buried ... until they aren't and they leap out of him in a torrent. Like any addict, he's forever searching for something to soothe his pain. The third major character in \\"Shame\\" is New York City, and McQueen shows its cold, bleak and rather lonely side. If you've lived there for any length of time, you ought to understand: For such a large and vibrant city, it can make you feel like you're the last person on earth. McQueen uses the subways and dark, outer borough streets, bars and clubs to great effect, leaving most of the city (and most of its occupants) outside a tight frame and out of focus. No sweeping, glorious views of the skyline, but rather tight shots of Brandon on the subway or in a club. Even many of the sex scenes are shot as a collection of limbs and faces and breasts and other various body parts so you often aren't exactly sure where one person ends and another begins. As for said sex scenes, they are anything but sexy. By the time the most graphic of Brandon's encounters occurs, arousal doesn't even enter the mind. Much how \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" was unlikely to cause most people to reach for a vodka on the rocks, \\"Shame\\" is not going to be the cause for much late-night pillow talk. On the other hand, it may just make you reach for that drink. \\"Shame\\" is rated NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted). There's a lot of graphic sex, all sorts of nudity and the subject matter is pretty damn dark.

In court, Mr West senior's personal assistant compared working for the older man to being part of a \\"dysfunctional family\\". Mr West junior admits the killing, but denies murder by reason of loss of control. The Old Bailey heard the pair had a turbulent relationship and Mr West Sr sacked his son the day he was killed. Following an argument, Mr West Jr was said to have drunk several glasses of whisky before taking a large knife from his flat and going to his father's house on 12 December last year. Mr West Sr's personal assistant, Oksana Stanzione, told the Old Bailey shouting and swearing was a \\"way of life\\" and while the son would usually walk away from arguments, on the day of the killing the \\"floodgates opened\\". Recalling the argument in the bar of Abracadabra, one of a string of West End nightspots owned by the family, Ms Stanzione said: \\"He [Mr West Jr] said 'I wish you were dead, I hate you. You are a horrible, horrible man and I think if you died it would do a lot of people a favour. I don't want to work for you any more'. \\"There was a lot of swearing.\\" She said Mr West Jr believed his father was wasting money which should have been his inheritance. The court was shown CCTV footage from inside the restaurant which showed the defendant throwing a bar stool as the argument became more heated. The court heard that after the row, Ms Stanzione helped Mr West Sr back back to his house where he collapsed drunk at the bottom of the stairs. His son is alleged to have then let himself in and stabbed him twice with a kitchen knife - once in the neck and chest - before returning to the restaurant bar to dial 999. The case continues.

Kiraly had a long career on the professional beach circuit, and with 148 career wins is the 'winningest' player in the sport's history. He won at least one tournament in 24 of the 28 seasons he played in a career that spanned four decades. He claimed titles with 13 partners, and in domestic events he made it to the semifinals over 80% of the time. Kiraly competed into his mid-40s.  Kiraly played in his first beach tournament at age 11 as his father's partner. Kiraly has said as an 11-year-old he was thrilled to discover in beach volleyball he could compete with grown men on even terms. He earned his A and AA rating on the beach at the age of 15 and his AAA rating at 17. Kiraly's first big beach breakthrough came at Hermosa Beach in 1978. As a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school, he shocked Hermosa onlookers by gaining the finals before he and partner Marco Ortega lost to the day's dominant team on the beach, Jim Menges and Greg Lee. In the early 1980s, Kiraly made a successful beach team pairing with UCLA teammate Sinjin Smith. The partnership split up as Kiraly came to focus on the U.S National Team.  In 1992 Kiraly left his indoor career behind, returning to the U.S. to play beach volleyball full-time on the AVP tour. Kiraly chose Kent Steffes as his doubles partner. Steffes was a talented younger player who had left UCLA early to start playing on the professional beach tour. Kiraly and Steffes soon became the dominant pairing on the tour, supplanting former teammate and doubles partner Smith and his partner Randy Stoklos as the beach's top team. In 1996 Kiraly returned to the Olympics, this time competing in beach volleyball with his partner, Steffes. Kiraly and Steffes won the gold medal, the first ever awarded for men's beach volleyball.  Kiraly continued to win tournaments into his 40s, recording two AVP tournament victories with his partner Brent Doble in 2002 and 2003, and four more with Mike Lambert in 2004 and 2005. Kiraly's last victory came in August 2005, when he and Lambert won at Huntington Beach. In 2006, Kiraly partnered with Larry Witt, and in 2007 partnered with Kevin Wong. His teams continued to make high placings. Over his career on the beach, Kiraly won over 3 million in prize money, and earned considerably more in endorsements. Kiraly retired from the AVP tour after the 2007 season.  Ultimately Kiraly won 148 professional beach volleyball titles, 74 of them with Steffes. The next closest player in total wins is Sinjin Smith at 139. Following Smith is his longtime partner, Randy Stoklos, at 122. The next closest player behind these four from the top two teams is Emanuel Rego, with 78 wins.

Answer:","output":"The cell division process responsible for the formation of gametes is called meiosis. Gametes are the sex cells, specifically sperm and eggs, which are necessary for sexual reproduction. Meiosis is a specialized cell division process that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms, resulting in the production of gametes with half the number of chromosomes compared to the parent cell. This reduction in chromosome number is essential to maintain the correct number of chromosomes in the offspring after fertilization. Meiosis consists of two consecutive cell divisions, called Meiosis I and Meiosis II, each of which can be further divided into multiple stages: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase. Meiosis I (The Reductional Division): 1. Prophase I: Chromosomes condense, and homologous chromosomes (chromosomes with the same genes, one from each parent) pair up, forming a structure called a bivalent or a tetrad. During this stage, a process called crossing over (or recombination) occurs, in which sections of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chromatids, increasing genetic diversity. The nuclear envelope also breaks down, and spindle fibers begin to form. 2. Metaphase I: The paired homologous chromosomes align at the middle of the cell (equatorial plate), with the spindle fibers attaching to the centromeres, which are specialized regions on the chromosomes. 3. Anaphase I: Spindle fibers pull the homologous chromosomes apart towards opposite poles of the cell. This is a crucial distinction from mitosis, where sister chromatids separate instead. 4. Telophase I: The chromosomes reach their respective poles, and a new nuclear envelope starts to form. The cell then undergoes cytokinesis, separating the cytoplasm, resulting in the formation of two daughter cells. Meiosis II (The Equational Division): 5. Prophase II: The nuclear envelope breaks down, and chromosomes condense again. Spindle fibers form anew in each of the two daughter cells from Meiosis I. 6. Metaphase II: The chromosomes align at the equatorial plate, with spindle fibers attaching to the chromatids' centromeres. 7. Anaphase II: Spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart and move them toward opposite poles of the cell. 8. Telophase II: The chromatids (now known as chromosomes) reach their respective poles, and the nuclear envelope reforms. Cytokinesis occurs, resulting in four haploid cells (cells with half the number of chromosomes). These cells will mature into gametes: sperm in males and eggs in females. It is essential to understand that meiosis is a crucial process in sexually reproducing organisms, as it helps maintain the correct chromosome number, increases genetic diversity through crossing over, and ultimately contributes to the survival and evolution of the species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Review 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' - Ben Stiller's Dream of Life I should almost disqualify myself from reviewing The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The main character, played by Ben Stiller, works in midtown Manhattan’s Time + Life Building, my business home for 33 years. He is employed by a weekly Time Inc. news publication — Life, not TIME — which is about to be taken over and downsized; Time Inc. is to be spun off from its parent corporation, Time Warner, some time next year. Mitty’s job, now threatened, is to manage and care for the photographs of that great old publication; Mary Corliss ran the Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive for 34 years, and in 2002 she was abruptly let go, and that invaluable archive shuttered, after a four-and-a-half-month strike in which Mary played an important role. For my wife and me, watching this movie was like sitting through our surprise dual biography, so many of its images triggering memories of poignancy or pleasure. (READ: Mary and the Case of the Missing Film Stills) Mitty, directed by Stiller from Steve Conrad’s script, still could’ve stunk; and it has its occasional longueurs. But even people not named Corliss, people not involved in the endangered crafts of print journalism and photo curating, should be able to connect with the movie’s sweet and mournful tone. Anthony Lane, reviewing the film in The New Yorker, said it “keeps glancing backward, at the lost and the obsolete.” Exactly, and in a good way: Mitty pays tribute to people who cherish the past and, in the face of extinction, are devoted to preserving it. Beyond that, Mitty is a lovely romantic comedy — the portrait of a man, nearly swallowed by the gulf between the world his lives in and the world he dreams of, who manages to bridge the two and to find Ms. Right in the workplace he cherishes. The movie takes its title and little else from James Thurber‘s 2,079-word story published in The New Yorker 75 years ago next March. Thurber’s Mitty is a henpecked husband driving his wife to her weekly hair date in Waterbury, Conn. As his wife or a garage mechanic berates him, Mitty slips into five fantasy roles: a Navy Captain, a genius surgeon, a master criminal, a pilot on a suicide mission and, finally, a hero facing a firing squad. So meager and hopeless is Mitty’s life that his last daydream is of violent death. (READ: James Thurber’s story “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”) The 1947 movie musical, starring Danny Kaye, took a half-step toward the new film. Mitty works as an editor of pulp-fiction magazines, whose lurid tales fuel his reveries; and a mysterious woman leads him into real-life exploits more extravagant than his wildest woolgatherings. Stiller’s Mitty also goes on adventures, though of his own choosing: to find the photograph that will be on the cover of Life’s final print edition. The expiring magazine is Walter’s secret Life. At the start, though, he is just a schlub with a furtive crush on his new Life colleague Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). Logging on to eHarmony.com, he cannot even “wink” at Cheryl; the technology defeats him. Waiting for the train to take him downtown to work, Walter imagines a tenement building bursting into flames; like Superman, he vaults from the platform into the building to save Cheryl’s three-legged dog — and presents her with a furry prosthesis for the pet’s missing limb. At work, he materializes as a Spanish stud in a snow storm, wooing Cheryl with soothing words and a “poetry falcon”; and he sees himself as Benjamin Button, an infant with an old man’s face, cradled and nurtured by Cheryl. Unfortunately for Walter, he also fantasizes talking sass to Ted (Adam Scott), the slimy, bearded, three-piece-suited dude whose job is to turn Life from a magazine to a digital domain in the speediest, most contemptible way possible. Ted thinks Walter, petrified in his dreams, is an idiot who is withholding that last cover picture, taken by revered photographer Sean O’Connell (Sean Penn). In fact, the negative is missing, and locating it becomes Walter’s mission. He and the audience must follow three pictorial clues left by Sean; they lead Walter to Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas and back home. (READ: a review of the 1947 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by subscribing to TIME) The Stiller and Kaye films twisted Thurber’s thesis: that modern man seeks freedom in dreams from nagging reality but can never escape. Serious fiction, including serious humorous fiction, paints the cage that imprisons humanity. Movies, in the 1940s or today, unlock the cell door; the screen is a wall showing the rich life that society may deny us. Stiller’s Mitty lives in that dream world. Early in the film, Walter may have little hope; yet he and Cheryl are destined to come together, if only because they have eyes of a magical blue — movie-star eyes. And when he goes on his world tour, this little man in a sedentary job turns out to be an expert bicyclist, runner and skateboarder. The movie has a lot of Walter exercising. In development for nearly 20 years, the Mitty project was at one time or another to have starred Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson, Mike Myers or Sacha Baron Cohen, and to have been directed by Ron Howard, Chuck Russell, Steven Spielberg, Gore Verbinski or Mark Waters. The final script by Conrad, who had written The Weather Man for Verbinski, became Stiller’s fifth feature film as director, after Reality Bites, The Cable Guy, the great Zoolander and Tropic Thunder. (SEE: Derek Zoolander on one of the Top 10 fake TIME magazine covers) An auteur with an acute visual touch, Stiller fills the wide screen artfully and playfully. In one shot, our attention is directed to Walter in the rear of the frame: he’s a blur, even as his own undeveloped life is a picture that has not yet come into focus. The cue for Walter’s daydreams is often a subtle shift into a sharp, old-fashioned Kodachrome color. Later, on his intercontinental journey, he sees a flock of birds that assemble Cheryl’s face in the sky. As he treks the Himalayas, his words — “Now at 18,000 feet my mind drifts like the snow” — are scrawled across the screen like an entry in an adventurer’s diary. Stiller also extracts appealing performances from the supporting cast: Shirley MacLaine as Walter’s mother, Patton Oswalt as his eHarmony contact, Adrian Martinez as his dark-room assistant and especially Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as a drunken bear of a helicopter pilot. The most romantic notion held by this very dreamy film is the value of an important job done well. Roaming corridors filled with giant reproductions of old Life covers, Walter is haunted by Henry Luce’s mission statement in the first issue of Life, synopsized here as: “To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of Life.” And of Walter’s life, whether he is jumping from a helicopter into a turbulent sea infested with sharks or sitting in his photo archive trying to make a phantom picture come into focus. (READ: What would Henry Luce make of the digital age?) The Secret Life of Walter Mitty proclaims that the past is worth treasuring, every bit as much as the fantasy future. Like Walter — and two people named Corliss — this touching movie elegy believes not just in the wonder of what might be but in the glory of what was.","output":"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a film directed by Ben Stiller, who also plays the main character.

It just becomes unenforceable, that’s the problem the","output":"BBC is facing. With the rise of digital streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, consumers are increasingly shifting away from traditional television and towards on-demand content. For the first time, the number of UK households equipped with a television has reported a decline. This behavioural shift is disrupting the established television industry, posing serious concerns for institutions such as the BBC that rely on television licensing fees for revenue. Traditionally, the BBC has obtained its primary funding from the licence fee paid by UK residents. This unique funding model enables the media organisation to produce diverse content, from radio programs to television dramas, news, and documentaries, being free from commercial pressure and political influence. Now, as more and more viewers switch to digital platforms to watch their favourite programmes on computers, tablets, smartphones, it makes the enforcement of the license fee much trickier. Moreover, a growing number of people question the need to pay a license fee for a service they perceive as less and less relevant. Members of Parliament have taken note of this shift, and are proposing that the funding model for the BBC be reevaluated given these changes. Many suggest that the new data “undermines the case for the licence fee”, as viewers now have access to their favourite programmes through online catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and 4OD. Shows like Strictly Come Dancing, X Factor, and Gogglebox can be watched at leisure, free from schedule constraints, and often free of charge, making the traditional television model increasingly obsolete. A switch to a subscription-based model for BBC might be one solution. This would mean replacing the license fee with a monthly or yearly subscription fee akin to how services like Netflix or Amazon Prime operate. This would allow viewers to pay for the content they wish to watch. However, the impacts such a change could have on the BBC and wider broadcasting landscape would be considerable. The corporation may have to start producing more commercially viable content to draw and retain subscribers, possibly impacting the diversity and quality of the content. Some less popular but culturally important shows might be at risk of being axed if they fail to attract sufficient viewership.  In short, the decline in the number of UK households possessing a television presents more than just a challenge to the traditional broadcast industry, it signifies a revolutionary shift in how media is consumed. It also raises urgent questions about how public broadcasting services like the BBC should be financed in a rapidly changing digital era. This will likely continue to be a topic of hot debate among law- and decision-makers, the broadcasting industry, and the viewing public, as we navigate this new digital landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You have to determine whether the Head is used for the Tail or not. The usage describes everyday affordances or uses of objects and includes both typical and atypical uses. For example, a popcorn bucket can typically be used to hold popcorn, but it could also serve as a hat in atypical situations. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Input: Head: PersonX begins to hurt<sep>Tail: sad Output:","output":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Your task is to determine if the Head is used for the Tail. The Head and Tail contain everyday situations or uses involving participants such as PersonX, PersonY, or PersonZ. An example includes a popcorn bucket typically holding popcorn or being used as a hat. You need to classify your answers as either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". The phrase may also have a placeholder \\"___\\" representing objects, people, or actions. Now, let's solve this task: Input: Head: PersonX begins to hurt<sep>Tail: sad Step 1: Identify the Head and the Tail phrases. Head: PersonX begins to hurt Tail: sad Step 2: Determine if the Head is used for the Tail. In this case, when PersonX begins to hurt, it can lead to PersonX or others feeling sad. Step 3: Classify the answer as either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Since the Head event may lead to the Tail event (sadness), the answer is: Output: Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The truth about girls and boys, toys and TV Uh-oh. Here comes more bad news for the “gender is a social construct” crowd. A new study by researchers at the City University of London found that babies as young as 9 months old prefer to play with toys specific to their own gender. The experimenters, whose results were published in the journal Infant and Child Development this month, put 101 girls and boys between the ages of 9 and 32 months in a nursery with a variety of toys and observed which ones the children seemed to play with more. The toys used in the study were a doll, a pink teddy bear, a cooking pot, a car, a blue teddy, a digger and a ball. Toys were placed a few feet from the children so they would have to make some effort to get to them, and then researchers observed not only which ones they chose, but also how they played with them and for how long. Among the youngest, they found, the boys tended to prefer the ball and the girls wanted the pot. While modern parents like to think that everything is in our control when it comes to socializing children, the researchers found the opposite to be true. They write: “Our findings of sex differences in toy choice in the 9 to 17 months age group add some weight to the suggestion that such preferences appear prior to extensive socialization and do not depend on gender category knowledge but are reflections of our biological heritage.” A recent photo series from a project called #ABoyCanToo has been going around on social media. It includes portraits of boys who pursue interests traditionally associated with girls. A Huffington Post article, “13 Empowering Photos Show There’s No ‘Right’ Way to Be a Boy,” says the pictures are “shining a light on kids who don’t let gender norms prevent them from following their dreams.” There’s a picture of a boy in a frilly lace dress and one dancing ballet and another with bows in his hair. But it’s not gender norms that are the biggest force at work here. Rather, it’s that boys are on average more inclined to play certain ways and girls are inclined to play other ways. Geula Zamist, the director of early childhood at a synagogue in New Jersey, recalls going to a museum gift shop with a friend many years ago. “I decided to buy all the children the same thing — a wooden recorder. By the time we got to the parking lot our 2-year-old boys were having a sword fight and our 4-year-old girls were giving a concert.” She says this is true in other instances as well. If you give boys and girls the same set of blocks, “boys will build tall towers and girls will build out flat.” So is our gender divide in toys entirely the product of nature? Obviously not. In fact, the researchers observed that babies and toddlers made almost no distinction between the blue and the pink teddy bears they were offered. Which suggests that certain things, like the color of a toy, only matter once kids are socialized to certain ideas — namely that pink is for girls and blue is for boys. But if you take a walk down any toy aisle, it quickly becomes apparent how significant that point is. The girls’ toy aisle looks like someone dumped a giant bottle of Pepto Bismol on it. Girls want not only princess dolls and pink cooking sets, they also start to want pink versions of games like Chutes and Ladders and Trouble. If you look into preschool classrooms, which usually have plain toys — wooden kitchens, dolls without clothing, simple blocks — you’ll see boys and girls moving more freely among different areas. There’ll generally be more boys in the blocks and more girls in the kitchen, but there is no flashing (pink) sign warning boys to keep away from the girl toys. But so much of toy companies’ success is actually tied to TV shows and movies that it’s making the divisions that are present naturally much more pronounced. Hasbro, which released its earnings last week, saw a 15 percent jump in what the company calls Partner Brand revenues — “Star Wars” for boys, Disney princesses for girls. If you want to “empower” your children, as the gender-norm warriors like to say, don’t take away your daughter’s dolls and give them trucks or demand your son stop using crayons as weapons. Instead, send kids to play outside more — girls and boys like to ride bicycles and play on swing sets — or buy them toys that aren’t tied to the latest movies or TV shows. However impossible it seems, it may mean doing more to separate our children from popular culture. Naomi Schaefer Riley is a senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A new study by researchers at the City University of London found that babies as young as 9 months old prefer to play with toys specific to their own gender, suggesting that gender preferences in toys are not solely a result of socialization, but also stem from biological differences.

Add punctuation: Cauchy was the first to make a rigorous study of the conditions for convergence of infinite series in addition to his rigorous definition of an integral","output":"Cauchy was the first to make a rigorous study of the conditions for convergence of infinite series. In addition to his rigorous definition of an integral, he also provided a foundation for the understanding of series convergence and laid the groundwork for future mathematicians to build upon. Cauchy's contribution to the field of mathematics is immense, and his work on infinite series and integrals is just one example. He explored a variety of mathematical concepts, including complex analysis, calculus, and algebra, with the same meticulous attention to detail and rigor that he brought to his study of infinite series. In his work on convergence, Cauchy looked at the conditions under which an infinite series would converge, meaning that the sum of its terms would approach a finite value. Before Cauchy, mathematicians had been working with infinite series without a clear understanding of the conditions necessary for convergence. As a result, erroneous conclusions were often drawn, leading to confusion and uncertainty. Cauchy's work not only established the rules for determining whether an infinite series converged, but it also clarified the importance of these rules. The Cauchy criterion for convergence played a critical role in the development of modern analysis, and it is still a cornerstone concept studied by mathematicians today. In addition to his work on convergence, Cauchy made significant contributions to the theory of integration. Before Cauchy, integration was often regarded as a somewhat magical process that, although it produced correct results, lacked a rigorous foundation. Cauchy changed this by introducing the concept of the definite integral, which provided a precise definition for the process of integration. Cauchy's definition of an integral relied on the concept of a limit, which he also defined rigorously. In doing so, Cauchy was able to demonstrate that integration was not just a convenient tool for solving problems, but a mathematically valid and well-defined process that could be rigorously understood and applied. In conclusion, Cauchy's work on the conditions for convergence of infinite series and his definition of an integral were foundational in establishing rigor and clarity in the field of mathematics. His concepts, from the Cauchy criterion to the definite integral, remain essential components of modern analysis, and Cauchy's contributions to the field continue to be recognized and respected by mathematicians worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I was one of the best fingerprint examiners in the world. I could do things the FBI thought impossible. I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say. He said, “Lady, you're the smartest cop I ever saw, and I hope to God I never see you again.” I think that was the best compliment I ever got. I have other accomplishments.

Given the below context:  On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime? Answer:","output":"To determine which police department (P.D.) took a more efficient approach in fighting crime based on the information provided, it's important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Greenville P.D. chose not to invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This might have allowed them to allocate more resources to other types of law enforcement, potentially increasing their ability to deal with a larger number of criminals. However, the lack of technology and advanced forensic methods could limit their success in solving cases, particularly complex ones. On the other hand, Grayville P.D. invested heavily in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. These tools can greatly increase the department's ability to solve cases and apprehend criminals, particularly in cases where traditional methods of investigation might not be as effective. However, the high cost of these technologies may have resulted in less funds being available for other types of law enforcement, potentially increasing the number of criminals not being dealt with. To accurately answer the question, one would need more information on the actual crime rates, clearance rates, and other relevant performance metrics in both Greenville and Grayville. With such data, a comparison of the efficiency of each approach could be made.

Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- The headline from one Swedish newspaper summed up the days to come for President Barack Obama: \\"Obama in the Shadow of War.\\" During a fast-paced three-day overseas trip that includes visits to Stockholm, Sweden and a G-20 summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the president will face allied, yet skeptical leaders who remain unconvinced that military action is necessary to punish Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Even as Obama administration officials acknowledge that Syria will be an ongoing subject of discussion, they dismiss the notion the president is fighting a losing diplomatic battle, noting support from both France and Turkey.

At the beginning of the film, they infiltrate a high security building and assassinate Chow Lui, the chairman of a top company in China. After their successful mission, a police inspector named Kong Yat-hung is assigned to investigate the case and she manages to track down the assassins.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Find that person you know will be real with you, and ask their opinion. Often when we're in crush-mode we can't get a good perspective on the situation. Your friend may be seeing something you don't, and could save you a lot of heartache, or she could give you the extra push you need to make a move and ask him out. Guys who are already in relationships are sometimes extra attractive to single girls. It may be because one girl has already given him her approval as boyfriend material, so you know he probably has good qualities.  You may feel competitive with the other girl, or you may get a temporary self-esteem boost from stealing someone else's guy. Let their relationship run its course and only pursue the guy when he's single. Does he spend all weekend in a dark room playing video games while you prefer to be out hiking and camping in your free time? Do you have similar values? Being different doesn't have to be a deal breaker--you may end up really complimenting each other and learning about things you never knew you liked. Consider if your differences can be worked through. If part of his personality is that he's a huge flirt and that makes you uncomfortable, it might lead to major problems down the road. Ultimately, it's up to you to figure out whether or not you like this guy--you know yourself better than anyone else. Don't make yourself crazy or miserable trying to figure it out.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat? from the following article ?  Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...","output":"The last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat is Henderson.

Translate this to English?","output":"After an eight-hour flight from Central Europe to Mombasa, the bus transfer to the Diani Sea Lodge Hotel takes about an hour. At the Diani Beach, there was quite a lot of wind, leading to considerable waves. The above passage describes a journey from Central Europe to a specific location in Kenya. Starting the journey with a long flight suggests that the location is quite a distance away from the starting point. The duration of the bus transfer indicates that the hotel could be located a significant distance from the Mombasa airport. Next, the setting changes from the journey to the destination where the hotel is situated, specifically at Diani Beach. We can infer from the description that Diani Beach could have a windy environment because the text describes a considerable presence of wind at that location. Additionally, the strong winds cause large waves along the shore of the beach. Going into more detail, the text could imply that this windy condition is either normal or abnormal for Dian Beach, however, no information is specified to support either implication. Regardless, the windy condition seems to influence the water's behavior, causing large or rough waves in the ocean adjacent to the beach. In conclusion, the excerpt is a brief account of a journey from Central Europe to Diani Sea Lodge Hotel, and the environmental condition at Diani Beach. Although brief, the text provides sufficient information to imagine the journey and the setting.

My wife and I went for lunch and ordered a sandwich (Lucca: Herb roasted turkey) and a bruschetta plate (Burnt Mozzarella & Pesto: Wild Mushroom: & Caramelized Red Onion & Fig Tapenade). FYI, there is no table service so you have to order at the counter.    I will say that the staff was friendly, so that's the positive, though there should have been more staff working the counter because it got backed up.   The sandwich tasted OK, but the presentation was unimaginative, the bread not fresh (so dry it was falling apart) and the portions smaller than similarly priced fare fare from other establishments we frequent.  Frankly, the best thing on our sandwich plate was the potato chips!  The bruschetta was laughable! For 6.99 we received 3 SMALL slices of bread that were only partially covered with a visually unappetizing mix of toppings. The bread was not adequately toasted so each piece was somewhat soggy. In addition, none of the toppings were warm, even though the cheese on two pieces was melted and the third topped with what we would describe as a chunky mushroom paste (that was claimed as served hot)... which led us to believe these items are prepared in advance and not to order, hence the cool temp and soggy bread.  Seriously! 6.99 for 3 small slices? Haven't the owners ever been to Postino to see what presentation, flavor and value are all about.   Check the photo link in my profile and you'll find the one I posted of QCOM's sorry excuse for a bruschetta plate.   And to all of you who will argue \\"but the Postino Bruschetta is 13.50\\"! Yes, it's nearly double the price, but at Postino you receive: A) 4 LARGE pieces of bruschetta, cut into thirds for 12 slices total, each slice about the size of one QCOM bruschetta; B) Easily triple the amount of toppings on each piece: C) something flavorful that you'll actually enjoy eating; D) A beautiful presentation; E) Table service from friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Don't get me wrong. I think it's great that the Rea Family has brought a fine range of olive oils and related products to Arizona and we have used their oils in our home kitchen.

Our suggestion, take the tour, buy some olive oil... then go somewhere else for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredients, prepared with skill, in sufficient quantity to justify the price and with friendly efficient service to boot.

And, in exchange, you could have a cheap vacation anywhere in the world. Just picture the scene: you're watching the sunset from the balcony of a Caribbean island house. It's large. And it's free as long as you don't mind the owners living in your home at the same time. All you need to be a home-swapper is the Internet and a rough idea of when and where you want to go on holiday. When you find someone whose dates match yours, and who wants to visit your area, you're all set to swap. The advantages are numerous: you can save a fortune in accommodation cost. You could get to use the owners' car, boat, bikes, pool or gym. You might even be able to come to an arrangement about looking after each other's pets! You also get to live like a local, and you might be invited around to neighbors' homes for tea, barbecues and tips on the area. People say that these cultural experiences are the memories that last. Plus, instead of one tiny hotel room, you have an entire house where you can make yourself at home. And it's not cold and impersonal like a hotel room. Of course, there are disadvantages. A lot of effort and communication are needed before the arrangements are finalized. Nobody wants a stranger living in their house, sleeping in their bed and using their bathroom, so you have to get to know each other well beforehand.

Firstly, the reviewer states that the food quality was below average, indicating dissatisfaction with the meal. They specifically mention the adventure spicy being less than medium, implying that the dish was not as flavorful or spicy as they would have preferred. The mention of the Tom ka soup and beef pad Thai serves to provide specific examples of the dishes they found lacking in quality. Secondly, the reviewer explicitly states that they would not recommend the restaurant, which is a clear indicator of a negative review. The dissatisfaction with the food is enough to make them dissuade others from dining at the establishment. Lastly, the restaurant's atmosphere and employee behavior are called into question, with a description of employees being reprimanded for incorrect usage of the credit card machine. This indicates that the management was not effective in handling employee training or addressing issues privately. The fact that these issues were happening in the presence of customers adds to the negative impression of the establishment, as it shows a lack of professionalism and organization.

Translate to English English:","output":"Understanding how resources are distributed is an essential tool for highlighting and correcting distortions. Knowledge of resource distribution plays a crucial role in various aspects of economic and social life. By understanding the mechanisms and patterns that govern the allocation of resources, individuals, organizations, and governments can identify and address inefficiencies, inequalities, and disruptions in the distribution of these resources. In economic systems, resources are typically distributed through markets, where supply and demand determine prices, and subsequently, the allocation of goods and services. This process is not always efficient or fair, as it can be influenced by factors such as monopolies, market power imbalances, asymmetric information, and externalities. Understanding these factors allows policymakers and regulatory authorities to devise targeted interventions and policies to correct market failures and ensure more equitable resource distribution. Inequality in resource distribution is often at the root of many social and political issues. By analyzing the origins of these disparities, it is possible to design policies and strategies addressing them at their source. For instance, unequal access to education, healthcare, or job opportunities can lead to substantial gaps in income and wealth distribution. Measures aimed at promoting more equal access to resources, such as progressive taxation, inclusive community development programs, and investment in disadvantaged areas, can help balance resource distribution and foster more inclusive societies. Furthermore, understanding resource distribution is also crucial in terms of sustainable development and environmental management. By identifying areas of excessive resource use or depletion, appropriate mitigation measures can be implemented to optimize resource allocation and promote sustainability. For example, analyzing water usage patterns can help identify regions where water scarcity is a pressing issue, and policies promoting water conservation can be introduced. In an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, understanding resource distribution dynamics goes beyond national borders. Integrated economies, supply chains, and investment flows also drive resource allocation patterns on a global level. This understanding can help promote international cooperation, identify global imbalances and dependencies, coordinate efforts to address shared challenges, and encourage joint sustainable development initiatives. In summary, understanding the way resources are distributed is essential for addressing economic, social, and environmental challenges. By identifying distortions and inefficiencies in resource allocation, policies and interventions can be designed to promote more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive societies. This understanding can also foster international cooperation and effective global governance, ensuring the just distribution of resources on a broader scale."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown A:","output":"The final step of the process outlined is the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the body. Let's examine the whole process in detail to better understand how it all works together. 1. Breathing in oxygen: The process begins when a person inhales oxygen either through their nose or mouth. Air moves into the nasal cavity or oral cavity, where it is filtered, warmed, and humidified. 2. Oxygen transport: The oxygen-rich air then travels down the trachea, which branches into two bronchi for each lung. The bronchi continue to divide into smaller and smaller bronchioles, which finally end in tiny sacs called alveoli. 3. Gas exchange in the lungs: Alveoli are surrounded by a network of thin-walled blood capillaries. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the bloodstream, where it binds with hemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells. This oxygenated blood is then carried back to the heart, which pumps it to the rest of the body. 4. Cellular respiration: Oxygen is delivered to the cells, where it plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. This process involves the conversion of glucose (a simple sugar) into usable energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. During cellular respiration, glucose breaks down in a series of complex reactions. 5. Production of carbon dioxide: The breakdown of glucose generates not only ATP but also water and carbon dioxide (CO2) as waste products. CO2 is a byproduct of the metabolic reactions that occur during the production of ATP and accumulates within the cells. 6. Expulsion of carbon dioxide: The final step in this process is the removal of CO2 from the body. CO2 diffuses out of the cells into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin or dissolves in plasma. The blood, now carrying CO2, returns to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs. In the alveoli, CO2 diffuses from the blood into the air sacs, essentially reversing the process that occurred during gas exchange. Then, the person exhales the CO2-rich air out of their body through the mouth or nose, completing the cycle and allowing for a continuous exchange of gases necessary for life. In summary, the final step of this process is the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This intricate series of events ensures that our cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production while efficiently removing waste products generated during cellular respiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.  Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

The apples didn't freeze well in the old refrigerator's freezer, so they made an icebox and finished the job. The","output":"frost on the windows was relentless, but the people inside the old cabin were content. Winter had stretched on longer than they had ever known, and supplies had dwindled down to the last few apples and some canned food. It was a tough time for the small family of four. James, the father, was a skilled carpenter who had built their rustic cabin by hand. He had grown up on tales of adventure and survival from his grandfather, and these stories had fueled his desire to move away from the city and live a life closer to nature. His wife, Emily, had been a kindergarten teacher before they settled in this remote area, and now she was responsible for homeschooling their two children, Peggy and Sam. They had planned meticulously before moving to the cabin in the woods, determined to live a more sustainable and self-sufficient lifestyle. Their chickens provided fresh eggs, and the large vegetable garden had sustained them for most of the year. They had also built a greenhouse so they could grow produce throughout the winter, but the relentless snow had crushed the fragile structure, leaving them with meager supplies to get through the season. It had been Emily's idea to save the apples for the coldest months, but sadly, their old refrigerator's freezer hadn't served them well. The apples had started to brown and rot before freezing completely, but they would not let this damper their spirits or their survival instincts. James had quickly come up with the idea of an icebox – a technique he had learned from his grandfather. The family gathered around the fireplace, taking turns reading aloud from their favorite books as they listened to the wind howling outside. The crackling fire provided warmth and comfort as they snuggled under handmade blankets Emily had crafted from old clothes and fabric scraps. They listened intently as James detailed his simple, yet ingenious plan for constructing a makeshift icebox to freeze the remainder of their apples. He explained how he would build a sturdy wooden box and layer its interior with insulation made from hay and dried leaves. They would then transport several chunks of ice from the frozen stream nearby to fill the icebox, ensuring the temperature within would drop significantly. Finally, they'd store the apples inside, and every couple of days, they'd empty the melting water and replace the ice as needed. The entire family agreed to help with each step of the process. Peggy and Sam, eager to participate, volunteered to help their dad collect ice from the stream. While the children ventured cautiously outside, clad in thick jackets and woolen hats, Emily stayed behind with James to help build the icebox. Over the course of two days, they toiled tirelessly, and the icebox finally took shape. The result was a rudimentary but effective way to freeze the remainder of their apples and extend their food supply. Though their fingers were calloused and their backs ached, they rejoiced in their accomplishment, heartened by their ability to adapt and endure. As the family gathered once more around the fireplace, with the icy wind whistling through the cracks in the walls, they passed around the now-frozen apples, feeling a sense of camaraderie that only comes from overcoming challenges. In the flickering firelight, their faces glowed with gratitude for the simple things – their loved ones, their shelter, and the apples they had all worked so hard to preserve. The long winter nights seemed less daunting as long as they had one another. As the days stretched into weeks, the family continued to work together, fixing and improving various aspects of their homestead. Their resourcefulness and resilience would carry them through the winter and beyond. The tale of their icebox would be passed down from generation to generation, a reminder that with determination, cooperation, and a strong sense of community, even the harshest of winters could be conquered. And now, whenever they would look up at the sparkling stars in the night sky, they knew that they could face any challenge together as a family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ali Mohammed Al-Nimr was arrested aged 17 after participating in anti-government protests in 2012. He was accused of protesting illegally and being in possession of firearms.      Ali was initially held at a juvenile offenders’ facility. Reports indicate that he was tortured and signed a confession under duress. The appeal was held in secret and dismissed, with no remaining legal routes of objection to his sentence of “death by crucifixion”, initially handed down on 27 May 2014.      Maya Foa, Director of the death penalty team at legal charity Reprieve, said: “No one should have to go through the ordeal Ali has suffered – torture, forced ‘confession’, and an unfair, secret trial process, resulting in a sentence of death by ‘crucifixion’.”      “But worse still, Ali was a vulnerable child when he was arrested and this ordeal began. His execution – based apparently on the authorities’ dislike for his uncle, and his involvement in anti-government protests – would violate international law and the most basic standards of decency. It must be stopped.”      A number of people, including minors, have been sentenced to death following their involvement in demonstrations that swept the MENA region during the Arab Spring. ||||| A prisoner in Saudi Arabia, who was sentenced to death as a child, faces \\"death by crucifixion\\" after a final appeal has been dismissed. Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested on 14 February 2012 when he was just 17, during a crackdown on anti-government protests in the Shiite province of Qatif. He was accused by the authorities of participation in illegal protests and of firearms offences, despite there being no evidence to justify the latter charge.      Ali was initially held at a juvenile offenders facility, where he was denied access to lawyers. Evidence indicates that he was tortured and forced to sign a document which was tantamount to a confession. The signed document formed the basis of the case against him and he was convicted of the alleged offences by the Specialised Criminal Court (SCC). However, the trials failed to meet international standards. Ali and his family have strongly denied the charges against him, but, after the final appeal - which was held in secret and without Ali's knowledge - was dismissed, there are few legal options remaining to oppose the sentence originally handed down on 27 May 2014. It is feared that Ali could be executed in a matter of days.      The case against Ali appears to be based on his familial connection to Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a 53-year old critic of the Saudi regime and a prominent religious leader in the Kingdom, who is his uncle. Mr Al Nimr was sentenced to death by crucifixion on charges including 'insulting the King' and delivering religious sermons that 'disrupt national unity'. This week, it emerged that the authorities plan to execute Ali's uncle on Thursday (17 September) sparking fears that his nephew will also be killed.      Human rights organization Reprieve has urged the European Union to intervene with Saudi Arabia to prevent the killings.      Commenting on the inhumane and unjust sentence, Maya Foa, Director of the death penalty team at legal charity Reprieve said: \\"No one should have to go through the ordeal Ali has suffered – torture, forced 'confession,' and an unfair, secret trial process, resulting in a sentence of death by 'crucifixion.' But worse still, Ali was a vulnerable child when he was arrested and this ordeal began. His execution – based apparently on the authorities' dislike for his uncle, and his involvement in anti-government protests – would violate international law and the most basic standards of decency. It must be stopped.\\"      Ali is just one of a number of young protestors including Dawoud Hussain al-Marhoon, who have been sentenced to death following involvement in anti-government protests. In January 2015, prominent Saudi blogger Raif Al-Badawi received the first of 1000 lashes as part of his sentence for his statements criticising the Saudi regime in 2012.      In a post to the NGO's website Foa added: \\"Saudi Arabia's wave of executions since the start of this year has provoked widespread disgust. But these killings, if they are allowed to go ahead, will mark a new low.\\"      Despite global condemnation, the Saudi Government has continued to carry out executions at a high rate since King Salman came to power in January 2015. On May 6th 2015, the Kingdom carried out its 79th execution of the year, and it is already close to surpassing its 2014 total of 87 executions. The Saudi government maintains all cases are tried in accordance with Sharia law, and with strict fair trial standards observed.      According to Amnesty International Saudi Arabia has one of the highest execution rates in the world, with only China and Iran carrying out more judicial killings.      A Facebook page has been created to rally support in protest at the death sentence on Ali Mohammed al-Nimr. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article brings attention to the case of Ali Mohammed Al-Nimr, a juvenile prisoner in Saudi Arabia who was arrested at the age of 17 for participating in anti-government protests in 2012.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

How did the hijackers manage to smuggle weapons, such as knives or box cutters, on board the plane? Were there any security lapses at the airport that allowed them to do so? 3. How did the hijackers manage to subdue or neutralize the crew and passengers effectively and swiftly without facing significant resistance? 4. What were the standard hijacking protocols for flight crew members at that time, and did they change significantly in response to the events of 9/11? 5.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the earth moves farther from the sun happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the Earth moving farther from the Sun can have an indirect effect on the process of the greenhouse effect. If the Earth moves farther from the Sun, it would receive less solar radiation. As a direct result, the overall temperature of the Earth would decrease. This would lead to an imbalance in the energy received and emitted by the Earth. In response to this cooling, there might be an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, as various natural processes attempt to compensate for the lower solar radiation and maintain global temperature equilibrium. This could potentially lead to a greater greenhouse effect. However, it is important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and the actual outcome would depend on various factors such as the rate at which the Earth moves away from the Sun, the specific changes in solar radiation levels, and complex feedback mechanisms within the Earth's climate system.

Here are the steps I will take: Step 1: Simplify the equation if possible. Step 2: Isolate the term containing d. Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d. Step 4: Solve for d. Step 1: Simplify the equation if possible. -115*d + 8860 = 5313 - 3238 We can simplify the right side of the equation by evaluating 5313 - 3238. -115*d + 8860 = 2075 There are no further simplifications possible. Step 2: Isolate the term containing d. To isolate the term containing d, we need to move the constant term from the left side of the equation to the right side. To do this, we will subtract 8860 from both sides of the equation. -115*d + 8860 - 8860 = 2075 - 8860 Which simplifies to: -115*d = -6785 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d (-115). Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by -115 to solve for d. (-115*d) / (-115) = (-6785) / (-115) Step 4: Solve for d.

People call these strange objects Unidentified Flying Objects(UFOs). These UFOs caused a lot of interest. Some of the reports about them are difficult to believe. Some have been explained in scientific ways. Others have never been explained. Here is an account of UFOs from a report. Dennis Burdens, who wrote an article, tells us that he once saw a UFO himself. He was having dinner one night with a friend near Tripoli, Libya, and after dinner the two men walked across a yard to his room to look at some papers. Burdens noticed that the moon looked strange that night. \\"It wasn't the moon,\\" was the reply. They watched the light and saw that it was moving. It seemed to be an object rather like a big plate. In some ways it looked like smoke with a light on it, but it wasn't smoke because it didn't change its shape. It was moving in a regular way. That is to say, it didn't go suddenly faster or more slowly, and it didn't go higher or lower. So the two men decided that there must be men in it. After that, Burdens said that he felt eyes looking at him. He was being watched in the darkness. When it was nearer, they noticed that the bottom parts were brighter than the top. The bottom was yellow and the top red. Then the object suddenly turned away and left Libya, moving very fast. On a later day Burdens talked to other people about it, and he found some who had seen it. They all described it in the same way. Could they all be mistaken? Question: UFOs are  _  .

We want to find what number \\"r\\" is. Here is the problem: -47r + 9275 = 17737 - 9919 1. First, let's subtract 9919 from 17737 (on the right side of the equation): 17737 - 9919 = 7818 Now we have: -47r + 9275 = 7818 2. Next, we want to get rid of the 9275 on the left side to have only \\"-47r\\" left. So, we'll subtract 9275 from both sides: -47r + 9275 - 9275 = 7818 - 9275 This simplifies to: -47r = -1457 3. Now, we have \\"-47r\\" on the left side, and we want to find what \\"r\\" is. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -47 (it's like taking away 47 frowny faces!): (-47r) / (-47) = (-1457) / (-47) This gives us: r = 31 There we go! The solution to the problem is r = 31.

Question: Who are considered the best of the Union's repo men? Movie plot title: Repo Men Movie plot: In 2025, a corporation called The Union has perfected the creation of artificial organs, which have replaced organ transplants. A potential customer can apply for an organ, which is sold on credit, at high interest. If a customer is unable to maintain payments, after three months, a repo-man is sent after the customer to 'reclaim' Union property. The process of the repossession is bloody & brutal, and often results in the death of the customer.Remy is one of the Union's top repo-men, who partners with his childhood friend, Jake, to collect on past due accounts. Remy is highly regarded within The Union as their top performer, though his occupation causes problems with his wife, who sees it as unsavory. After she leaves Remy when Jake commits a repossession in front of their home, Remy decides to transfer to a sales job, much to Jake's chagrin.As his final repossession job, Remy is sent to the residence of a music producer, whose work he happens to admire. After allowing the man enough time to complete a song, Remy prepares to repossess his heart. When he attempts to use a heart defibrillator to stop the unit, the defibrillator malfunctions, sending a large electrical shock through his body and knocking him into a coma. When Remy awakens from his coma, he is informed by Jake and Frank, his co-workers, that the shock severely damaged his heart. He can be fitted with an artificial heart, or die. After Remy attempts to flee the hospital, he reluctantly agrees to the procedure.Remy goes back to work, but is unable to perform his job, because he is just like the people he is repossessing from. He attempts to transition into sales, but quickly finds himself behind in payments. Jake takes Remy to the outskirts of the city to a nest, which is a collection of people who have past due accounts with the Union, but are fleeing to avoid being repossessed. Remy is again unable to perform a repossession, after which he is abandoned by Jake until he can perform his job. Remy is attacked by a pair of men from whom he was...

This is clearly a list as it meets the standard format of a list in many programming languages, with comma separated values enclosed in brackets. Part #2: Remove all duplicates from the list. Usage: A duplicate in a list is a number that appears more than once. In our example list \\"[3, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 6, 0]\\", the numbers 0 and 5 are duplicates, as they appear more than once. The list after removing duplicates would be \\"[3, 5, 4, 6]\\", since those are all the unique numbers (numbers that occur only once) in the list.

Answer the following question: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes.  Which ice cube will melt faster?  Hint: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point . Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided and the principles of phase transitions, Ice cube B will melt faster in this experiment.  When heat is added to a substance like ice, its particles gain kinetic energy and start moving more rapidly. As the motion of the particles increases, they overcome the attractive forces holding them together. When the temperature reaches the melting point, the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid.  In Kendra's experiment, the burner for ice cube A is set at a low temperature, while the burner for ice cube B is set quite a bit higher. Consequently, ice cube B will receive more energy from its burner than ice cube A in the given time period, leading to a faster increase in kinetic energy and a quicker transition to the liquid phase. Therefore, ice cube B will melt faster than ice cube A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

We got there around 7:30 and the hostess offered for us to sit at the bar area for happy hour or for a 10 minute wait for the dining area. We opted for the dining area. (happy hour stops at 7..so that was never really an option?) the service was pretty slow. My husband stupidly agreed to ordering cheesesticks when the waitress offered.. I was definitely not impressed with the 9 cheesesticks. He ordered some kind of pasta dish and I ordered a salad. The portions we got for both were not very big, they tasted fine, just small. The check took forever to come.

I can't remember the whole name something palm.. Anyways the drink came in a small square mason jar.. And it was really tasty.. But it literally couldn't have had any alcohol in it..

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Where was the French stronghold during the battle?\\"  Context: \\"By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"During the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French stronghold was positioned around the two villages of Aspern and Essling, which were strategically important as they formed the focal points of the French bridgehead across the Danube River. These villages served as essential locations for the French to maintain control over their crossing point and resist the Austrian forces. Throughout the battle, the French, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, faced a significantly larger Austrian army commanded by Archduke Charles. The French forces were engaged in a desperate struggle to protect their positions in Aspern and Essling from being overrun by the Austrians. Initially, the French managed to hold onto both villages; however, by the end of the two-day-long battle, they had lost control of Aspern, while still retaining control over Essling. The French stronghold in Essling served an important purpose, as it allowed them to withstand the ongoing Austrian artillery bombardment and maintain a bridgehead on the northern side of the Danube. However, the substantial losses inflicted on both sides, along with the continuous bombardment, forced Napoleon to reevaluate the situation and ultimately withdraw his remaining troops onto Lobau Island, which lay in the middle of the river. Even though Napoleon faced defeat during the Battle of Aspern-Essling, his stronghold's location in the villages of Aspern and Essling was of vital significance, as it enabled the French army to establish a foothold across the Danube. The fierce fighting and eventual withdrawal by the French marked a turning point, as it was the first time Napoleon had been defeated in a major battle, igniting hope throughout Europe that he could be overcome on the battlefield."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the premise, we know that the museum includes a collection of paintings from 1850 to 1950. This range falls within both the 19th century (1801-1900) and the 20th century (1901-2000). 2. The hypothesis we are analyzing states that the Musee d'Art Moderne has over 150 paintings starting in the 19th century. We can infer that the hypothesis is making a claim about the quantity of paintings in the museum (specifically from the 19th century onwards).  3. The premise does not provide any information regarding the number of paintings in the museum's collection. Thus, we do not have enough information to confirm or disprove the hypothesis based on the premise provided.  In conclusion, the given premise does not entail the hypothesis, and we cannot determine whether the Musee d'Art Moderne has over 150 paintings from the 19th century based solely on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pupils at a school which is the focus of 'Lord of the Flies' abuse claims abseiled naked while teachers watched, it has been reported. Stanbridge Earls School, which is currently embroiled in a police investigation into alleged sexual abuse of pupils, announced yesterday it will close in December and another school has been lined up to take over the site. But today it was revealed that Ofsted inspectors carrying out emergency visits to the school were told three male pupils had been naked during a school trip to the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban. Inspectors heard two female members of staff watched while the boys abseiled and allegedly took photographs of them during the May half-term trip. The incident has been reported to police by the special needs school's headteacher Maggie McMurray, the Sunday Times reported. The Department for Education confirmed the county council and police were investigating the situation at the school, where a 15-year-old girl was sexually abused by fellow pupils. A spokesman said:  'We have just received advice from Ofsted following an inspection that took place last week. 'Ministers are studying that advice and will announce their decisions about regulatory action very soon.  It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied their findings, but all options remain open.' The Charity Commission, the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, has opened astatutory inquiry into Stanbridge Earls School. A spokesman for the adventure centre told MailOnline that it had 'an unblemished record' for child protection in the 38 years it had been run as a family business. 'Considering the special needs nature of the school, our on-site instructor was looking for a lead from the two female members of the teaching staff who were present throughout this incident,' he added. 'While neither intervened, he saw his primary concern as being for the boys’ health and safety during the climb. 'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children. 'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children.' - Spokesman for the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban. 'We have however contacted the police about the incident to offer our full support on any follow up inquiries. 'We are also further clarifying our existing guidelines for our staff to ensure intervening action is taken should we ever see a repeat of an incident like this in future.' On Friday Mrs McMurray wrote to parents announcing Stanbridge Earls' planned closure. She said the school, in Hampshire, had 'for some considerable time now been experiencing many difficulties... most of which are a legacy of past events'. She said the school had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils at the school, leading it into financial difficulties. Ofsted was due to report on its findings following an 'unannounced inspection' last week, according to investigative news website Exaro. The school's announcement comes as a major police investigation continues into allegations that a 15-year-old girl was raped and a 12-year-old girl stripped and sexually assaulted by male pupils. Detectives are also investigating if the school perverted the course of justice, amid claims pupils were ordered not to report incidents to anyone outside the school. The mother of the 15-year-old has compared behaviour at the school to the classic novel Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, in which children stranded on an island without adults torment each other with savage cruelty. 'Financial difficulties': The headteacher said it had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils there. Earlier this year a tribunal ruled that the school had discriminated against a pupil, who suffered 'appalling abuse' at the hands of another student. It found a number of staff members. failed to tell the youngster’s parents that she had complained of pain. in an intimate part of her body. And it said the school had been 'unsystematic, unprofessional, ad hoc and completely inadequate' when it came to protecting her. The Special Educational Needs and. Disability Tribunal awarded the girl's family £85,000 after ruling the. school failed to respond properly to her allegations of sexual abuse by. other boys at the school. The. tribunal was damning of the school’s then head teacher Peter Trythall, saying he 'failed to recognise that non-consensual sex is actually rape.' Mr Trythall stepped down from his role in April this year and was replaced by Mrs McMurray. Stanbridge. Earls is an independent special school for 190 children with learning. difficulties. It takes boarders aged 10 to 19, and charges between. £25,000 and £39,000 a year. One parent told Exaro: 'I hope that lessons can truly be learnt. We are delighted, although saddened, at the school’s closure.' The new school is due to be a sister establishment to Gard'ner Memorial's More House School, in Surrey.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell!

Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body?  Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that the Red River had fewer fish laying eggs outside of the body. The given paragraph states that the fish in the Red River had hardly reproduced naturally, which implies a lower rate of sexual reproduction and therefore a lower rate of eggs being laid and fertilized outside the body. In contrast, the Black River fish population doubled in two years due to natural reproduction, which indicates a higher rate of sexual reproduction and more fish laying eggs outside of the body. Both rivers have fish that reproduce sexually by laying eggs, but the key difference is the success rate of reproduction, with the Black River having a more successful reproduction rate, leading to a higher number of fish laying eggs outside of the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The man is sitting in front of a piano. 5. The man is reading. In the provided information, we have: 1. The man has brown hair. 2. The man is enjoying a nice day outside. 3. The man is in front of his porch. We can see that there is a match between both statements in terms of the man's brown hair, but the remaining details listed in the premise are not mentioned or confirmed in the provided information. Firstly, there is no mention of the man's attire (glasses, dark polo shirt, and jeans) in the provided information. We can't conclude whether he is wearing those specific items or not. Secondly, the man is said to be enjoying a nice day outside in front of his porch. While it is possible that he could be sitting and performing activities like reading, it is not explicitly stated, and we cannot draw concrete conclusions based on assumptions alone. Lastly, it is not mentioned whether the man is in front of a piano or not. While it's not impossible for someone to place a piano on a porch, we can't make that leap without evidence to support this idea.

Lynch told the city's devastated gay community, \\"We stand with you in the light.\\" She also announced a 1 million emergency grant to help Florida law enforcement pay for overtime costs related to the shooting, and she met with prosecutors, first responders and victims of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Her visit comes as investigators continue to dig into the background of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people and injured dozens more on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  Now, I have a new situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  Answer this question please: In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In case A, the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects. This is because the transgenic crop plants have been engineered to express the genes for the Bt toxin in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the Bt toxin is already active and binds to the insect's gut wall, causing it to stop feeding and eventually die. In contrast, case B involves the use of a Bt toxin spray, which is in an inactive state and requires digestion by the insect in order to become active and have any effect."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps.\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick your answer from: [+] No. [+] Yes. Answer:","output":"[+] No. A more detailed and long answer would be: A feedback mechanism in plants during respiration is a biological process that allows plants to adjust and maintain a balance within their cellular processes. It ensures the efficient use of available resources and the regulation of factors such as temperature, light, and CO2 concentration. During respiration in plants, glucose molecules are broken down through a complex series of chemical reactions to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The respiration process consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle), and the electron transport chain. Feedback mechanisms in plants involve various regulatory processes, such as allosteric regulation on enzymes and accumulation of metabolites. These feedback mechanisms enable plants to detect any potential imbalances and respond accordingly. For example, if the ATP levels in a plant cell are high, the excess ATP will inhibit some of the enzymes involved in glycolysis, thus slowing down the process to prevent the overproduction of ATP. Conversely, if the ATP levels are low, these inhibitory effects will be reversed, allowing glycolysis and, subsequently, the other stages of cellular respiration to proceed more rapidly. The statement \\"This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps\\" does not constitute a reasonable answer, as it does not specifically address the feedback mechanisms involved in respiration. Instead, the statement refers to the complexity of the process but does not delve into the regulatory aspects that are essential to understanding feedback mechanisms in plants. In summary, feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of cellular processes in plants, particularly during respiration. These mechanisms involve various regulatory processes that allow plants to adjust and respond to changes in their internal and external environment, ensuring the efficient use of resources and the overall health of the plant."},{"instruction":"Context: Lee and his father laughed together while preparing dinner for the family.

Obamacare 'paid' enrollment drops to 9.9M Of the current tally, most of the enrollments, 7.2 million people, came from the federally run Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov, which serves 37 states. The remaining 2.7 million enrolled through state-run exchanges. About 84 percent of all Obamacare customers—8.3 million people—received received a subsidy, or tax credit, to reduce the cost of their monthly premium. Officials said that the average subsidy was 270 per month. Subsidies are available to people who have incomes between one and four times the federal poverty level, or 11,670 and 46,680 for a single person. HHS noted Tuesday that 9 out of the 10 states with the highest rates of consumers getting Obamacare subsidies were states that as of June 30 had not expanded their Medicaid programs to allow most poor adults who earn below 15,654 annually for an individual to enroll in that government-run health coverage program. Mississippi, the leader among those states, had more than 94 percent of its Obamacare customers receive subsidies. More than half of customers nationally, or 5.6 million people, also received federal assistance paying for medical costs that are not covered by their insurance plans. That cost-sharing help is available to people with low incomes who enroll in so-called silver Obamacare plans, which tend to be the second-least expensive types of plans on the exchanges. Obamacare's next open enrollment season for 2016 plans begins Nov. 1, and will run through Jan. 31. Experts have predicted that getting additional people to sign up for health plans on the government-run marketplaces could prove more difficult this year and in the future, because many people who were eager to get coverage have already signed up, while the remaining uninsured may be disinclined to enroll or feel the plans are not affordable. However, the minimum penalty for failing to have some form of health coverage will rise considerably in 2016, and could motivate some bystanders to sign up. That penalty, which this year is the higher of 2 percent of adjustable gross household income or 325 per adult, rises next year to the higher of 2.5 percent of household income or 695 per adult. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"As of June 30, 2015, the number of people enrolled in Obamacare dropped to 9.9 million, with 84% of these customers receiving subsidies for their monthly premiums.

Everyone is getting unwell.\\" This may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD  53 wrote it. We all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives? Picture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel? Inventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity  often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives. One family in the UK went \\"back in time\\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones. The grandmother, Lyn, said, \\"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a \\"trendy , beer-drinking granny\\", to one who cooked things.

What is the answer??","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step: Step 1: Simplify the equation Given the equation, 9*d = -6 + 6 - 0. Before solving for 'd', let's simplify the equation by combining the numerical terms on the right side of the equation.  -6 + 6 = 0  Now, the equation becomes: 9*d = 0 - 0 Lastly, let's address the 0 - 0. This expression equals 0. Therefore, the simplified equation is: 9*d = 0 Step 2: Solve for 'd' Now, we have a simplified equation, 9*d = 0.  There is only one unknown variable, 'd', on the left side of the equation, so to find the value of 'd', we need to isolate 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 9. (9*d) / 9 = 0 / 9 Since 9/9 is equal to 1, the left side of the equation becomes: 1*d or simply d On the right side, any number divided by zero is also zero, so: 0 / 9 = 0 Now, the equation is: d = 0 So, 'd' equals 0, and that's the solution to the given equation 9*d = -6 + 6 - 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria?  Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.

Article: Do people ever consider the possibility that, if they're exposed to increased reports about a social problem, it's the reporting that has increased rather than the problem? It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others. The rise of social media is what people don't typically think of as a positive force in society. But Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire says, \\"These technologies might have prevented crime and bullying by providing more ways of help, more forms of social supervision, and interesting activities that destroy forms of alienation  that lead to crime\\".

The other options do not fit well in the context: 1) \\"goes into a bedroom and grabs a bucket with beer\\" doesn't follow the kitchen setting. 2) \\"shakes a can while talking and pouring the contents in his mouth\\" would be more relevant to a soft drink than beer. 3) \\"pours the beer into a shaker and shakes it\\" is an unlikely scenario since beer is not typically shaken before being served."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Does not reflect the whole truth and too biased Review: This book looks quite biased with elements of racism, just look at his \\"monkey on the top of elephant\\" about soldiers who won that ugly war and saved the world from fascism. I would recommend a good review of this book before you start reading [...] Answer:","output":"Based on the customer's review, it is clear that they are dissatisfied with the product, which in this case is a book. The reviewer expresses their concern regarding the book's content by stating that it \\"looks quite biased with elements of racism.\\" They specifically mention the \\"monkey on the top of elephant\\" statement, which appears to be an offensive metaphor that the book uses to negatively portray soldiers who fought and won a war against fascism. This clearly upsets the reviewer, as they believe it fails to acknowledge the true nature and importance of these soldiers' actions. Furthermore, the reviewer's dissatisfaction is emphasized through their recommendation for potential readers to thoroughly review the book before committing to reading it. Their use of the phrase \\"before you start reading\\" implies that they believe the book's content may not be worth readers' time and investment. Additionally, the title of the review, \\"Does not reflect the whole truth and too biased,\\" explicitly states that the reviewer found the book to be a partial representation of the events described and heavily influenced by the author's personal opinion or prejudice. In conclusion, the reviewer appears to be dissatisfied with the book due to its biased nature, potential elements of racism, and its failure to provide an accurate and complete account of the historical subject matter. The negative tone and specific examples provided in the review clearly demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is found by local villagers who nurse him back to health. In the small village of Dongmakgol, time appears to stand still. They have no knowledge of modern technology, such as firearms, explosives, motor vehicles and aircraft. All villagers are unaware of the massive conflict within Korea. Meanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean and South Korean soldiers have an encounter, and the ensuing gunfight leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving soldiers from the North manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa (Jung Jae-young), Jang Young-hee (Im Ha-ryong), and Seo Taek-gi (Ryu Deok-hwan) are found by an odd girl Yeo-il (Kang Hye-jung) who acts crazy. She leads them to the village, where to their astonishment, they find two South Korean soldiers Pyo Hyun-chul (Shin Ha-kyun) and Moon Sang-sang (Seo Jae-kyung). The South Korean soldiers, who have both deserted their units, had also been led to the village which is housing the injured U.S. Navy pilot, Smith, by a different villager.

Write some highlights for the following article: People who were injured in the nerve gas attack that killed 1,429 people in Syria have been flown to the UK for secret treatment and tests, according to a rebel leader. Ahmad Asi al-Jarba, the president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said a 'small number' of victims were in the UK and the deadly gas Sarin was found in their bodies. 'The president was told (on Thursday) during a meeting that the results from the examinations confirmed sarin gas on these individuals,' said Hadi Albahra, the secretary of the political committee within the coalition. Horror: A video that reportedly shows victims of the sarin gas attack in a neighbourhood in Damascus. A few victims are being treated and tested in the UK, reports a Syrian opposition official. The two or three victims are from the Ghouta area and would remain in Britain until they have recovered, reports The Sunday Times. He added: 'They are in a stable condition but they found traces of sarin gas inside their systems.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not confirm the Syrian statement. The news comes as a survey revealed that British voters oppose military action over Syria - even if it is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its own people. Syria claims rebels carried out the August 21 attack. The Sunday Telegraph poll shows a large proportion of voters do not want a second Commons vote on military intervention, even if the UN confirms the attacks. A Syrian man mourning over a dead body after the alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces. A total of 46 per cent say MPs should not vote again if proof is found, while 36 per cent say they should. Meanwhile 47 per cent says Britain should take no military action, but continue to provide aid. Nearly 20 per cent say Britian should take military action along with the U.S. The White House is making a big push to rally members of Congress and the American public behind President Barack Obama's plan for a U.S. military strike against Syria. Recent opinion surveys show intense American skepticism about military intervention in Syria, even among those who believe Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people. Anger: Protesters against U.S. military action in Syria march to Capitol Hill from the White House in Washington on Saturday,. At least 150 people picketed outside the White House on Saturday to oppose any military action against Syria. Demonstrations also took place in New York City, Boston and Indianapolis and in Louisiana and Michigan. Syria's use of chemical weapons is 'an evil we must stand up to one way or another', William Hague said today, but insisted the Government was not 'gung-ho' about military action. The Foreign Secretary will hold talks in London tomorrow with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as Washington seeks to bolster international support for an armed response. He insisted the US remained 'very committed' to the so-called special relationship despite MPs defeating David Cameron to vote against a strike against Bashar Assad's regime. An F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea. Just 19 per cent of voters think the UK should take military action alongside the U.S. U.S. lawmakers are now deciding whether a military response is warranted. President Obama has assured Americans action in Syria will not lead to a full invasion like in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Hague said he was determined to ensure Britain does not 'matter less' in the world in future. Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said he recognised there was 'a lot of public unease about intervention overseas'. 'Be reassured that we have learned lessons of Iraq. We are not seeking to be drawn into wars in the Middle East. We now make decisions in a completely different way,' he said. 'We are not a Government that is gung-ho about military action.' But he said Britain must also not 'turn in on ourselves'. Mr Hague added: 'Britain has great and positive influence in the world, and we must make sure that we retain that. I am very determined, as the Prime Minister is, that we will not matter less.' Foreign Secretary William Hague on the Andrew Marr Show. He said the British Government is not 'gung-ho' about military action. The Government was 'not planning to go back again' to the Commons for another vote, he said. 'If circumstances change dramatically, then of course everybody would be looking at things in a different light,' he accepted. But he said there was 'no guarantee' that Labour would not repeat its 'rather opportunistic and partisan' decision to oppose the Government motion. 'On major issues of international peace and security, oppositions should be able to rise above that. So there would be no guarantee on a future occasion that they would not behave in that way again.' Mr Hague said it was right for the UK to supply the Syrian National Coalition with non-lethal equipment. 'Terrible things do happen on both sides but that does not mean that everyone in Syria is evil. As in any country, there are millions of people who just want peace and democracy and freedom.'","output":"- Nerve gas attack victims from Syria are secretly being treated in the UK - Tests conducted on victims revealed presence of deadly sarin gas - Survey shows majority of British voters oppose military action in Syria, even if regime's use of chemical weapons is proven According to Ahmad Asi al-Jarba, the president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, a small number of victims from the nerve gas attack in Syria are being treated and tested in the UK.

Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship.

Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What does the SCRA require?","output":"The State Committee on Religious Affairs (SCRA) requires several elements for a religious community to successfully register. These requirements include: 1. A charter: A religious community must have a document that outlines its governance structure, mission, and key principles. This charter serves as the foundational constitution for the group and provides a clear understanding of its purpose and functions. 2. A list of 10 or more members: The SCRA requires that a religious community has at least 10 members who are consenting and active participants in the group. This demonstrates a level of credibility and communal support for the religious community's existence. 3. Evidence of local government approval for the prayer site location: Religious communities need to provide proof that they have obtained approval from their local government for their designated site of worship. This assures that the location meets necessary legal and safety standards. 4. Registration with local authorities: In addition to registering with the SCRA, religious communities must also register with their local authorities. This ensures that they are recognized and accountable at both the national and local levels. Fulfilling these requirements is essential for the registration process. Failure to do so could result in penalties such as large fines and closures of their places of worship. Additionally, it is important to note that unregistered religious groups without a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer, and individuals under the age of 18 are barred from participating in public religious practices.

Led by Lord Hartington (later the Duke of Devonshire) and Joseph Chamberlain, the party formed a political alliance with the Conservative Party in opposition to Irish Home Rule. The two parties formed the ten-year-long, coalition Unionist Government 18951905 but kept separate political funds and their own party organisations until a complete merger was agreed in May 1912.  - A coalition of the Conservative and Liberal Unionist parties took power in the United Kingdom following the general election of 1895. The Conservative leader, Lord Salisbury, took office as prime minister, and his nephew, Arthur Balfour, was leader of the Commons, but various major posts went to the Liberal Unionist leaders, most notably the Liberal Unionist leader in the Lords, the Duke of Devonshire, who was made Lord President, and his colleague in the Commons, Joseph Chamberlain, who became Colonial Secretary. It was this government which would conduct the Boer War from 1899 to 1902, which was exploited by the government to help win a landslide victory in the general election of 1900.    What is the relationship between 'percy clive' and 'conservative party'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Percy Clive was initially a member of the Liberal Unionist Party, which was formed in 1886 after a faction broke away from the Liberal Party. The Liberal Unionist Party, led by Lord Hartington and Joseph Chamberlain, formed a political alliance with the Conservative Party in opposition to Irish Home Rule. This alliance led to the formation of a coalition Unionist Government between 1895 and 1905. The parties kept separate political funds and their own party organizations until a complete merger was agreed upon in May 1912. Percy Clive was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ross division of Herefordshire during the \\"khaki election\\" of 1900, while fighting in the Second Boer War. The coalition government he was part of, led by the Conservative Party and Liberal Unionist Party, would conduct the Boer War from 1899 to 1902. After the merger of the Unionist parties in 1912, Percy Clive became a member of the Conservative Party. He remained in the position of MP for Ross until his death. He returned to active military service during World War I and was wounded twice. Percy Clive was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the Legion of Honour, and the Croix de Guerre, and was mentioned in dispatches twice during his military career. In conclusion, the relationship between Percy Clive and the Conservative Party is that he was initially a member of the Liberal Unionist Party, which formed an alliance and later merged with the Conservative Party. Percy Clive represented the Conservative Party as an MP after the merger and continued to do so until his death."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer is an upcoming American film about Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor who is reported to have killed hundreds of infants born alive during abortion procedures, and convicted of three counts of murder and whom many consider to be a serial killer. Can we infer the following? Kermit Gosnell is both a medical doctor and a convicted murder.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Kermit Gosnell is both a medical doctor and a convicted murderer.  Kermit Gosnell, born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, is a former American physician and abortion provider who became the center of one of the most notorious criminal cases in recent U.S. history. He graduated from Dickinson College in 1963 and subsequently attended Thomas Jefferson University, earning his Medical Degree in 1966. Gosnell specialized in family medicine and eventually focused on providing abortion services at his clinic, Women's Medical Society, which he opened in 1972. However, his clinic soon became infamous for its abysmal conditions and lack of regulatory oversight. Numerous former patients and clinic workers reported that Gosnell routinely performed late-term abortions (beyond the legal limit of 24 weeks in Pennsylvania), along with dangerous, unsanitary, and unethical practices. Gosnell is reported to have killed hundreds of infants born alive during abortion procedures by cutting their spinal cords with scissors, a process he called \\"snipping.\\" The case gained national attention when authorities initiated a drug investigation in 2010 due to suspicions that Gosnell was illegally selling prescription drugs. During a raid on Women's Medical Society, investigators discovered the horrific conditions of the clinic and the full extent of his crimes. They found unsanitary equipment, fetal remains in bags and jars, and evidence of Gosnell's \\"snipping\\" practice. Subsequently, his medical license was suspended, and the clinic was shut down. In 2013, Gosnell was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of three infants born alive during abortions, one count of third-degree murder for the death of a patient who died during a botched abortion, and numerous other charges, including multiple counts of violating Pennsylvania's Abortion Act and performing illegal late-term abortions. Consequently, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The film, \\"Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer,\\" focuses on the life and crimes of Kermit Gosnell, highlighting the controversial aspects of his medical practice, as well as the shocking elements of his serial murders. Through the lens of the film, we can ascertain that Kermit Gosnell is indeed both a medical doctor and a convicted murderer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Yes are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band have undergone numerous formations throughout their history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members. Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Geoff Downes, singer Jon Davison, and bassist Billy Sherwood, with no remaining founding members. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers. In 2001, Yes released their nineteenth studio album Magnification. Recorded without a keyboardist, the album features a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Larry Groupe; the first time the band used an orchestra since Time and a Word in 1970. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the US. The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their two shows in Amsterdam were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release Symphonic Live. The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time.  Following Wakeman's announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their Full Circle Tour in 2002-2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973. The triple compilation album The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection was released in July 2003, reaching number 10 in the UK charts, their highest-charting album since 1991, and number 131 in the US. On 26 January 2004, the film Yesspeak premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group that was released as Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss later on. A 35th anniversary tour followed in 2004 which was documented on the live DVD Songs from Tsongas.  In 2004, Squire, Howe, and White reunited for one night only with former members Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin and Geoff Downes during a show celebrating Horn's career, performing three Yes songs. The show video was released in DVD in 2008 under the name Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm.  On 18 March 2003 minor planet (7707) Yes was named in honour of the band.

Quran Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in Ḥijāzī-type script. The Hijazi style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as Kufic scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore chose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the naskh, muhaqqaq, rayḥānī and, on rarer occasions, the thuluth script. Naskh was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Spain, the Maghribī style was popular. More distinct is the Bihari script which was used solely in the north of India. Nastaʻlīq style was also rarely used in Persian world. Q: Which was the most widely used script by copyists in the 11th century?","output":"The most widely used script by copyists in the 11th century was the Naskh script. It was employed primarily alongside other scripts like muhaqqaq, rayḥānī, and occasionally thuluth script. Naskh was popular due to its simplicity and clarity, which made it easier for copyists to produce copies of the Quran to meet the increasing demand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

City Council considers billboard agreement Neighborhood leaders on L.A.'s Westside responded with fury five years ago after the City Council allowed dozens of digital billboards to go up on Santa Monica Boulevard, Westwood Boulevard and a handful of other major corridors. Now those same activists warn that the council is fast-tracking a behind-the-scenes plan to let those brightly lit signs stay for good — even after a judge struck down the agreement that spawned them. Council members are scheduled Tuesday to decide whether to try to hammer out a new agreement with billboard companies within 30 days, or before an appeals court issues a ruling that could further restrict digital signs. Councilmen Ed Reyes and Paul Krekorian said in their proposal that a new billboard agreement could deliver a \\"significant\\" chunk of digital billboard revenue to the city, money that would then be used to preserve basic services. But billboard foes contend that council members are doing the bidding of the outdoor advertising industry, keeping neighborhood activists in the dark about the planned talks and bypassing the committee where outdoor sign issues are typically vetted. \\"If the council continues down this path … it means all of the digital billboards that exist now are likely to remain and future digital billboards could be developed in exchange for money\\" or other enticements, said Barbara Broide, president of the Westwood South of Santa Monica Blvd. Homeowners Assn. Reyes spokeswoman Monica Valencia said in an e-mail to The Times that neighborhood activists would have an opportunity to weigh in before decisions are made. Meanwhile, Krekorian released a statement saying a new sign agreement could lead to the elimination of a \\"significant portion\\" of the city's billboards. \\"My goal is to see a reduction in all billboards — static and digital,\\" he said. For the last five years, residents in Westwood, Hollywood and elsewhere have complained about digital signs shining into their backyards, living rooms and other private places. Mindy Taylor-Ross, who lives in Venice, said the one on Lincoln Boulevard a block from her home is a source of aggravation. \\"The billboard actually shines into my bedroom window from my bathroom upstairs. I keep thinking the trees will finally block out this invasion of my personal space, and they keep cutting the trees,\\" she said. The fight over digital signs dates back to 2002, when the council approved a law outlawing new billboards except those allowed in special sign districts. The ordinance attracted a handful of legal challenges from billboard companies that claimed, among other things, that the sign inspection fees were too high. In 2006, the council reached a settlement with Clear Channel Outdoor and CBS Outdoor, giving each permission to convert 420 existing billboards to digital formats. That agreement was a \\"sweetheart\\" deal that allowed the two companies to ignore an array of zoning laws — and generate at least 100 million per year, said Phil Recht, a lawyer for Summit Media, a competing advertising company that sued to overturn the agreements. The agreements also gave amnesty to Clear Channel and CBS for any billboard that lacked permits outright, Recht said. \\"It was really one of the more embarrassing recent episodes in L.A. city government, and now they seem poised to do it all over again,\\" he said. In 2009, Summit persuaded a judge to block the council deal, which prevented Clear Channel and CBS from converting more than 700 additional signs to digital formats. But the judge left it to the council to decide what to do about the roughly 100 digital signs already approved. Since then, CBS and Clear Channel have filed an appeal. With opening arguments expected by the end of the month, Clear Channel has urged the city's lawyers to come up with a plan for preserving its existing digital signs — a move that would render the court's previous decision moot. Recht said CBS and Clear Channel were \\"panicked\\" by the possibility that an appeals court would invalidate the roughly 100 digital signs already in operation. He described the Reyes-Krekorian proposal as \\"terribly misleading,\\" in part because it suggests that the city could lose revenue if that happens. \\"It implies that the city has some liability in this litigation, which is absolutely untrue,\\" he said. \\"And it says the window is closing quickly to get money out of these companies, which also isn't the case.\\" Representatives of CBS Outdoor did not respond to calls from The Times. Clear Channel, which has 79 digital signs citywide, said in a statement that a new agreement with the council would benefit residents, businesses and outdoor advertising companies. \\"This motion really represents the opportunity for the city to take control of its own destiny rather than relying on a court to determine the city's outdoor advertising policy,\\" the company's statement said. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the concerns of neighborhood activists in Los Angeles, particularly on the Westside, regarding the City Council's consideration of a new billboard agreement with digital advertising companies.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the user's question - The user is asking about the number of canals in a mandibular first molar. Step 2: Research for an accurate answer  - A mandibular first molar typically has 3 to 4 root canals: 2 mesial canals (mesiobuccal and mesiolingual) and 1 or 2 distal canals (distobuccal and distolingual, with the latter one being less common). Step 3: Analyze the user's proposed answer - The given statement (\\"The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown.\\") seems to describe the general anatomy and position of contacts on a tooth, but does not provide information about the number of root canals in a mandibular first molar.

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018, file photo, adult film actress Stormy Daniels arrives for the opening of the adult entertainment fair \\"Venus,\\" in Berlin. On Monday, Oct. 15, 2018, a federal judge... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge dismissed Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump on Monday, saying the president made a \\"hyperbolic statement\\" against a political adversary when he tweeted about a composite sketch the porn actress' lawyer released.      Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued Trump in April after he said a composite sketch of a man she said threatened her in 2011 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with the real estate mogul was a \\"con job.\\"      Trump tweeted that the man was \\"nonexistent\\" and that Daniels was playing the \\"fake news media for fools.\\" He retweeted a side-by-side photo comparing the sketch with a photo of Daniels' husband.      In an order handed down Monday, U.S. District Judge S. James Otero said Trump's statement was protected speech under the First Amendment.      \\"If this Court were to prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in this type of 'rhetorical hyperbole' against a political adversary, it would significantly hamper the office of the President,\\" the judge wrote. \\"Any strongly worded response by a president to another politician or public figure could constitute an action for defamation. This would deprive this country of the 'discourse' common to the political process.\\"      Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, vowed to appeal the decision and said he was confident it would be reversed.      \\"There is something really rich in Trump relying on the First Amendment to justify defaming a woman,\\" Avenatti said.      But the president's lawyer immediately hailed the ruling as a \\"total victory\\" for Trump.      \\"No amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer, Mr. Avenatti, can truthfully characterize today's ruling in any way other than total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels,\\" Trump's attorney, Charles Harder, said in a statement.      The judge's ruling also entitles Trump to collect attorneys' fees from Daniels, but the amount that Daniels would need to pay will be determined later, Harder said.      The defamation claim is separate from another lawsuit that Daniels filed against Trump, which is continuing. Daniels was paid 130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement signed days before the 2016 election and is suing to dissolve that contract. Daniels has argued the agreement should be invalidated because Trump's then-personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, signed it, but Trump did not.      Lawyers for Trump and Cohen now say the deal that paid Daniels 130,000 to keep quiet was invalid, and they won't sue her for breaking it. Trump's attorney said the president never considered himself as a party to the agreement and doesn't dispute Daniels' assertion that the contract isn't valid.      While Trump and Cohen want the court to toss out the litigation as moot, Daniels' lawyer wants to keep the case alive, hoping to compel Trump to answer questions under oath about what he may have known about the deal.      Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations alleging he coordinated with Trump on a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of Daniels and a Playboy model who alleged affairs.      ___      Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A federal judge has dismissed Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump, stating that the president made a \\"hyperbolic statement\\" against a political adversary when he tweeted about a composite sketch the porn actress' lawyer released.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who was shooed away?, using the article: Yosemite Sam is the royal chef for a spoiled king (a caricature of Charles Laughton, who frequently played kings and similar heads of state).  On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains that the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to both pick up groceries and prepare meals three times every day, but that the king instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam's annoyance (\\"Cook!  Cook! Where's my lunch? Where's my dinner?\\"). This drives Sam to the point where he insults the king behind his back. After Sam prepares the king's latest meal, which consists of \\"Cornish Hen a la Westchester\\" and \\"Prime Rib of Mutton au Jus with kreplach Sauce Bordelaise,\\" the king just kicks the dishes away and orders Sam to take it all away.  He then tells Sam he's fed up with having \\"variety\\" at his meals.  Wanting something different for real, the king orders Sam to fix him some hasenpfeffer.  Sam agrees to carry out the king's request, but doesn't know what hasenpfeffer is.  When Sam checks back just to make sure the king said the right word, the king answers the question by throwing a bowl of custard into Sam's face. Angry at this, Sam again insults the king behind his back (\\"OOH! I hate that honorable royal majestic graciousness!\\"). While Sam is looking up the recipe, Bugs Bunny knocks on the door and explains that as he's one of the rabbits residing in the king's royal forest, he's come to borrow a cup of diced carrots.  Sam just slams the door on Bugs and returns to the cookbook, only to discover that hasenpfeffer is a dish that includes a rabbit as one of the ingredients.  Realizing whom he had just shooed away, Sam rushes out after Bugs. Sam manages to trick Bugs into thinking that the king has invited Bugs for dinner.

Available options:  a). know Sasha  b). ignored  c). be humble Q: Sydney thanked God for Sasha's assistance which really saved her in the nick of time.  Given the context: What will Sasha want to do next? A:","output":"Based on the available options and the context provided, Sasha may want to choose the option c), \\"be humble.\\" Since Sydney has shown gratitude for Sasha's help, it is natural for Sasha to modestly accept the appreciation without boastfulness or arrogance. In this situation, Sasha might feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction after assisting Sydney in a crucial moment. Being humble would entail acknowledging Sydney's gratitude with grace, while not allowing the recognition to inflate their ego or sense of self-worth. This shows a level of maturity, kindness, and wisdom in Sasha's character. To further expand on the potential actions Sasha could take after choosing to be humble, they might: 1. Express gratitude for Sydney's acknowledgment: Sasha could simply say \\"You're welcome\\" or \\"I'm glad I could help,\\" demonstrating that they appreciate Sydney's kind words but are not looking for excessive praise. 2. Share the credit with others: If others were involved in providing assistance to Sydney, Sasha could mention these individuals and highlight their contributions, ensuring that the aid received is recognized as a team effort. 3. Offer more help: One sign of humility is the willingness to continue assisting, even after receiving commendation. Sasha could ask Sydney if there is anything else they can do for them or if they foresee needing help in the future. 4. Encourage others to help one another: Being humble includes a certain level of empathy, so Sasha might take this opportunity to remind everyone of the importance of lending a hand to those in need, helping to create a more supportive environment. 5. Reflect on their actions: A humble person can also use experiences like these to evaluate their personal growth and development, identifying areas in which they can improve and continue to be of service to others. In conclusion, given the context, it's most appropriate for Sasha to be humble in response to Sydney's gratitude for the assistance provided. This humble approach will reflect positively on Sasha's character, while also keeping them grounded and open to continued acts of kindness and support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Animal Planet is an American basic cable and satellite television channel owned by Discovery Communications. Originally focused on more educationally-based television shows, the network has featured more reality programming since 2008. It is available throughout the United States, as well as in over 70 countries around the world. Country-specific versions of the channel have been created in Canada, India, Japan, Taiwan and other countries.  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite.  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - Porphyritic is an adjective used in geology, specifically for igneous rocks, for a rock that has a distinct difference in the size of the crystals, with at least one group of crystals obviously larger than another group. Porphyritic rocks may be aphanites or extrusive, with large crystals or phenocrysts floating in a fine-grained groundmass of non-visible crystals, as in a porphyritic basalt, or phanerites or intrusive, with individual crystals of the groundmass easily distinguished with the eye, but one group of crystals clearly much bigger than the rest, as in a porphyritic granite. Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture. One main type of rock that has a porphyritic texture are porphyry, though not all porphyritic rocks are porphyries.  - Jeffrey Corwin (born July 11, 1967) is an American wildlife biologist and nature conservationist, known as host and executive producer of the Animal Planet cable channel television programs \\"The Jeff Corwin Experience\\" and \\"Corwin's Quest\\".  - The bighorn sheep (\\"Ovis canadensis\\") is a species of sheep native to North America named for its large horns. These horns can weigh up to , while the sheep themselves weigh up to . Recent genetic testing indicates three distinct subspecies of \\"Ovis canadensis\\", one of which is endangered: \\"O. c. sierrae\\". Sheep originally crossed to North America over the Bering land bridge from Siberia: the population in North America peaked in the millions, and the bighorn sheep entered into the mythology of Native Americans. By 1900, the population had crashed to several thousand, due to diseases introduced through European livestock and overhunting.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To determine the most effective solution for removing hard water stains from a faucet, let us examine and compare a few common methods considering naive physics reasoning. 1. Using vinegar and water solution: A solution made from equal parts white vinegar and water is a popular choice for removing hard water stains from a faucet. The mild acidity of vinegar can help dissolve minerals and deposits that hard water leaves behind. From a naive physics perspective, this seems to be an effective method; it is a simple and inexpensive solution that takes advantage of vinegar's natural properties. To use this method, prepare a 1:1 mixture of white vinegar and water and apply it to the stains with a cloth or a sponge. Let it sit for a few minutes and scrub gently to loosen the deposits. Then, rinse with water and dry with a soft cloth. 2. Baking soda and water paste: Another approach is using a paste made from baking soda and water. The baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive that can remove hard water stains without scratching the faucet's surface. To use this method, mix a small amount of baking soda with water (enough to form a paste) and apply it to the hard water stains. Allow the paste to sit for a few minutes, then scrub gently with a sponge or a soft cloth. Rinse with water and dry with a soft cloth. This method also follows naive physics reasoning, as it leverages the physical and chemical properties of baking soda to remove the stains safely and effectively. 3. Lemon juice method: Lemon juice is another natural substance that can help remove hard water stains due to its acidic nature. Cut a lemon in half and rub it directly onto the stain, allowing the juice to work on the deposits for a few minutes. Then, use a soft cloth to gently scrub the stain. Rinse the faucet thoroughly with water and dry it with a soft cloth. Naive physics reasoning aligns with this method, as lemons are a readily available, natural solution for removing stains using their acidity. Comparing these three methods in terms of naive physics reasoning, all of them seem to be viable options for removing hard water stains from a faucet. However, considering factors such as ease of use, effectiveness, and widely available materials, the vinegar and water solution might be considered the most sound solution. Vinegar is a versatile cleaning agent that's effective in addressing a variety of hard water deposit types. It is also inexpensive and easy to work with when compared to the other methods. So, based on naive physics reasoning and practical considerations, the vinegar and water solution appears to be the more sound choice for removing hard water stains from a faucet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

De toute évidence, l'égalité de l'homme et de la femme n'est pas seulement une question de ressources financières; c'est plutôt un problème de choix politique. Translate this to English?","output":"Evidently, the equality between men and women is not just a matter of financial resources; instead, it is a problem of political choice. The concept of gender equality is a multifaceted issue, deeply rooted in societal norms, values, and political decisions that impact both men and women at numerous levels. The statement acknowledges that addressing gender inequality surpasses mere allocation of financial resources to bridge the gap between genders. In contemporary society, achieving gender equality has been a vital topic on national and international agendas. For countries and organizations alike, this issue extends into various domains, including politics. Political choice, in this context, refers to the decisions and policies made by governments and lawmakers, which have the potential either to perpetuate or change the status quo in gender disparities. For instance, political decisions can influence the creation and enforcement of laws that guarantee equal rights for men and women. Policies in education, healthcare, and the labor market can contribute to equal opportunities and access, as well as encouraging more balanced representation among decision-makers. Such political choices can take multiple forms. They can manifest in the form of legal frameworks that outlaw discrimination, electoral reforms that promote equal representation of genders, or affirmative actions incentivizing businesses or institutions to foster diversity. By focusing on these aspects, the statement emphasizes the importance of political will and targeted measures in dismantling ingrained inequalities. However, it should be noted that political choices alone might not suffice in accomplishing lasting gender equality. Public awareness, individual mindsets, and collaborative efforts between governments, communities, and international organizations are equally crucial in fostering substantive and sustainable change. These components, along with purposeful political decisions, can lead to a tangible improvement in gender equality by addressing underlying social, economic, and cultural factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and lived there until the age of nine, when his family moved to Petoskey, in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. He was raised by his father Rasjid and his stepmother Pat, only occasionally visiting his mother, Carrie, in Oregon after she married her second husband Lowell Brams. His mother is deceased. Brams later became the head of Stevens' record label Asthmatic Kitty. In 2011, Dutch concert hall Muziekgebouw Eindhoven commissioned composer Nico Muhly to write a piece. He collaborated with Stevens and Bryce Dessner (of The National) to write a piece about the Solar System, which was first performed in Amsterdam in April 2012. On March 28, 2017, NPR's All Songs Considered reported that Sufjan would team up with Muhly, Dessner, and James McAlister to produce a \\"Planetarium Project\\" album. The first single, \\"Saturn,\\" was released in March 2017 around the announcement that a space-themed Planetarium album would be released June 9, 2017 on 4AD. NPR described the album as \\"collaboration between four brilliant musicians, with lyrics from Sufjan Stevens revolving around mythology, astrology, science, astronomy and the intricacies of human consciousness.\\" The second single, \\"Mercury,\\" was released on April 25, 2017.  In January 2017, it was announced that Stevens would feature original songs written and recorded by himself for the movie Call Me by Your Name, directed by Luca Guadagnino and based on Andre Aciman's novel of the same name. The film was released on November 24, 2017, by Sony Pictures Classics. The soundtrack to the film features two new songs by Stevens. In his review of the film, Consequence of Sound writer Dominick Suzanne-Mayer noted Stevens' score \\"adds to the sensation of the film as an isolated, specific capsule of an unforgettable encounter.\\" One of the original songs is called \\"Visions of Gideon\\", and has been described as fluctuating between lush orchestrations, staccato-heavy piano refrains, and the lilting delivery of \\"I have loved you for the last time\\" in the composition. The trailer for the film features Stevens' song \\"Mystery of Love.\\" Stevens has another track featured in the film: an \\"ethereal piano arrangement\\" of The Age of Adz track \\"Futile Devices.\\" The film has received critical acclaim; on Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 97%, with an average rating of 8.8/10, based on 200 reviews.. In January 2018, Stevens's track \\"Mystery of Love\\" was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song.  On December 6, 2017, Stevens released a new song via Asthmatic Kitty Records' YouTube channel. The track, titled \\"Tonya Harding\\", plays along a clip of the eponymous skater performing at the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships. Two days later, the single was offered for digital download and streaming, to be followed later by a cassette and vinyl release, in two versions, the one featured in the video (subtitled \\"in D major\\") and a slower, piano-only arrangement (\\"in Eb major\\"); in a short essay, Stevens revealed his intention to write a song about Harding since 1991. The track was unrelated to the biographical film I, Tonya, which was released in the same period; nevertheless, Stevens offered it to the film's producers, but was rejected.

In Hama, the Syrian military siege persists A YouTube image grab on July 31 shows what anti-regime protesters say are defected soldiers standing on tanks in Hama. (CNN) -- The military siege on the Syrian city of Hama persisted Thursday as new reports of deaths emerged, including injured people who have passed away in hospitals because they are without electricity, a resident told CNN. The western Syrian city has been at the epicenter of the anti-government movement roiling the country, prompting a push by security personnel to crack down on the huge demonstrations there. Residents reported a breakdown and cutoff in communications and electricity accompanying the siege, and said the military was bombing the city. Speaking to CNN via satellite phone, the resident said entrances of city are blocked, with no one getting in and out and snipers stationed across the city. People who try to leave the city, he said, are being shot. The man said he was sure that about 10 people are dead and dozens of people are injured. However, he said, he is hearing reports of dozens of deaths and said he was told there was \\"genocide\\" in one particular area. Activists have said many civilians may have died as the military and security forces take hold of the city. Witnesses said Wednesday that security forces were brazenly advancing into the heart of Hama. Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. Memories of that siege, carried out by late President Hafez al-Assad, the father of President Bashar al-Assad, have reverberated during the nearly 5-month-old uprising, and the ongoing violence in Hama has prompted international anger against the al-Assad regime. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. But Amnesty International on Thursday cited the Hama siege and slammed the council's response as \\"completely inadequate\\" and \\"limp\\" because it failed to take decisive action. The council issued a presidential statement, which carries no enforcement weight. Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations, said al-Assad has allowed his security forces to carry out another bloody attack on civilians, with dozens killed in the city of Hama in recent days. \\"It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the Security Council has also failed to provide support for such a mission,\\" he said. He notes that Syrian authorities haven't permitted a U.N. fact-finding delegation into the country to investigate the situation. \\"The U.N. must act now, with a firm and legally binding position. At the very least, its position must include imposing an arms embargo, freezing the assets of President al-Assad and other officials suspected of responsibility for crimes against humanity, and referring the situation to the ICC prosecutor,\\" he said, referring to the International Criminal Court. Two permanent members of the Security Council weighed in on how to proceed in the future. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned against outside interference and said the country's citizens should solve their problems themselves, state-run RIA Novosti said. \\"The settlement in this country should be carried out by the Syrians themselves without outside interference and should be based on an all-Syria dialogue, which is the only way to resolve the conflict,\\" the ministry said in a statement. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said earlier Thursday that the Security Council may take a tougher stance on Syria \\"if nothing changes on the Syrian side.\\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, also issued an update about Deir Ezzor, a restive city in the country's northeastern region. It said an opposition leader in the city confirmed a systematic series of government measures to punish residents. They include not submitting salaries to government employees, halting wheat transports to bakeries, preventing hospitals from rescuing injured protesters, and asking governmental medical staff to leave. Pharmacies are closing over fears of detention for giving medications to protesters. Al-Assad has issued a decree authorizing a multiple-party political system, state media reported Thursday. A law was earlier passed by Syrian lawmakers, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported, and grants citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life \\"through peaceful and democratic means.\\" However, the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are simply for show and will not bring about real change. That's because it is questionable whether the move could end decades of single-party Baathist rule without constitutional reform.

In naming compounds, Greek prefixes are used to indicate the number of atoms present for each element. Covalent compounds are written out as molecular formulas due to the fact that each compound is a distinct, separate molecule. Covalent compounds have the first element written out completely while the second element is named with the suffix “ide.” For example, diphosphorus trisulfide has a chemical formula of P2S3. Below are the prefixes for 1-10:  1: Mono- 2: Di- 3: Tri- 4: Tetra- 5: Penta- 6: Hexa- 7: Hepta- 8: Octa- 9: Nona- 10: Deca- When a compound has been written out, you must identify the elements and know their chemical symbols. The first element written is “first name” of the compound. Use the periodic table to find the chemical symbol for the element. For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The first element is nitrogen and the chemical symbol for nitrogen is N. To identify the number of atoms present for each element, you simply need to look at the prefix of the element. Memorizing the Greek prefixes will help you to be able to write chemical formulas quickly without looking anything up.  For example: Dinitrogen has a the prefix “di-“ which means 2; therefore, there are 2 atoms of nitrogen present. Write dinitrogen as N2. The second element is the “last name” of the compound and will follow the first element. For covalent compounds, the element name will have a suffix of “-ide” instead of the normal ending of the element. For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The second element is fluorine. Simply replace the “ide” ending with the actual element name. The chemical symbol for fluorine is F. As you did with the first element, identify the number of atoms present in the second element by reading the prefix. Using this prefix, write the number of atoms as a subscript to the right of the chemical symbol.  For example: Hexafluoride has a prefix of “hexa-“ which means 6; therefore, there are 6 atoms of fluorine present. Write hexafluoride as F6. The final chemical formula for dinitrogen hexafluoride is N2F6. When first learning chemistry, there is a lot of memorization involved. It is kind of like learning a new language. The more examples you practice with, the easier it will be to decipher chemical formulas in the future and learn the language of chemistry.  Sulfur dioxide: SO2  Carbon tetrabromide: CBr4  Diphosphorus pentoxide: P2O5 Summary:","output":"This article teaches us how to name and write chemical formulas for covalent compounds using Greek prefixes, like \\"di-\\" for 2 and \\"hexa-\\" for 6, and the suffix \\"-ide\\" for the second element, so we can understand chemistry better, like how dinitrogen hexafluoride is N2F6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In an effort to boost Uganda's economy, the government has been investing in the agricultural sector by helping farmers afford the farm inputs they need with vouchers and money subsidies. However, the current system often proves to be obsolete, resulting in farmers losing money or using the money for personal purposes or renouncing altogether to the subsidy when faced with the confusing voucher application process. Evelyn Namara, Founder and CEO of Vouch Digital joins CNBC Africa for more. Advertisement","output":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"Ugandan farmers are spending a lot of money to farm\\" is partially true. While the text does not explicitly state that the farmers are spending \\"a lot\\" of money on farming, it does mention that the government is investing in the agricultural sector to help them afford farm inputs. This indicates that the farmers may have to spend a significant amount of money to continue farming, and the government's financial assistance is meant to alleviate their financial burden. However, the text also highlights the inefficiency of the current system. Farmers may lose money or use the government's monetary aid for personal reasons, which suggests that the subsidies may not necessarily translate into a significant increase in the money spent towards farming. In addition, some farmers may entirely renounce the financial support provided due to the confusion surrounding the voucher application process. This means that some farmers may not necessarily be spending a lot of money on farming, despite the government's efforts to support them. In conclusion, although the text suggests that Ugandan farmers may need significant financial assistance for farming-related expenses, the actual spending on farming could be lower due to the inefficiencies and complexities of the government's subsidy program. Thus, the statement might not be entirely true across all the farmers in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Assuming that:  Differences in air pressure over the surface of the Earth result in wind. The greater the differences in air pressures, the stronger the wind. A:","output":"When air pressure differences change very little, the wind generally decreases in strength. This is because wind is generated by differences in air pressure over the Earth's surface. When there is a large difference in air pressure, air moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, creating winds. Conversely, when the differences in air pressure are minimal, the movement of air between high and low-pressure areas becomes weaker, resulting in a decrease in wind strength.

Choices:  - student union - mall - department store - library - town or city  The rationale to choose \\"mall\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The mall is the most suitable choice for her to look for a bookshop after buying the latest fashion. There are several reasons for this: 1. Variety of options: The mall provides a wider variety of options for both fashion and books. There are likely to be multiple clothing stores where she can find the latest fashion trends, and there will typically be at least one large bookshop or several smaller ones. This variety allows her to find everything she needs in one place, making the shopping experience more convenient and enjoyable. 2. Convenience: Malls are designed for a convenient shopping experience. They are typically located in accessible areas and provide ample parking or public transportation options. This means that she can easily access the mall, buy the latest fashion, and then immediately visit the bookshop within the same premises. This saves time and energy compared to visiting separate locations for each item. 3. Comfortable environment: Since malls are indoor shopping centers, they offer a comfortable, climate-controlled environment. This is a significant advantage for shoppers, especially in extreme weather conditions that can make outdoor shopping experiences unpleasant. She can comfortably shop for the latest fashion and visit the bookshop without worrying about rain, snow, or extreme heat. 4. Additional facilities: Malls offer various facilities that make the shopping experience more relaxing and enjoyable. For example, many malls have restaurants, cafes, and seating areas where she can rest and recharge between shopping sessions. There are often restrooms, changing rooms, and other amenities that make it easy for her to try on clothes and find the perfect outfit before heading to the bookshop. 5. Promotions and events: Malls often host various promotions, sales, and events that can benefit shoppers looking for the latest fashion or searching for particular books. She can take advantage of any ongoing sales or special events to snag a great deal on the items she's interested in. In contrast, other options like the student union, department store, library, and town or city don't offer as many advantages. The student union may not have the latest fashion items or the desired bookshop, the department store may lack dedicated bookshops, the library doesn't sell clothing or the latest fashion, and a town or city may require navigation to various locations, which doesn't provide the same level of convenience. Considering all these factors, the mall stands out as the best choice for her to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion, as it offers a range of options, convenience, a comfortable environment, additional facilities, and promotional opportunities, all in one place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have a math problem here: -22*g - 9*g = -217. We need to find the value of \\"g.\\" Let's solve it together step by step: 1. First, let's put together the \\"g\\" terms on the left side. We have -22*g and -9*g. If we add them together, it's like having -22 apples and -9 apples, which is a total of -31 apples. So, -22*g - 9*g = -31*g. 2. Now, our equation looks like this: -31*g = -217. 3. To find what \\"g\\" equals, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -31. This is like sharing -217 candies equally among -31 friends.  4. So, g = -217 / -31. 5. When you divide a negative number by another negative number, the result is a positive number. So, -217 divided by -31 equals 7. 6. That means g = 7. Good job!

Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.  and a hint : Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.  Please answer this question : Which researcher studied less about abrasion? The answer to this question is:","output":"Manny studied less about abrasion than Danny. This is because Manny researched environments that have never been glaciated, while Danny focused on glaciated environments. In glaciated environments, which Danny studied, abrasion is a significant process that occurs due to the movement of glaciers over the underlying rock. The friction between the ice and the rock surface causes the rock to be worn down and creates fine sediment known as glacial flour. Additionally, the debris transported by the glaciers, such as rocks and sediments, is left behind as moraines when the ice recedes. These glacial processes, including abrasion, contribute to the formation of U-shaped valleys in glaciated landscapes. On the other hand, Manny's research on non-glaciated environments would have involved studying different geomorphic processes that shaped those landscapes, such as fluvial or hillslope processes. While paraglacial processes may still be present in non-glaciated environments, they are not directly related to glacial abrasion and are instead a result of past glaciation. The formation of V-shaped valleys in non-glaciated areas is primarily driven by fluvial erosion, which is different from the glacial erosion responsible for U-shaped valleys. As a result, Manny's research focused less on the process of abrasion compared to Danny's since he was examining non-glaciated environments where the direct impact of glacial abrasion would not have played a significant role in shaping the landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Molly bolts are the strongest of your options, holding up to 100 pounds (45 kg) in straight drywall. A molly consists of a screw and a sleeve. The sleeve flays out against the backside of drywall to create a wide base of support. You will need a drill to install a molly bolt. Attach the bit that matches the size of your molly bolt. Remember that molly bolts create large holes in your wall, so choose your placement carefully. If you are using 2 molly bolts, predetermine how far apart you need them to be according to the size of your item. Use a tape measure to make the two marks the correct distance apart. Double check that the 2 marks are in line either using a leveler or by measuring down from the ceiling.  If the item you’ll be hanging has a wire hanger on the back, be sure to consider the length of the slack. You can test this by pulling the center of the wire tight toward the top of your object. Measure from the bottom of the object to where the wire catches. Keep the bit perpendicular to the floor. Use the same size bit as the bolt. For example, if you chose a 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) bolt, use a 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) bit. Place the molly bolt, the screw and the sleeve together, into the hole you’ve drilled.

During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet \\"God is our Refuge\\", K. 20, and the tenor aria Va, dal furor portata, K. 21. A:","output":"Bach"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who plays the character that the business partner of Nita's boyfriend is trying not to be seen by? , can you please find it?   On an ocean liner sailing from the Orient to San Francisco, Mei Lei Ming gives fellow passenger Nita Kenton a reading. When Nita's boyfriend, importer Phillip Corey, scoffs at her predictions, she informs him that he himself will die within 48 hours. Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton, however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows (an uncredited Sidney Bracey), who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe. Mei Lei becomes suspicious. When the letters Gow wanted are later examined, Mei Lei discovers a coded message that indicates Corey and Gow were involved in drug smuggling.

The like terms are the terms with the same variable (i.e., n). Step 1: Combine like terms 1443 = -150*n + 97*n - 836 The like terms are -150*n and 97*n. Adding these two terms together, we get: -150*n + 97*n = -53*n So, the equation becomes: 1443 = -53*n - 836 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (n) To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term on the right side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 836 to both sides of the equation: 1443 + 836 = -53*n - 836 + 836 This simplifies to: 2279 = -53*n Step 3: Solve for n Now, to find the value of n, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -53: 2279 / (-53) = (-53*n) / (-53) This results in: n = -43 So, the solution to the equation is n = -43."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles’ child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family. Although I mentioned this to my “so called” lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled. After all these and after having me pushed into loosing my otherwise strong case, I was sentenced with restriction order to my own home, loosing all I had paid for it, loosing my stuff inside home, aforced probation and a forced domestic violence course for no good reason, my so called bloody lawyer also sent to the court a paper indicating that I owed to him and never had paid his dues.

Wenger said it was 'impossible' to prepare his squad properly for the upcoming Premier League campaign, which begins on August 16, given the demands of their pre-season schedule and players returning later than normal after World Cup duty. VIDEO Scroll down for US Tour not good for United - Van Gaal. Team talk: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger chats with former Gunner Thierry Henry during a training session at Red Bull Arena. Arsenal are in the United States for a friendly against Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise New York Red Bulls, before heading to Austria for a training camp and then returning to London for the Emirates Cup. 'These training camps in the modern game are decided for commercial reasons and because of the extent of popularity of the club,' the Frenchman told a news conference on Thursday. 'We've never been to the States before and I was very happy to come to New York - a city I love. 'But for purely football reasons, the best thing to do is stay and not travel too much because of the time you waste and the jet-lag you suffer is not ideal.' Worry: Wenger is concerned about the effects of travel on his players in run-up to new season. Arsenal are without a host of internationals following the World Cup and Wenger highlighted the difficulty in players beginning the intense domestic campaign so soon after returning from the tournament. 'This season is a post-World Cup year and very difficult because the time is very short between the final, which was on July 13, and the start of the new season on August 16. 'And compulsory, from FIFA, you are obliged to give four weeks' holiday to the players, so I don't know how all that works together. It looks, to me, impossible.' Wenger's comments came days after Van Gaal said Manchester United's pre-season tour was wrongly being dictated by the club's commercial interests. Commitment: Kriss Olsson and Issac Hayden take part in training session in New Jersey on Thursday. United beat Los Angeles Galaxy 7-0 on Wednesday, and now face games in Denver, Washington and Detroit. Van Gaal's team potentially face a fifth game on August 4, less than two weeks before they kick off their Premier League season at home to Swansea City on August 16.

Summarize the following: If you enjoy the outdoors and working with your hands you may want to try your hand at agriculture.  Make sure that you plan for winter and summer months to keep your business in practice.  This could mean lawn care in the summer and snow shoveling in winter.  You could also consider painting houses and general maintenance. If you have a passion for animals, there are plenty of people who work long hours and need help caring for their pets.  Look into starting a dog walking and pet sitting business.  Dog walking is a consistent job needed on a daily basis.  Consider involving a friend to assist you should you be sick or unavailable.  Pet Sitting can be a boost of your income on an irregular basis. Working FOR yourself doesn’t necessarily mean working BY yourself.  You may have fantastic people skills which you could put to work caring for others.  This could mean child care, but there are also plenty of elderly people who could also benefit from your assistance and your company. There is a good chance that you are more skilled with computers than the aging owners of your local businesses.  Jobs requiring your technological skills could span from setting up software to organizing digital files to creating websites.  Make an online presence for yourself by creating your own website which showcases your skills. Artists don’t have to starve.  Jobs abound for graphic artists if you are capable of transferring this skill to the computer.  If not, look for work designing posters for local bands or businesses.  See if you can get some of your work into a local gallery or public space like a coffee shop or restaurant, and place a placard next to each print with the title and purchase price.  Make sure the business owner has your contact information to facilitate the sale.  Their assistance is worth a percentage of the sale.  This should be agreed upon as part of the agreement before hanging your work. Writers can submit work to online and print magazines.  There are also plenty of options to work freelance as a blogger or content creator for businesses.  Take the work you have already created and send it to publishers seeking content which relate to your style or topic.  Seek out businesses attempting to increase marketing and offer to blog for them or even write content for their promotional material.  You will need to understand the company, their mission, their style, and their audience on order to represent them accordingly. Who would have thought that all that time you “wasted” on Facebook and Instagram could really pay off?  Well, it literally can.

By Leon Watson Last updated at 2:38 PM on 9th January 2012 A cargo ship grounded off the New Zealand coast since October has split in two, spilling sea containers and debris and sparking fears of a fresh oil spill, maritime officials said. The wreck of the Greek-owned Rena was described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster even before the rear section of the ship, lashed by pounding seas, broke away yesterday. The ship previously spilled heavy fuel oil that fouled pristine North Island beaches and killed up to 20,000 seabirds, and despite salvage efforts nearly 400 tons of oil remain onboard.

Authorities and environmental organizations worked diligently to remove the remaining oil from the wreck and mitigate the environmental damage. Salvage teams took advantage of favorable weather conditions to extract as much oil as possible and to remove the remaining containers from the ship. In the following months, with the cooperation of local communities and government agencies, extensive cleanup efforts took place to restore the affected beaches and wildlife habitats. This ending was chosen because it is geographically accurate considering the Rena was grounded off the New Zealand coast, and it emphasizes the cooperative efforts of various stakeholders to address the environmental disaster and its consequences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname \\"Cottonopolis\\" due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.

How to prepare for a tourette syndrome diagnosis  Examine your family history.  Since tourette syndrome is genetic, ask yourself, \\" have any relatives experienced symptoms? \\" sometimes, tourette syndrome appears to arise spontaneously without any family history of the condition. Therefore, someone might have the genes, but not experience any symptoms. OPT: [I] The only reason why someone might experience symptoms are if genetic gene testing results are positive for the condition. Find out if anyone with the gene and the condition has had difficulties finding a sponsor.. [II] This is called' shadow tourette syndrome'. Whether or not relatives have experienced symptoms does not influence the outcome of a diagnosis, but is helpful information for the doctor to have.. [III] Evaluate whether symptoms persist after various treatments. It is common for tourette syndrome to recur longer than all family members are affected.. [IV] Before you can diagnose your family history, you need to identify the person. For example, a relative could have witnessed someone act like a stick figure, but not experience any symptoms that brought about the diagnosis.. Answer:","output":"II This is called 'shadow Tourette syndrome'. Whether or not relatives have experienced symptoms does not influence the outcome of a diagnosis, but it is helpful information for the doctor to have. If no one in your family has ever been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, it is still possible that you or your relatives could be carrying the gene, although it has never manifested in observable symptoms. In such cases, the gene could be passed down through generations without ever coming to the forefront. In order to provide your doctor with the most accurate information possible, it is important to have conversations with your relatives about their own experiences or to search for any known documentation about possible Tourette-related symptoms. This may include discussing any occurrences of tics, sudden vocal outbursts, or repetitive, involuntary movements that have been previously dismissed or overlooked in your family history. Additionally, consider documenting the onset of your own symptoms, the frequency and severity, as well as any factors that seem to trigger or worsen them. Keeping a journal of your observations could provide valuable information to your doctor, making it easier to identify the presence of Tourette syndrome and distinguish it from other neurological or psychiatric conditions that might express similar symptoms. After gathering all available information on your family history and your own symptomatology, it is essential to consult a medical professional with expertise in neurological disorders like Tourette syndrome. They will review the data you provide, perform a thorough examination, and may request additional tests and evaluations to rule out other conditions before reaching a conclusive diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. Upon receiving a diagnosis, it is important to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. While there is no cure for Tourette syndrome, there are various treatment options available to help manage the symptoms. These options could include medication, behavioral therapy, or alternative treatments like relaxation techniques, depending on the severity of your symptoms and your unique needs. In conclusion, preparing for a Tourette syndrome diagnosis involves examining your family history, documenting your own symptoms and their triggers, consulting a qualified medical professional, and actively participating in discussions about available treatment options. By taking these steps, you can help ensure a comprehensive understanding of the condition and its impact on your life, enabling you and your health care team to create a personalized and effective treatment plan to manage your symptoms."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Here is an article: The last time the Galaxy failed to score in successive games was in May 2012, during the strange somnambulant period they went through after winning the 2011 MLS Cup. And coming into Sunday night’s home game against Seattle Sounders, the champion Galaxy were coming off two straight defeats without scoring and looking at best indifferent in the early season running. So in many ways the visit of Seattle, the team who along with LA have been the best regular season performers since 2009, could not have been timed worse – particularly with Robbie Keane missing, and their attacking hopes mainly resting on the rather less subtle charms of Alan “Snowshoes” Gordon, in his 200th MLS appearance. And as the Sounders, themselves missing Clint Dempsey, but boasting the in-form Obafemi Martins, spent the opening 20 minutes forcing LA keeper Jaime Penedo into save after acrobatic save, it looked very much as if the hosts were in danger of falling to their first home defeat to the Sounders in 10 games. Lamar Neagle in particular must have been left wondering what he had to do to score against Penedo, as the LA shot stopper, while at the other end Seattle’s midfield and defense seemed well set up to cope with the somewhat rudimentary threat of Gordon the target man. Rudimentary, but effective, that is. Just after another Penedo full-stretch parry, Gordon opened the scoring with a point-blank header. It was perhaps a fitting way for Gordon to celebrate his unlikely run to 200 appearances. He is not a man to replicate the close quarters subtlety of Keane, but as an outlet when the Galaxy need to force something, he is nothing if not forceful. In truth neither side looked at their incisive best, as what was billed as a marquee game drifted for long stretches in the late afternoon sun, with occasional surges of excitement for another save by the impressive Penedo. It was perhaps telling that one of the biggest cheers of the second-half came when the visiting David Beckham was shown on the big screen. Gordon had once welcomed Beckham to LA by holding on to his handshake a beat too long in the Englishman’s inaugural visit to his new locker room and asking, “And you are…?” It was a typical moment of irreverence from a proud journeyman who was here before the start of the designated player era and who against the odds has managed to survive and even thrive in the interim. And in game 200, he won a game between the best two teams of that era. There’ll doubtless be higher profile games between these two teams later in the year, but Gordon deserved his moment. GP Orlando City have already shown they’re capable of producing a few exemplary moments in order to grind out a fortuitous result on the road – see their 2-2 comeback draw against the Montreal Impact last month. In fact, the expansion club have yet to lose on the trot. Here too Adrian Heath’s team did what they needed to produce a 0-2 win against a Portland Timbers team that is slouching towards May (though luck and some, erm, “bold” refereeing helped things along), and in doing so revealed a few bright spots. Brek Shea in particular looks like he’s owning that left-back position, working out the skilful balance between attack and defense. Kevin Molino, despite some hesitancy here and there, was influential in the final third and produced a smart assist for Cyle Larin with a nice cross in the 30th minute. And Larin, the soon-to-be 20 year old Canadian Generation Adidas wunderkind who chested in the winner, may or may not have seen it coming but made it look intentional and was otherwise worthy of a start with a few good chances. Though Orlando were hardly dominant, they were good for the win. For Portland though this was a hot mess. Hot in the sense that despite their 1-2-3 record, they are still clearly a threat where it counts. Darlington Nagbe looked dangerous on the counter, Fanendo Adi managed six shots and was able to move well in front of goal, and Dairon Asprilla looked to have scored the equalizer in the 72nd minute until Donovan Ricketts made an incredible diving save. Nothing resulted in a Timbers goal, though, and the idea that all will be well when Diego Valeri comes back is starting to sound like something out of Waiting for Godot (or Guffman). But Portland were also a mess. Diego Chara somehow only received a yellow for tackling the last man Kevin Molino on the centre circle in the 45th minute as he was about to receive a gorgeous through pass. Then Timbers keeper Adam Kwarasey made the interesting decision to swat the legs of Carlos Rivas in the 85th minute with a point still very much in the offing for his club. Kwarasey appeared to have atoned with a world class save from Kaká from the spot, and yet Kevin Stott ordered a retake when Chara, for some reason, encroached on the area. If ever there was a mascot for 2015 Portland, it isn’t Timber Joey, but rather their morose, scarf-draped coach Caleb Porter looking on from the sidelines. RW A week after starring in a Regency drama over a discarded tissue opposite Portland’s Caleb Porter, Dallas coach Oscar Pareja found himself welcoming 19th-century villain Pablo Mastroeni and his unfeasibly waxed mustache to Toyota Stadium. Pareja must be wishing he’d stayed in the era when his team routinely won games (which going on recent seasons’ evidence we’ll call simply “March”), after his former team’s young players ended a record-equaling winless streak in emphatic fashion by blowing away Dallas in front of their own fans. As we noted last week, time seemed to be running out for Colorado’s kids to come good on their promise as they equalled a decade-old league winless streak record held by Rocky Mountain rivals Real Salt Lake, while still waiting to score their first goal of the season. And with Dallas th hosts after their blip against Portland, most neutrals would have been putting money on the Rapids holding that winless record outright after Friday’s nationally televised game. Instead, after waiting over 600 minutes for a goal, Colorado went ahead with their first of the season after just two minutes, and by the time the final whistle had blown, they’d added three more, with substitute Dillon Serna capping the display with a peach of a goal late on. It was as emphatic as it was unexpected, and in one fell swoop transformed the complexion of Colorado’s start – having kept Dallas out at the other end, the Rapids can now point to having conceded (and lost) in only one of their five games so far, and to have denied the speed and movement of a formidable looking Dallas offense in completing the latest instalment. It would have been no disgrace to concede to this Dallas attack, but having built a defensive platform Mastroeni must have at least hoped for a goal for his team to build on from this game. To score four, unanswered, is a quantum leap for his side, and you have to wonder what effect that can now have on the Rapids’ season, and indeed that of Dallas. Of course seemingly aberrant results can happen at any time in parity-obsessed MLS, but the flip side of that is that there are few easy games for confidence-starved teams to break streaks such as those Colorado have been on (it’s perhaps telling that their last win was against Chivas USA towards the end of that team’s doomed tenure in MLS). To do so against the coach who’d walked out on them must have been an additional pleasure for the Colorado players. That same coach, Pareja, won plaudits last year for the way he retooled his team after what could have been the devastating loss of Mauro Diaz early in the campaign. Compared to that challenge, lifting his team after two consecutive defeats shouldn’t be beyond Pareja, but this has been a week that’s had him reaching for the tissues. GP Why not book the Guardian MLS writing team for your next motivational speaking gig? Not only did we inspire Colorado’s kids to grow up this week, but we took Philadelphia from late game “incompetence” last time out to inspiration this weekend, as the team won their first game of the season through an injury time winner against New York City FC. Fair’s fair and credit may partly be due to the Union themselves, and in particular coach Jim Curtin and his decision to act decisively in dropping expensive goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi this week. Mbolhi had arrived last year being hailed as a coup of a signing by Union CEO Nick Sakiewicz, who had made much of Mbolhi’s appearances at the World Cup, and rather less mention of what’s been a checkered club career. Since arriving, Mbolhi has made a number of high-profile errors, including another awkward one in last week’s loss to Sporting KC, and this week Curtin had seen enough – telling the keeper to basically go home and clear his head with an indefinite timetable for his return. And as Mbolhi took the first flight to France, Curtin turned to local goalkeeper and Union supporter John McCarthy, who had been playing for Rochester Rhinos as Mbolhi appeared in Brazil, to take his place. In the event it wasn’t a complete fairy tale rise for McCarthy, who had to pick the ball out of the net in a strained second-half period for Philadelphia that saw David Villa walk an equalizer into the net, and New York City threaten to roll over their opponents. But a couple of late saves and an otherwise solid enough performance, combined with Vincent Nogueira poking home an injury-time winner at the other end, did mean that McCarthy got to walk off the field with a big hug from Curtin, and in front of home fans celebrating their first win of 2015. It was an important win for Curtin, after the gut punch of Sporting’s two injury-time goals last week, and one that added some extra spice to the return game between the two sides at Yankee Stadium this Thursday night. Certainly it shifted the emphasis of the questions asked of Jason Kreis post-game, as he lamented the late lapse in concentration that saw a long ball being allowed to bounce in the build up to Philly’s winner, but mainly expressed concern at yet another slow start from his team in a second consecutive loss. It’s clearly a preoccupying issue for the emerging New York City team. Visitors to the locker room after the match were greeted by the sight of the pre-game whiteboard emblazoned with the question, “Can we get out to a really aggressive, committed, confident start today?” They didn’t, and the second half flurry that brought the equalizer was not typical of their performance. Maybe they should book the very reasonable Guardian motivational team before Thursday night … GP It’s tempting to compare the Montreal Impact – both Concacaf Champions League finalists and the last-place team in the Eastern Conference following a 3-0 loss to the Houston Dynamo - to other sides which famously excelled in the cups whilst bumbling in the league. Wigan in 2013, able to defeat Manchester City to win the FA Cup but not to stay in the Premier League. Liverpool in 2005, winners of the European Cup and fifth-place finishers in the English top flight, the first to force Uefa to change the rules over Champions League qualifying. Yet the comparisons don’t quite stand up under scrutiny. Despite advancing over two legs in both the CCL quarters and semis against Mexican side Pachuca and Costa Rica’s Alajuelense respectively, in all four matches Frank Klopas’ counterattacking Impact only managed a single, bona fide win: a 2-0 win at the Olympic Stadium in their home semi-final. In fact, that game stands as their only victory in all eight of their eight competitive matches in 2015. The Montreal Impact, despite a historic opportunity to become the first MLS and Canadian team to win the Concacaf Champions League, are nevertheless decidedly mediocre both midweek and weekends. For now, perhaps. Despite conceding three goals to the Dynamo, Montreal were, at least for one or two spells, unmistakably dominant. Andres Romero looked sharp on the ball,­ Dilly Duka was menacing in the early going, Jack McInerney displayed brief glimpses of his old self … Montreal finished the game having outshot, out-passed and out-possessed Owen Coyle’s Dynamo. Houston might say with confidence that letting Montreal have the ball was all part of the plan (Impact defender Laurent Ciman told the press after the match he would have preferred to concede the ball and win than play beautifully and lose). Having conceded in the 15th minute of play, the Impact had no choice in the final stages but to push up and risk a drubbing, which they did courtesy of Ricardo Clark’s nifty run in the box (72nd minute) and the rookie substitute Rob Lovejoy’s wonderful hit (80th). And yet at least the elements of a team perhaps substantially better than the one which finished last overall in 2014 are there. We will get a better picture when the Impact fly to the Azteca for the first leg of the CCL final against America on 22 April.

There's a certain allure I've always found in discovering the great (semi-) unknown film. These discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown sci-fi, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found \\"High Tide\\" on video at a junk store, mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality. Of course, that's the only place I would find it, as it is still not on DVD. While I was watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the course of this film, I was somehow certain I was watching a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I had previously seen Davis in several small parts - and one starring role in \\"A Passage to India\\". But, although she was superb in the aforementioned film, \\"High Tide\\" is a different animal entirely. Since recently watching Gillian Armstrong's later film, \\"Charlotte Gray\\", I was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her. Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensibility. Judy Davis' performance is stunning, I cannot say enough good things about it. She shares an amazing on-screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), this film's other great actress. There's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together, the details of which I won't presume to reveal here (see it for yourself!). There's too much good in \\"High Tide\\" to cover in one review. Indeed, I would hardly care to - the film speaks well enough for itself.

Operating in the exciting price range of less than £20, it serves as an attractive option for those seeking authentic Japanese flavors without causing a significant dent in their wallets. The presentation of dishes is fundamentally underpinned by the fundamental principles of Japanese culinary artistry, with each offering perfectly balancing flavors and textures. This, combined with an appealing ambience that blends contemporary style with traditional elements, provides a memorable culinary experience for every diner.  However, it is important to note that The Vaults is not specifically targeted towards families with young kids. The environment and setting are more aligned with adult tastes, ranging from casual friend gatherings to professional meetings. The absence of a kid-friendly zone or play area means that the noise level is often lower and the atmosphere mature, implying that it is not suitable for a children-centered outing. Additionally, a more sophisticated menu can be found here, which might not be tailored to younger palates.

I write this in an attempt to explain it to those who already saw the movie. John (Scott Adkins) seems to wake up from a coma, after 9 months - or so he is told - still freshly remembering how a guy named Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) brutally killed his family. The truth however is that this John is a new clone, with implanted memories of a non-existent family. Obviously, also the killing did never happen. An FBI agent (Rus Blackwell) has some \\"questions\\" for John as soon as he wakes up, showing him a photo of the killer and providing John with a name. The objective of this all is to make John think he has free will and make him want to hunt down and kill Deveraux. Deveraux is wanted badly by the government because he's running an underground organisation that frees clones like John from the government and gives them the truth and gives them back their free will by removing any false memories they might have. When John goes out exploring he meets people that he never saw before (obviously, he was just born) but who seem to recognize him. At this point we don't know much of the background story yet, so it's a real mystery when we learn on a few occasions that John apparently can be very violent. First we hear from his ex-girl friend that he once beat a man half-to-death in front of the club where she works (which is why he isn't welcome anymore there), then we meet a guy in some storage building who looks awfully deformed with scares, which apparently is the work of John and reveals that John killed a good friend of himself! At last John finds his former clone, and things become more clear: the previous John had been sent on the same mission - albeit without the false memories about having a family. This John has been freed by Deveraux and worked for him for a while, until he felt he was now the slave of Deveraux instead of the government and left him. Meanwhile Deveraux and his recruits are also hunting John, thinking he is...

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Domenikos Theotokopoulos (Greek: Domenikos Theotokopoulos [do'minikos theoto'kopulos]; 1541 -  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Domenikos Theotokopoulos (Domenikos Theotokopoulos), often adding the word Kres (Kres, \\"Cretan\\"). El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. In 1577, El Greco migrated to Madrid, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works. At the time, Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city with \\"an illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain future\\". In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain art critics. During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II of Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it. Titian was dead, and Tintoretto, Veronese and Anthonis Mor all refused to come to Spain. Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Juan Fernandez de Navarrete, of whose gravedad y decoro (\\"seriousness and decorum\\") the king approved. However, Fernandez died in 1579; the moment should have been ideal for El Greco.  Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; Pedro Chacon, a clergyman; and Luis de Castilla, son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo. El Greco's friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo. He arrived in Toledo by July 1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for the renowned El Espolio. By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo, including The Trinity and The Assumption of the Virgin. These works would establish the painter's reputation in Toledo.  El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice. However, the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had. what did he do in toledo?","output":"In Toledo, El Greco secured his first large commissions, including a group of paintings that adorned the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the renowned El Espolio.

Oni razvijaju veštine koje su neophodne za interkulturalnu saradnju i rešavanje problema. 4. Unapređivanje znanja o drugim zemljama i kulturama: Učenici kroz interkulturalnu razmenu imaju priliku da nauče o istoriji, geografiji, umetnosti i drugim aspektima drugih kultura. Ovo proširuje njihova znanja i razumevanje sveta. 5. Povezivanje škola i stvaranje partnerstava: Interkulturalne razmene mogu doprineti stvaranju dugoročnih partnerskih odnosa između škola. Ovo može dovesti do saradnje na drugim projektima, kao što su zajednički istraživački radovi ili organizovanje međunarodnih događaja. 6. Razvoj građanskog angažmana: Interkulturalne razmene podstiču učenike da budu aktivni građani i da se uključe u svoje zajednice. Razmena ideja, vrednosti i iskustva može inspirisati učenike da se angažuju u borbi za prava i promovisanje jednakosti.

Cependant, il est possible de dire que certains colons peuvent avoir eu des préoccupations quant à former rapidement des cadres supérieurs au sein de la population autochtone ou colonisée. Dans certains cas de colonisation, les puissances coloniales ont souvent eu pour objectif d'exploiter les ressources naturelles ou économiques des colonies, sans nécessairement investir dans l'éducation ou la formation des populations locales. Cela a pu entraîner un déséquilibre des pouvoirs au profit des colons, qui étaient souvent ceux qui détenaient les positions de pouvoir et de leadership. Former une élite nationale pourrait être perçu comme une menace par les colons, car cela pourrait potentiellement remettre en question leur propre domination et autorité. En empêchant la formation rapide de cadres supérieurs parmi la population autochtone ou colonisée, les colons pourraient maintenir un contrôle politique et économique plus fort. Cependant, il est important de noter que cela ne s'applique pas à tous les contextes de colonisation, car les motivations et les politiques coloniales variaient considérablement d'une colonie à l'autre. Certains colons ont pu promouvoir l'éducation et la formation de la population autochtone pour des raisons économiques, politiques ou morales. La question de la formation d'une élite nationale est donc complexe et dépend du contexte spécifique de la colonisation en question."},{"instruction":"Tell me about all voice assistant features and things that I have to realize in my project with voice assistant","output":"Voice assistants have a wide range of features and capabilities that can significantly enhance user experience in your project.

Intellectual Property: All materials and content provided by VRC are intellectual property and are protected by copyright laws.

VRC and its representatives shall not be held legally liable for any financial losses or negative outcomes resulting from such decisions. 13. Refund Clause: In the event that the service provided by VRC is not as agreed upon or does not meet the Client’s standards, the Client may be eligible for a refund of up to 50% of the deposit. Upon refund completion, the contract will terminate; with the exception of all surviving clauses. 14. Surviving Clauses: Upon termination or expiration of this Contract, the following clauses shall survive and continue to be binding upon the Parties: - Intellectual Property - Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) - Non-Defamation Agreement - Legal Fees - Waiver of Objections - Severability Clause - Indemnification Clause - Entire Agreement Clause 15. Force Majeure Clause: In the event of unforeseen circumstances or events beyond the control of either party, including but not limited to natural disasters, war, terrorist acts, pandemics, government actions, strikes, labor disputes, or any other events considered force majeure, the affected party will be relieved from performing its obligations under this Contract for the duration of such events or may request an extension of time as necessary. - The party invoking the force majeure event must notify the other party promptly in writing, providing details of the event and its impact on their ability to fulfill their obligations under the Contract. - The affected party will make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the force majeure event and resume performance as soon as reasonably possible. - If the force majeure event exceeds a period of [specified time period], either party may terminate the Contract by providing written notice to the other party.

The parties should negotiate and agree upon the details of the force majeure clause to ensure fairness and clarity. 16. Entire Agreement Clause: This Contract represents the entire agreement between VRC and the Client and supersedes any prior discussions, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter herein. Any contradictory or additional terms from other sources, including but not limited to emails or verbal statements, are null and void unless agreed upon in writing by both Parties. No modification, alteration, or amendment to this Contract shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. 17.

Both parties acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to act in good faith in accordance with this clause. They further acknowledge that acting in good faith is a fundamental principle in maintaining a positive and productive working relationship. By signing below, the Parties hereby understand and agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Tutoring Contract. VRC Representative (Printed Name) Client (Printed Name) VRC Representative (Signature) Client (Signature) Date: _______________________ Date: ______________________","output":"This tutoring contract establishes an agreement between VRC (the tutor or tutoring company) and the client (the individual or entity receiving tutoring services). The contract covers various aspects of the tutoring services, including the scope of services, method of communication, pricing and payment, services provided, indemnification, non-disclosure and non-defamation agreements, legal fees, contract amendments, intellectual property, disclaimer, refund clause, surviving clauses, force majeure clause, entire agreement clause, and the requirement to act in good faith. Both parties must sign the contract to acknowledge their understanding and agreement to the terms and conditions outlined within. The contract also includes spaces for printed names and dates of signing."},{"instruction":"Can you inform me of any updates I need to make to the first terms of definitions?","output":"Based on the initial terms and definitions in the provided tutoring contract, no specific updates or changes are needed. The definitions are clear and accurately reflect the parties involved in the contract. The contract states that VRC refers to the tutor's name or company name, while the Client refers to the individual or entity receiving tutoring services. These definitions are sufficient and provide clarity for both parties."},{"instruction":"Do these definitions reflect the terms used in later parts of the contract as well?","output":"Yes, the definitions provided in the initial terms are consistent and aligned with the terms used throughout the rest of the contract. For example, in later parts of the contract, terms such as \\"VRC\\" and \\"Client\\" are consistently used to refer to the tutor or tutoring company and the individual or entity receiving tutoring services, respectively. The use of these defined terms maintains consistency and clarity in the contract, ensuring that both parties understand their roles and obligations."},{"instruction":"Do certain components need to be in all caps?","output":"In the provided tutoring contract, there is no specific requirement for certain components to be in all caps. The use of all caps is a formatting choice that can be made to highlight certain terms or sections of the contract. However, it's important to note that using all caps excessively throughout the contract may make it harder to read and could increase the risk of misunderstanding. It is generally recommended to use caps sparingly, such as for section headings or important terms, to enhance clarity and navigability. Ultimately, the use of all caps is a matter of preference and should be used judiciously to serve the purpose of the contract effectively."},{"instruction":"what are the typical fonts and font sizes for contracts","output":"When it comes to choosing fonts and font sizes for contracts, it is important to prioritize readability and professionalism. Here are some commonly used fonts and font sizes for contracts: 1. Fonts: - Times New Roman - Arial - Calibri - Helvetica - Garamond 2. Font Sizes: - Body text: 10-12 point - Section headings: 14-16 point (bold or uppercase for emphasis) - Subheadings or important sections: 12-14 point (bold or italicized for emphasis) The font size may vary depending on the length and complexity of the contract. It is crucial to ensure that the font chosen is clear and easily legible. Additionally, maintaining consistency in font style and size throughout the contract helps to maintain a professional appearance."},{"instruction":"Is the contract amendments and entire agreement clause in direct conflict with each other as both talk about superseding contracts?","output":"The contract amendments clause and the entire agreement clause might seem contradictory at first glance, both discussing the superseding of previous agreements. However, they serve different purposes and can coexist in a contract. The contract amendments clause allows for changes to be made to the contract in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. This provision ensures that any modifications or alterations to the existing contract are properly documented and agreed upon by both parties. On the other hand, the entire agreement clause states that the current contract represents the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior discussions, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral, related to the subject matter. This clause is typically included to prevent any misunderstanding or ambiguity that may arise from previous agreements or negotiations. While the entire agreement clause asserts that the current contract is the complete and final agreement between the parties, the contract amendments clause acknowledges the potential need for modifications or changes to be made to that agreement in the future. Therefore, these clauses can coexist without creating direct conflict."},{"instruction":"Does VRC need to state if they are found liable they will only be held liable to the maximum of the law?","output":"While it is not explicitly stated in the provided contract, it is generally advisable for a party, such as VRC, to include a clause limiting their liability to the extent permitted by the law. A limitation of liability clause seeks to protect a party from excessive or unforeseen damages that may arise from their performance or non-performance under the contract. Including such a clause can help prevent potential disputes over liability and provide clarity to both parties. However, the specific language and scope of the limitation of liability clause can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the services being provided. To ensure the limitation of liability clause is enforceable and in compliance with applicable laws, it is recommended consulting with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the jurisdiction and relevant legal requirements."},{"instruction":"Does my indemnity clause cover this already?","output":"Yes, the indemnification clause in the provided contract serves to protect VRC and its contractors or private employees from any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses arising from the Client's use of the tutoring services and their investment decisions. It places the responsibility on the Client to bear the risks associated with their investment decisions and releases VRC from certain liabilities. The indemnification clause helps protect VRC by requiring the Client to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless VRC from any potential claims or losses related to the tutoring services. However, it is important to note that the indemnification clause primarily addresses third-party claims and may not provide full protection in all scenarios. Including a separate limitation of liability clause that sets a maximum limit on VRC's liability, as allowed by law, could further strengthen VRC's protection. This would ensure that VRC's liability is clearly defined and limited to an agreed-upon extent. As always, it is advisable to consult with legal counsel to review and customize the indemnification clause and consider whether a separate limitation of liability clause is necessary for your specific circumstances and jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"Do I have a limitation of liability clause?","output":"Apologies for the confusion, but the provided tutoring contract does not include a specific limitation of liability clause. A limitation of liability clause typically sets a maximum limit on the amount of damages or liability that one party can be held accountable for in the event of a breach or legal claim. In the absence of a limitation of liability clause, the liability of VRC would generally be subject to the applicable laws and regulations governing contracts and legal actions in the jurisdiction mentioned in the contract (specifically, the State of New Jersey, United States). It is always prudent to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the contract adequately addresses limitations of liability and complies with relevant laws and regulations, especially if you wish to include specific limitations of liability."},{"instruction":"Could you write a short clause that cover that?","output":"Certainly! Here is a short example of a limitation of liability clause that you could consider incorporating into your tutoring contract: \\"Limitation of Liability: To the extent permitted by applicable law, the maximum liability of VRC, its contractors, or private employees arising out of or in connection with this Contract shall be limited to the total amount paid by the Client to VRC for the tutoring services under this Contract. VRC shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, or data, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\\" Please keep in mind that contract language should be tailored to your specific situation and jurisdiction. It is recommended to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the limitation of liability clause aligns with your specific circumstances and complies with applicable laws."},{"instruction":"Could you write a severability clause for my contract?","output":"Certainly! Here's an example of a severability clause that you can consider adding to your contract: \\"Severability: If any provision of this Contract is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the Contract, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the other provisions of this Contract.\\" Remember to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the language of the severability clause is suitable for your specific circumstances and complies with the laws of your jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"what does it mean by this 'by a court of competent jurisdiction'?","output":"The phrase \\"by a court of competent jurisdiction\\" refers to a legal authority that has the power and jurisdiction to make a decision regarding the validity, legality, or enforceability of a provision in a contract. It signifies that if a dispute arises and a court is called upon to determine the status of a specific provision in the contract, the court must have the appropriate jurisdiction to make a binding decision. A \\"court of competent jurisdiction\\" typically refers to a court that has the legal authority to handle the specific type of case or matter at hand. The specific court with competent jurisdiction can vary depending on factors such as the subject matter of the dispute, the location of the parties, and the laws applicable to the contract. Including the phrase \\"by a court of competent jurisdiction\\" in the severability clause emphasizes that any determination regarding the validity, illegality, or enforceability of a provision should come from a court that has the appropriate authority to make such decisions."},{"instruction":"","output":"What is your request?"},{"instruction":"I have put the price document on hold because I discovered an error, as far as I know we had agreed on 1.75 euros per ticket instead of 2.00 euros. The question now lies with AACB. Sorry for the inconvenience","output":"and confusion this may have caused. I will reach out to AACB immediately to clarify the discrepancy and rectify the error. Once I have received confirmation from AACB regarding the agreed-upon price of 1.75 euros per ticket, I will promptly proceed with updating the price document accordingly. Again, please accept my apologies for any inconvenience caused, and I will ensure that this issue is resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you for your understanding."},{"instruction":"","output":"Thank you for bringing this error to my attention. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience it may have caused. I will put the price document on hold and investigate the matter further. I will contact AACB to clarify the agreed-upon price per ticket and make the necessary adjustments to the document once we have resolved the discrepancy. I understand the importance of accuracy and ensuring that all parties are in agreement. Rest assured, I will communicate with you as soon as I have an update from AACB regarding the pricing.

Через месяц езды двигатель закипел и пришлось вызывать эвакуатор. В мастерской говорят- нужна капитала. У нее пробег больше полумиллиона. И в документах, и на приборке этого нет. Прочитал еще раз договор. Гарантийного обслуживания у них нет. Товар возврату и обмену не подлежит. Блеск. Теперь потрачу еще тысяч 300 на ремонт. Мог купить новый. Очень разочарован.","output":"1) Я никогда не был так разочарован в покупке, как с моим автомобилем из салона Автостар. Я заплатил какую-то астрономическую сумму, а получил гнилую машину. Сразу после покупки я начал замечать странный запах из салона. Я не мог понять, откуда он исходит, пока не открыл ковры - они просто воняли плесенью! Кто продает такие \\"красивые\\" машины? 2) Полный провал с моей покупкой в Автостаре. Внешне всё выглядело отлично - сияющий лакокрасочный покрытие, блестящие колеса, но как только я начал включать свет, все стало понятно. Оказывается, прожигающие лампочки в передних фарах были совершенно нерабочие! Я был вынужден тратить еще деньги на их замену и ремонт. Это просто невероятно раздражает! 3) Покупать автомобиль в Автостаре - большая ошибка, которой я совершил. Я был так рад, что нашел здесь достойную машину по хорошей цене, что даже не обратил внимание на все \\"подводные камни\\". Но когда я внимательно осмотрел свою новую покупку, я обнаружил, что на руле оставлены следы от краски, бампер с обшарпанными углами, а тормоза издают страшные скрипы при каждом использовании. Пришлось тратиться на дорогостоящий ремонт и покраску. 4) Это была самая безумная и безрассудная покупка, которую я совершил - мой автомобиль из Автостар. На первый взгляд, машина выглядела прекрасно, но уже на следующий день после покупки я заметил, что рулевое колесо трясется и автомобиль неуправляемый на скорости. Пришлось сразу отвозить его в автосервис, где мне сообщили о серьезных проблемах с подвеской и системой рулевого управления. Теперь я потратил кучу денег на ремонт, а уверенность в автомобиле потерял навсегда. 5) Мой автомобиль из Автостара - полная катастрофа! Как только я сел в него и попробовал завести двигатель, я услышал страшный скрежет и стук. Я просто не понимаю, как они могли продать мне такой глючный автомобиль! Но самым большим разочарованием для меня стала коробка передач. Она переключает передачи с такой трудностью, словно это какая-то старая ржавая железка. Я чувствую, что каждый раз, когда я машу, это может быть мой последний день на дороге. Просто ужасно!"},{"instruction":"I have temporarily parked the price document because I discovered an error, as far as I know we had agreed on 1.75 euros per ticket instead of 2.00 euros.

I am writing to address a serious matter regarding some outstanding invoices from the year 2022 which have not been sent to our company. This oversight has caused several problems that require immediate attention and resolution. First and foremost, the non-receipt of these invoices has hindered our ability to accurately maintain our financial records. It is essential for our organization to have a complete and up-to-date record of all transactions in order to assess our financial health, make informed decisions, and comply with regulatory requirements. Unfortunately, the absence of these invoices has resulted in an incomplete and inaccurate representation of our financial standing. Additionally, the failure to send these invoices has disrupted our cash flow management. Timely receipt of invoices allows us to review, verify, and schedule payments accordingly. Any delay or absence in receiving invoices prevents us from meeting our payment obligations promptly, and could potentially damage our relationship with suppliers and service providers. This not only affects our reputation but also risks hindering future collaborations and opportunities for growth. The lack of communication regarding these outstanding invoices has also left us in a vulnerable position with regard to tax compliance. In order to fulfill our legal obligations, it is imperative that we have a comprehensive record of all transactions, including those from previous years. Failure to address this issue promptly could potentially lead to penalties, audits, and additional administrative burdens. Considering the significance of these problems arising from the missing invoices, I kindly request your immediate attention and resolution of this matter. It would greatly help if you could provide us with the outstanding invoices from 2022 at the earliest, and ensure that our financial records are updated accordingly. In addition, a detailed explanation as to why these invoices were not sent will enable us to understand the root cause and prevent similar issues in the future. I would also appreciate if you could prioritize this matter and confirm your actions and timeline for resolution. Prompt action on your part will demonstrate your commitment to maintaining a strong business relationship with us and mitigate any further complications arising from this situation. I trust that you will give this matter your utmost attention, and I look forward to receiving a prompt and satisfactory resolution. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Contact Information]. Thank you for your immediate attention to this complaint. Yours sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Designation/Position] [Your Company Name]"},{"instruction":"Нейтрализует ли хлор уксусную кислоту?","output":"Да, хлор (Cl2) может нейтрализовать уксусную кислоту (CH3COOH).

Многочисленные вооруженные конфликты и гражданские войны, как внутри стран, так и на границах, привели к массовому переселению населения и ужасным условиям жизни. Этот миграционный поток оказывает огромное давление на соседние страны, которые борются с собственными экономическими и социальными проблемами. Политическая нестабильность в Средней Африке вызывает также значительные нарушения прав человека, включая эпизоды насилия, анархию и беззаконие. Нередки случаи насильственных убийств, изнасилований, пыток и проступков военных и групп, контролирующих территорию. Мигранты из Средней Африки сталкиваются с рядом проблем при попытке искать лучшую жизнь в других странах. Они подвергаются эксплуатации, незаконному задержанию, повышенным рискам для своей жизни и здоровья, а также отказу или ограничению доступа к основным услугам и защите. Миграционный кризис в Средней Африке имеет глобальное значение. Это не только угрожает безопасности и благополучию миллионов людей, но также создает огромные проблемы для стран-приемников, которые уже испытывают трудности в обеспечении своих собственных граждан. Решение политической нестабильности и миграционного кризиса в Средней Африке требует международного сотрудничества и усилий всех заинтересованных сторон. Необходима помощь в обеспечении устойчивого развития, улучшении государственного управления, содействии демократическим процессам и обеспечении справедливости и безопасности для всех жителей региона."},{"instruction":"Определение присутствия водорастворимых кислотных щелочей","output":"Водорастворимые кислотные щелочи - это соединения, которые при растворении в воде образуют ионные растворы с высоким содержанием гидроксидных ионов (ОН-) или других кислотных групп.

Create the necessary physical volumes (PV) for the new VG. This could be a partition or a whole disk. For example, let's assume the new PV is \`/dev/sdb1\`: \`\`\` sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1 \`\`\` 2. Extend the existing volume group (optional step if you want to combine the new VG with the existing VG). For instance, if the existing VG is named \\"vg_name\\" and you want to extend it with the new PV, run: \`\`\` sudo vgextend vg_name /dev/sdb1 \`\`\` 3. Create a logical volume (LV) within the new VG. Replace \`lv_name\` with your desired logical volume name, \`vg_name\` with the existing VG or the new VG if it's a separate one, and \`size\` with the desired size of the LV: \`\`\` sudo lvcreate -L size -n lv_name vg_name \`\`\` 4. Format the logical volume with the desired filesystem. For example, to use ext4: \`\`\` sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name \`\`\` 5. Mount the logical volume to a directory. Create a new directory for the mount point if it doesn't exist: \`\`\` sudo mkdir /mnt/your_mount_point sudo mount /dev/vg_name/lv_name /mnt/your_mount_point \`\`\` 6. After performing the above steps, edit the \`/etc/fstab\` file with a text editor (e.g., \`sudo nano /etc/fstab\`) and add a new entry for the newly created logical volume. For example: \`\`\` /dev/mapper/vg_name-lv_name /mnt/your_mount_point ext4 defaults 0 0 \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`vg_name\`, \`lv_name\`, and \`/mnt/your_mount_point\` with the actual names and mount point you used in the previous steps. Now, when you restart your Debian system, the second volume group should be automatically loaded and mounted at the specified mount point."},{"instruction":"hey chat gpt i am studying government inspector by nikoli googol i want you to help me by asikng you questions about the story and answering it ok?","output":"Of course!

Wraz z rozwojem technologii komunikacyjnych i zwiększającą się ilością informacji przesyłanych przez sieci, zagrożenia dla bezpieczeństwa stają się coraz bardziej wymagające i złożone. Bezpieczeństwo sieci odnosi się do ochrony informacji i systemów komputerowych przed nieautoryzowanym dostępem, zmianami lub uszkodzeniem. Celem bezpieczeństwa sieci jest zapewnienie poufności, integralności i dostępności danych przechowywanych i przesyłanych przez sieć. Istnieje wiele potencjalnych zagrożeń dla bezpieczeństwa sieci, które mogą prowadzić do utraty danych, wycieku poufnych informacji, ataków na systemy lub uszkodzenia infrastruktury sieciowej. Należy do nich m.in. hakerstwo, wirusy komputerowe, spam, phishing oraz ataki DDoS (rozproszonych ataków odmową usługi). Aby zapewnić bezpieczeństwo sieci, konieczne jest zastosowanie odpowiednich środków ochronnych. Poniżej przedstawiam kilka kluczowych strategii i metod zabezpieczania sieci: 1. Firewall - system filtrujący ruch sieciowy, który kontroluje połączenia przychodzące i wychodzące oraz blokuje nieautoryzowany dostęp do sieci. 2. Antywirus - program komputerowy, który wykrywa, blokuje i usuwa złośliwe oprogramowanie, takie jak wirusy, trojany i robaki. 3. Szyfrowanie danych - stosowanie algorytmów kryptograficznych do zabezpieczenia danych przed odczytem lub zmianą przez nieautoryzowanych użytkowników. 4. Autoryzacja i uwierzytelnianie - proces weryfikacji tożsamości użytkowników i przydzielanie uprawnień dostępu do zasobów sieciowych na podstawie loginu, hasła, certyfikatów lub innych metod identyfikacji. 5. Regularne aktualizacje oprogramowania - aby zapobiec lukom w zabezpieczeniach, ważne jest regularne instalowanie aktualizacji oprogramowania i łatki, które poprawiają zidentyfikowane błędy bezpieczeństwa. 6. Audyt bezpieczeństwa - regularne przeprowadzanie audytów bezpieczeństwa sieci w celu identyfikacji potencjalnych luk w zabezpieczeniach oraz weryfikacji, czy zastosowane środki bezpieczeństwa są skuteczne. 7. Szkolenie personelu - edukacja użytkowników sieci w zakresie zasad bezpieczeństwa, takich jak unikanie otwierania podejrzanych załączników e-mailowych, korzystanie z silnych haseł i nieudostępnianie poufnych informacji osobom nieuprawnionym. Wraz z rozwojem technologii, pojawiają się również nowe zagrożenia, takie jak ransomware, ataki z wykorzystaniem sztucznej inteligencji, czy infrastruktury IoT. Dlatego też konieczne jest ciągłe monitorowanie i aktualizacja środków bezpieczeństwa sieci w celu zapewnienia ochrony przed najnowszymi zagrożeniami. Podsumowując, bezpieczeństwo sieci jest niezwykle ważnym aspektem zarządzania informacjami w dzisiejszym zglobalizowanym świecie. Właściwe zastosowanie odpowiednich środków ochronnych i regularne monitorowanie bezpieczeństwa sieci mogą przeciwdziałać zagrożeniom i minimalizować ryzyko utraty danych i ataków na systemy."},{"instruction":"Как называются корни в 4, 5, 6, 7?

Scientists have been studying it for decades, yet its exact nature and properties continue to elude them. This article explores some of the most intriguing aspects of dark matter and the ongoing quest to unravel its mysteries. 引言： 暗物质是一种无法直接观测到但占据宇宙总质量相当大比例的物质，它仍然是现代物理学中最大的谜之一。科学家们已经研究它数十年，然而其确切的本质和特性仍然使他们困扰不已。本文探讨了暗物质最引人注目的一些方面以及揭示其奥秘的持续追求。 The Quest for Dark Matter: Scientists first proposed the existence of dark matter in the 1930s to explain the observed gravitational effects in galaxies that could not be accounted for by visible matter alone. Since then, extensive research has been conducted to understand the nature of this elusive substance. Various experiments have been designed to detect dark matter particles, such as the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS). However, despite the efforts, direct detection of dark matter has remained elusive. 暗物质的追求： 科学家们首次在1930年代提出了暗物质的存在，以解释仅通过可见物质无法解释的星系中观测到的重力效应。自那时以来，人们一直进行深入研究，试图了解这种难以捉摸的物质的本质。已经设计了各种实验来检测暗物质粒子，例如大型地下泽冈实验（LUX实验）和低温暗物质搜索（CDMS）。然而，尽管做出了努力，直接探测暗物质仍然是困难的。 The Nature of Dark Matter: Currently, there are several prevailing theories on the nature of dark matter. One theory suggests that dark matter consists of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which interact very weakly with ordinary matter and are therefore difficult to detect. Another theory proposes that dark matter is composed of axions, hypothetical particles that have a negligible mass and could potentially explain phenomena such as the observed rotation curves of galaxies. Additionally, some scientists believe that dark matter could be made up of primordial black holes or other exotic particles yet to be discovered. 暗物质的本质： 目前，关于暗物质本质的几种主要理论。一个理论认为，暗物质由与普通物质相互作用十分微弱的弱相互作用大质量粒子（WIMP）组成，因此很难探测。另一个理论则是认为暗物质由设想中的质量可以忽略不计的轴子组成，轴子可能可以解释观测到的星系旋转曲线等现象。此外，一些科学家认为暗物质可能由原始黑洞或其他尚未发现的异质粒子组成。 Implications of Dark Matter: Dark matter's existence has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe. It is believed to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, as its gravitational pull affects the distribution and dynamics of visible matter. Moreover, dark matter is thought to have shaped the large-scale structure of the universe, including the formation of galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments. Understanding the true nature of dark matter is therefore essential to comprehending the fundamental workings of the cosmos. 暗物质的意义： 暗物质的存在对我们理解宇宙有着深远的影响。人们认为，暗物质在星系的形成和演化中起着至关重要的作用，因为它的引力影响了可见物质的分布和动力学。此外，人们认为暗物质塑造了宇宙的大尺度结构，包括星系团和宇宙丝的形成。因此，理解暗物质的真正本质对于理解宇宙的基本运行方式至关重要。 Conclusion: The quest to unravel the mysteries of dark matter continues to captivate the scientific community. While progress has been made in understanding its implications and potential nature, definitive answers remain elusive. Through ongoing research and technological advancements, scientists hope to shed light on this elusive substance and gain a deeper understanding of the universe's hidden dimensions. 结论： 揭示暗物质的奥秘的探索继续吸引着科学界的关注。尽管在理解其影响和潜在本质方面取得了进展，但确切答案仍然难以把握。通过持续的研究和技术进步，科学家们希望能够揭示这种难以捉摸的物质的本质，并对宇宙的隐藏维度有更深入的了解。"},{"instruction":"more","output":"Certainly! Here's another high-level IELTS reading passage with English-Chinese translation: Title: The Paradox of Time Travel Title: 时间旅行的悖论 Introduction: Time travel has long been a subject of fascination and speculation, both in the realm of science fiction and in scientific discussions. The concept of journeying through time, whether forward or backward, raises numerous paradoxes and philosophical conundrums. This article explores the paradoxes associated with time travel and the various theories proposed to reconcile them. 引言： 时间旅行长期以来一直是科幻领域和科学讨论中引发着人们的兴趣和猜测。通过时间旅行，无论是向前还是向后，引发了许多悖论和哲学难题。本文探讨了与时间旅行相关的悖论以及各种理论提出的解决方案。 The Grandfather Paradox: One of the most famous paradoxes associated with time travel is the grandfather paradox. It postulates that if a person were to travel back in time and kill their own grandfather before they had children, then the traveler would never be born, making their time travel impossible. This raises questions about the consistency of the timeline and the possibility of changing the past. 祖父悖论： 与时间旅行相关的最著名的悖论之一是祖父悖论。它提出，如果一个人回到过去，在他们的祖父生孩子之前杀死了他们的祖父，那么这个时间旅行者永远不会出生，使得他们的时间旅行变得不可能。这引发了关于时间线的连续性以及改变过去的可能性的问题。 The Novikov Self-consistency Principle: In an attempt to address the paradoxes of time travel, Russian physicist Igor Novikov proposed the self-consistency principle. According to this principle, any actions performed after traveling back in time must be consistent with the events that have already occurred and cannot alter the past. In other words, if a person were to go back in time and try to change an event, their actions would inadvertently contribute to the fulfillment of that very event. 诺维科夫自恰原理： 为了解决时间旅行的悖论，俄罗斯物理学家伊戈尔·诺维科夫提出了自恰原理。根据这个原理，回到过去后进行的任何行为必须与已经发生的事件一致，不能改变过去。换句话说，如果一个人回到过去试图改变一个事件，他们的行为会无意地造成该事件的实现。 The Bootstrap Paradox: Another paradox associated with time travel is the bootstrap paradox. It involves a causal loop, where an object is sent back in time, becomes its own cause, and therefore has no original origin. For example, if a composer were to receive a piece of music from their future self and then claim it as their own composition, the question arises: Who composed the piece of music in the first place? 启示悖论： 与时间旅行相关的另一个悖论是启示悖论。它涉及到一个因果环路，其中一个物体被送回到过去，成为自己的原因，因此没有真正的起源。例如，如果一个作曲家从他们的未来自己那里得到一首音乐作品，然后声称那是他们自己的作品，问题就出现了：那首音乐作品最早是谁创作的呢？ Conclusion: Time travel, while a fascinating concept, presents us with numerous paradoxes and philosophical challenges. The nature of time and its relationship with causality and free will continue to baffle both scientists and philosophers. Although various theories have been proposed, the enigma of time travel remains unresolved, leaving us to ponder the mysteries of the universe and the limits of our understanding. 结论： 时间旅行是一个令人着迷的概念，但它给我们带来了许多悖论和哲学上的挑战。时间的本质以及其与因果关系和自由意志的关系仍然困扰着科学家和哲学家。尽管提出了各种理论，时间旅行之谜仍然没有解决，让我们思考宇宙的奥秘和我们理解的局限性。"},{"instruction":"more","output":"Certainly! Here's another challenging IELTS reading passage with English-Chinese translation: Title: The Fermi Paradox: Where is Everybody? Title: 费米悖论：大家在哪里？ Introduction: The Fermi Paradox refers to the apparent contradiction between the high probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for their presence. Physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked, \\"Where is everybody?\\" Despite the vast number of potentially habitable planets in the universe, we have yet to find any conclusive proof of intelligent life beyond Earth. This article explores the various hypotheses proposed to explain the Fermi Paradox. 引言： 费米悖论指的是外星文明存在的高概率和缺乏证据来支持他们存在的明显矛盾。物理学家恩里科·费米曾问：“大家在哪里？”尽管宇宙中潜在的适宜居住的行星数量庞大，我们尚未找到任何确凿的超越地球智慧生命的证据。本文探讨了解释费米悖论的各种假设。 The Drake Equation: The Drake Equation, proposed by physicist Frank Drake, estimates the number of advanced civilizations in our galaxy that could communicate with us. It takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the probability of life developing on suitable planets. However, despite optimistic estimations, we have yet to detect any communicative signals from extraterrestrial beings. 德雷克方程： 德雷克方程是物理学家弗兰克·德雷克提出的，可以估算我们银河系中能够与我们交流的高级文明的数量。它考虑了诸如恒星形成速率、具有行星系统的恒星比例以及适合行星上生命形成的概率等因素。然而，尽管乐观的估计，我们尚未发现外星生命的任何通信信号。 The Great Filter: One hypothesis to explain the Fermi Paradox is the Great Filter theory. It suggests that at some point in the evolution of civilizations, there is a \\"filter\\" that prevents them from advancing to the stage of interstellar communication. This filter could be a cataclysmic event that destroys civilizations or a bottleneck in the development of technology and intelligence. If the Great Filter lies in our past, it would explain why we have yet to encounter extraterrestrial civilizations. 伟大滤波器： 解释费米悖论的一个假设是“伟大滤波器”理论。它认为，在文明的进化过程中的某个阶段，存在一个“滤波器”，阻止它们进一步发展到星际通讯的阶段。这个滤波器可能是毁灭性的事件，摧毁文明，或者是技术和智慧发展的瓶颈。如果伟大滤波器存在于我们的过去，那就能解释为什么我们还没有遇到外星文明。 The Zoo Hypothesis: Another explanation is the Zoo Hypothesis, which suggests that advanced alien civilizations are intentionally hiding or isolating themselves from humanity. They may be observing us, allowing us to develop naturally without interference, or they may be waiting for us to reach a certain level of technological advancement before making contact. This hypothesis assumes that extraterrestrial civilizations have the capability to monitor and remain undetected by us. 动物园假说： 另一个解释是动物园假说，它认为先进的外星文明有意地隐藏或与人类隔离。他们可能正在观察我们，让我们自然地发展而不受干扰，或者他们可能正在等待我们达到一定的技术水平后再进行接触。这个假设假设外星文明具备监视和不被我们察觉的能力。 Conclusion: The Fermi Paradox raises profound questions about the existence and nature of intelligent life in the universe. While numerous theories have been proposed, we have yet to find a definitive answer. The ongoing search for extraterrestrial life and our quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe continue to captivate the scientific community and fuel our curiosity about our place in the cosmos. 结论： 费米悖论对宇宙中智慧生命的存在和性质提出了深刻的问题。尽管提出了许多理论，但我们尚未找到确凿的答案。关于外星生命的持续搜索和揭示宇宙奥秘的追求继续吸引着科学界的关注，并激发我们对自身在宇宙中位置的好奇心。"},{"instruction":"more","output":"Certainly! Here's another challenging IELTS reading passage with English-Chinese translation: Title: The Multiverse Theory: Exploring Parallel Universes Title: 多元宇宙理论：探索平行宇宙 Introduction: The concept of the multiverse, where our universe is just one of many parallel universes, has gained traction in the field of theoretical physics. According to this theory, there could be an infinite number of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and conditions. This article explores the multiverse theory and its implications for our understanding of the cosmos. 引言： 多元宇宙的概念，在这个理论中，我们的宇宙只是众多平行宇宙之一，已经在理论物理学领域逐渐得到认同。根据这个理论，可能存在无限数量的宇宙，每个宇宙都具有自己的物理法则和条件。本文探讨多元宇宙理论及其对我们对宇宙的理解的影响。 The Inflationary Multiverse: One variant of the multiverse theory is the inflationary multiverse, which suggests that our universe underwent a rapid expansion called inflation shortly after the Big Bang. During this inflationary period, other regions of space-time underwent inflation as well, giving rise to separate universes. These parallel universes would have different physical properties, making them distinct from our own. 膨胀多元宇宙： 多元宇宙理论的一个变体是膨胀多元宇宙，它认为在大爆炸"},{"instruction":"Kolay Türkçe kullanarak erotik bir hikaye yazın.

Трибоелектричният ефект се основава на разликата в електронната афинност и ионизационната енергия на материалите на повърхностите. Когато две различни материала се допират и разделят, електроните от единия материал се преместват към другия материал. Това създава разлика в електричния потенциал между двете повърхности, което води до появата на статични заряди на тях. Единият материал става положително зареден, а другият - отрицателно зареден. Примери за трибоелектричен ефект включват триене на вълна с вълна, триене на дърво с косъм или триене на полиестер с найлон. Всеки материал има различни коефициенти на триене и генерира различно количество заряди. Това означава, че е възможно да се генерират различни комбинации от положителни и отрицателни заряди в зависимост от материалите, които се използват.

Hobbes, in his book \\"Leviathan,\\" presented a pessimistic view of human nature. He believed that humans were inherently selfish, aggressive, and driven by their own self-interests. Hobbes argued that in a state of nature, where there is no government or social order, life would be \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" To escape this perilous state, Hobbes believed that a strong central authority was necessary to maintain peace and order. He advocated for an absolute monarchy or a sovereign ruler with unlimited power to enforce laws and protect people from each other. On the other hand, John Locke held a more positive view of human nature. He believed that human beings were born with natural rights, including life, liberty, and property. According to Locke, individuals had the right to protect themselves and their property, and they possessed the freedom to pursue their own interests and happiness. Unlike Hobbes, Locke argued that the primary function of government was to protect these rights, rather than ruling with absolute authority. He advocated for a limited government with checks and balances, where power was derived from the consent of the governed. Locke's ideas were influential in the development of liberal democracy. In summary, Hobbes and Locke had contrasting ideologies regarding human nature and the role of government. Hobbes believed that authority and a strong ruler were essential to maintain social order due to his pessimistic view of humanity, while Locke emphasized the natural rights and liberties of individuals and considered government as a means to protect those rights."},{"instruction":"can you write it like a 5th grader would?","output":"Sure! Here's a simplified explanation of the ideologies of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke that a 5th grader might understand: Thomas Hobbes believed that people are naturally selfish and not very nice to each other.

John Locke, on the other hand, thought that people are generally good and have certain rights, like the right to live, be free, and own property. He believed that the main job of the government is to protect these rights. Locke thought that people should have a say in how they are governed, and that the government should not have too much power. In a nutshell, Hobbes believed in a strong ruler to keep people in check, while Locke believed in protecting people's rights and having a say in the government."},{"instruction":"no write it like one not like a 5th grader would understand","output":"Apologies for the confusion.

He thought that without a strong government to control them, people would constantly fight and life would be chaotic. So he argued for a powerful ruler, like a king, who could maintain order and protect people from each other. Locke, on the other hand, had a more positive view of human nature. He believed that people are born with certain natural rights, such as the rights to life, liberty, and property. He thought that government's primary role should be to protect these rights. Locke also emphasized the idea of consent, meaning that people should have a say in how they are governed.

Here's a simplified explanation of the ideologies of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke: Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were two important philosophers who lived a long time ago. They had different thoughts about how governments should work and what people are like. Hobbes believed that people are generally selfish and only care about themselves. He thought that if there was no strong government, people would constantly fight and life would be chaotic. So, according to him, we need a strong leader, like a king, to keep things under control and protect us from each other. On the other hand, Locke had a more positive view of people. He believed that we all have certain basic rights, like the right to live our lives, be free, and own things. Locke said that governments should be there to protect these rights. He also thought that it's important for people to have a say in how the government is run. Locke suggested that the government should have limits and different people should have power to balance things out.

The animators utilized various techniques to bring the manga to life, including: 1. Key Frame Animation: This technique involves creating the main drawings or keyframes that define the major movements, actions, and key poses of the characters. These keyframes serve as the foundation for the animated sequences. 2. In-Between Animation: After the keyframes are established, the animators fill in the gaps by creating intermediate drawings, known as in-between frames. These frames help smooth out the animation and create seamless movements. 3. Digital Animation: The Bleach TYBW anime likely utilized digital animation techniques. Unlike traditional hand-drawn animation, digital animation involves using software and digital tools to create the characters, backgrounds, and other visual elements. This allows for greater control, efficiency, and enhanced visual effects. 4. Action Choreography: The animators meticulously planned and choreographed the action sequences to ensure exciting and fluid movements. This included developing dynamic fight choreography, capturing the characters' unique abilities, and employing proper timing for impactful moments. 5. Special Effects Animation: As Bleach is known for its supernatural powers and flashy attacks, the TYBW adaptation employed special effects animation. This involved animating the characters' spiritual powers, energy blasts, explosions, and other magical or elemental effects. 6. Camera Movements: To enhance the overall visual experience, the animators used various camera movements and angles. They employed techniques such as panning, zooming, tracking, and dynamic camera angles to add depth, intensity, and visual interest to the scenes. 7. Motion Blur and Speed Lines: In fast-paced action scenes, the animators utilized motion blur effect and speed lines to convey a sense of speed and dynamic motion. These techniques help create a sense of motion and emphasize the characters' rapid movements. 8. Lighting and Shading: To enhance the overall aesthetic and atmosphere, the animators paid close attention to lighting and shading. They implemented techniques such as shadows, highlights, and color gradients to give the characters and environments a more three-dimensional and realistic appearance. 9. Background Art: The background artists created detailed and visually rich environments. This involved creating intricate landscapes, buildings, battlefields, and other settings to immerse the viewers in the world of Bleach. 10. Post-Production: After the animation process, post-production techniques such as editing, color correction, and adding sound effects and music were employed to polish the final product and enhance the overall impact of the scenes.

Статични заряди може да се генерират при допир на две повърхности с различен електричен потенциал, като например при триене или разделение. Когато се допират, електроните могат да се преместят от едната повърхност към другата, което води до разделението на положителни и отрицателни заряди. Тези заряди могат да се запазят върху повърхностите и да създават статичен електричен потенциал между тях. Какво точно ще се случи при допирането и разделението на зарядите зависи от свойствата на материалите, които се използват и от условията на самия процес."},{"instruction":"Вярно ли е че : При допира електроните се прехвърлят от повърхността с по-висок потенциал към тази с по-нисък.","output":"Не, това не е винаги верно.

Кое точно ще се случи зависи от свойствата на материалите и от условията на процеса. Например, в някои случаи може да има предаване на електрони от повърхността с по-нисък потенциал към повърхността с по-висок, като резултат на триене или контакт.

При електростатичен разряд възниква спонтанен пренос на електрически заряди между обекти с различен електричен потенциал. Този пренос на заряди се съпровожда от движение на електроните и за тях е характерно изразено топлинно движение. При движението си, електроните се сблъскват с атомите и молекулите на околните материали, което генерира топлина. Затова, при електростатичен разряд се отделя топлина. Това е видно в искрите, които могат да се видят при множество електростатични явления като триене, пробиване на изолатори и други."},{"instruction":"Вярно ли е че: Потенциалите на две заземени тела са различни.","output":"Не, това не е верно. Когато две тела са заземени, те се свързват с Земята чрез проводник или друга добре проводима връзка. Това означава, че потенциалът на двете заземени тела ще бъде равен на потенциала на Земята. Заземяването има за цел да нулира електричния потенциал на телата. Така, ако сравним потенциалите на две заземени тела, те трябва да бъдат еднакви или много близки. В противен случай, ако разликата в потенциалите беше значителна, щеше да има поток от заряди от едното към другото, което би предизвикало изравняване на потенциалите."},{"instruction":"вярно ли е че: Зарядите в човешкото тяло често се разреждат, но за да се усетим удар, разрядът трябва да бъде около 3,000 волта.","output":"Това изказване е неточно. Зарядите в човешкото тяло може да се разреждат, например чрез триене или други електростатични явления, но не е необходимо да има разряд от около 3,000 волта, за да усетим удар. Факторите, които влияят на чувствителността на електричния удар, включват индивидуалната чувствителност и състоянието на човешкото тяло, интензитетът на тока, времетраенето на контакта и други обстоятелства. Человек може да усети електричен удар дори и при много по-ниски напрежения, особено ако те преминават през чувствителни области на тялото или ако има други фактори, като влажност или контакт с метални предмети. Усещането на електричен удар е много индивидуално и може да се различава от човек на човек."},{"instruction":"за да усети удар човек колко волта трябва да бъде разрядът ?","output":"Не мога да укажа конкретното напрежение във волтове, което е необходимо за човек да усети удар, тъй като това се определя от много фактори. Факторите включват индивидуалната чувствителност на човека, влажността на кожата, интензитетът на тока, времетраенето на контакта и други обстоятелства. Различни хора могат да имат различна чувствителност на електричния ток. Въпреки това, обикновено за по-високи напрежения е необходимо по-малко време на контакт или по-тесен контакт със съпротивлени материали като метал, за да бъде усетен ударът. Примерно, при напрежение от около 50-60 волта AC (променлив ток), човек може да усети удар при докосване на метални предмети с по-голяма проводимост. Въпреки това, електрическите удари представляват сериозна опасност за здравето и трябва да се избягва доколкото е възможно.

The choice of model for object detection largely depends on your specific requirements, such as accuracy, speed, and computational resource constraints. However, some widely recognized models that you might consider include: 1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once) Series**: YOLO models are known for their speed and real-time performance. The latest in the series, YOLOv5, features improvements in speed and accuracy. There is also YOLOv4 and YOLOv3, which are both powerful and widely used. 2. **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**: SSD is another popular model that balances speed and accuracy. It's a good choice if you need a middle ground between the fastest and the most accurate models. 3. **Faster R-CNN**: Faster R-CNN is recognized for its high accuracy. It uses a region proposal network (RPN) to identify object proposals, followed by a classifier to detect objects. However, it's generally slower than YOLO and SSD. 4. **RetinaNet**: RetinaNet uses a feature pyramid network (FPN) and a novel loss function called Focal Loss to handle the issue of class imbalance during training. It's known for its high accuracy, especially in detecting small objects. 5. **EfficientDet**: EfficientDet is designed for efficiency, providing a scalable architecture that can be adjusted for different resource constraints. It achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed. 6. **Mask R-CNN**: An extension of Faster R-CNN, this model provides pixel-wise segmentation, making it especially useful if you need to do instance segmentation along with object detection. 7. **CenterNet**: CenterNet is an anchor-free model that detects objects by their center points, avoiding the need for the complex anchor box generation phase. It's faster than R-CNN based models while maintaining competitive accuracy. 8. **Scaled-YOLOv4**: An extension of YOLO, designed for scaling across different-sized models to accommodate various equipment and scenarios, achieving a good balance between speed and accuracy. When choosing a model, consider these factors: - **Dataset**: The type and size of your dataset may align better with certain models. - **Accuracy**: High accuracy might be crucial for some applications, while for others, it may not be as critical. - **Speed**: Real-time applications require fast prediction times, whereas offline processing can afford slower, more accurate models. - **Compute Resources**: If you have limited computational resources, you may want a model designed for efficiency. - **Use Case**: Specialty use cases might benefit from models tailored to specific scenarios or types of data. Remember to fine-tune any pre-trained model on your specific dataset to achieve the best performance for your unique application. With model zoos and frameworks like TensorFlow Object Detection API and PyTorch's torchvision, it's becoming easier to experiment with various models to find the best fit for your needs."},{"instruction":"Explicame como era la historia Antigua de India","output":"La historia antigua de India se remonta a miles de años atrás. La civilización del valle del Indo, una de las civilizaciones más antiguas conocidas, floreció en el noroeste del subcontinente indio entre el 2500 a.C. y el 1500 a.C. Esta civilización desarrolló sistemas urbanos avanzados, una escritura única y una economía basada en la agricultura. Después de la caída de la civilización del valle del Indo, se desarrollaron varios reinos y dinastías en diferentes partes de la India. Uno de los primeros reinos importantes fue el de los arios, un grupo de pueblos nómadas que migraron a la India alrededor del 1500 a.C. y establecieron su dominio en el norte del país. Durante el período védico (1500 a.C. - 600 a.C.), se compusieron los Vedas, escrituras sagradas hindúes que se convirtieron en la base del hinduismo. La sociedad india se dividió en castas, con los brahmanes (sacerdotes) en la cima de la jerarquía. Entre el 600 a.C. y el 320 a.C., surgieron varias ciudades-estado y reinos en el norte de la India. El período de Maurya (322 a.C. - 185 a.C.) fue uno de los más importantes, con el emperador Ashoka como uno de los gobernantes más célebres de esta dinastía. Ashoka promovió el budismo y se le atribuye la diseminación de esta religión tanto en India como en otras partes de Asia. A partir del siglo I a.C., se inició la era de los reinos en el sur de la India, especialmente en los actuales estados de Tamil Nadu y Kerala. Estos reinos, como el Imperio Chola y el Imperio Pandya, fueron conocidos por su comercio marítimo y su rica cultura. Durante la Edad Media, varios imperios tomaron el control de la India, como el Imperio Gupta (siglos IV-VI) y el Imperio Mughal (1526-1857). El imperio Mughal, en particular, fue conocido por su arquitectura, arte y tolerancia religiosa, aunque el país también experimentó conflictos y tensiones religiosas durante este período. Hacia fines del siglo XVIII, el Raj británico comenzó a establecer su dominio sobre la India, hasta que finalmente logró su independencia en 1947. La lucha por la independencia fue liderada por Mahatma Gandhi, quien abogó por la no violencia y la resistencia pacífica contra el dominio británico. En resumen, la historia antigua de India es rica y diversa, con una variedad de civilizaciones, reinos y imperios que dejaron su huella en el subcontinente indio. Desde la civilización del valle del Indo hasta la independencia del dominio británico, la historia de India ha sido moldeada por innumerables eventos, líderes y culturas."},{"instruction":"write: Customer has advised that he didn't uninstall the software, he initiated the new installation, with the Latest Version, and redeploy the OS, 3.8.0.3, Do I share with him the procedures for the reinstallation?

However, problems also arise when it comes to the heavy emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the fossil fuels, which breaks the carbon balance in the natural world and contributions to global warming. Currently, the concentration of CO2 in atmosphere is increasing drastically from 280 to 400 ppm since late 19th century, and it is predicted to reach 570 ppm by 2100 without any intervention. Converting CO2 to fuels and value-added chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, alcohols, formate, organic acids, etc., has drawn much attention for its merits to both effectively decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration and develop a sustainable carbon-neutral economy. Various methods for CO2 conversion have been explored and studied, including electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, biochemical and thermo-chemical CO2 reduction. Among these methods, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an ideal one owing to its: 1) moderate operation condition at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure; 2) high CO2 conversion efficiency and effective utilization of renewable energy and surplus electricity; 3) conveniently regulated CO2 reduction rate by applying different external bias voltages; 4) relatively easy separation of products by use of different reaction chambers on different electrodes. Despite the advantages of electrochemical CO2RR, there are still some issues need to be addressed, such as: 1) the sluggish kinetics owing to the multiple electron transfer steps; 2) competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to close operating voltage windows; 3) low reaction selectivity induced by the underlying complicated mechanism; 4) inferior stability of materials under high potential. Thus, efficient catalysts with high activity, high stability and high selectivity are urgently pursued. Metal-based nanomaterials are one of the most efficient catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR. Noble metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), etc. and transition metals such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), bismuth (Bi), indium (In), tin (Sn), ferrum (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), antimony (Sb), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), etc. have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2RR with abundant interests (Figure 1a). Some other metals such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), Thallium (Tl), etc. are also active for CO2RR, but they have not been paid much attention due to their high toxicity and environmental hazards. Compared to these metal elements, Bi, which is a member of group V on the periodic table, is a semi-metal with overlapping valence and conduction bands. Bi has natural advantages of low cost, low toxicity, high efficiency for CO2RR and sluggish kinetic activity for HER, which also contributes to the enhanced selectivity of the products. As a result, Bi‐based materials, including not only Bi metal, but also Bi oxide, Bi sulfide and Bi subcarbonate (Bi2O2CO3, BOC), etc., have emerged as a kind of promising catalysts to deliver a large current density and high selectivity towards electrochemical CO2RR. However, it needs to be noted that the Bi-based materials are not stable enough because metallic Bi is vulnerable to oxidation in air while the other Bi-based compounds may easily undergo a reconstruction at high voltage during the electrochemical CO2RR process. Moreover, it may be undesirable for Bi-based materials to reach a breakthrough for formate electrosynthesis due to the limited single Bi site on the catalyst surface. Therefore, a rational design of Bi-based materials to enhance the activity and stability for electrochemical CO2RR is of great significance. Recently, heterojunction catalysts have attracted much attention in the field of CO2RR. The heterojunction catalysts refer to materials with interfaces in a hybrid or composite of multiple solid-state materials, across which the chemical composition of the constituent changes. The advantages of constructing a Bi-based heterojunction structure are as follows: 1) Synergistic active sites of the components with different physical/chemical functions will be combined to enhance the reaction activity; 2) A spontaneous charge transfer may be facilitated between the different components for a built-in electronic field to improve the conversion efficiency; 3) The introduction of inert or stable components to cover or confine the delicate Bi-based catalyst will obviously improve the stability of the hetero-structured material; 4) Diverse structures with tunable morphology, composition and lattice strain can be well achieved. In the past several years, there have been excellent works of advanced Bi-based heterojunctions (Figure 1b), which highly promotes the development of electrochemical CO2RR. Although there have been reviews on the Bi-based materials or metal-based heterogenous catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR, to the best of our knowledge, there is no review focusing on the Bi-based heterojunctions. In this review, heterojunction construction for high-performance design of Bi-based electrocatalysts is fully discussed (Figure 2). It begins with the fundamentals of Bi-based catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR. Then, synthetic methods and different kinds of advanced Bi-based heterojunction structures are introduced. Afterwards, the electrochemical CO2RR performance of these Bi-based heterojunctions are discussed. Finally, an in-depth analysis of the existing challenges and the current outlook for this field is provided.","output":"Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, have been extensively utilized as the primary energy source for industry since the 19th century, contributing significantly to global economic development and prosperity.

Currently, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased dramatically from 280 to 400 parts per million (ppm) since the late 19th century, and if left unchecked, it is predicted to reach 570 ppm by 2100.

Electrochemical CO2RR mechanism over Bi-based catalysts Although different kinds of products such as monoxide, hydrocarbons, alcohols, formic acid, etc. may emerge during the electrochemical CO2RR process, the main product for Bi-based catalysts is formic acid or formate owing to their unique selectivity. But with the change of nano/microstructure or coordination environment, the product may also change. For example, CO served as the main product for electrochemical CO2RR for the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) supported Bi single atoms. The formation of formic acid/formate over Bi-based catalysts usually consists of three pathways, including the first capture of CO2 molecules on the Bi surface, then reaction of CO2 with electrons and protons to form intermediates and products, and final the desorption of products from Bi surface (Figure 3). As can be seen, the difference among the three pathways lies in the formation of different bonding ways of intermediate. With the carbon atom, two oxygen atoms or one oxygen atom combining to Bi, three different intermediates of *COOH, *OOCH and *OCHO will form. According to previous research, the first proton coupling determines the selectivity for a catalyst, and the selectivity of reaction pathway i is not high enough because the *COOH intermediate may lose H2O to form CO, or be reduced to form HCOOH. For reaction pathway ii and iii, only HCOOH will form as product, while the energy barrier of OCHO* intermediate formation is lower than that of *COOH and HCOO*. Moreover, the reaction pathways of the formic acid are relatively simpler than those of other products. All these thus may explain the high acidity and high selectivity of formic acid as the main product for Bi-based catalysts. 2.2. Effects of Bi-based heterojunctions for electrochemical CO2RR In most cases, fabrication of heterojunctions will combine the advantages of both materials, leading to a more optimized structure and facilitated functions of catalysts. Meanwhile, a series of effects may also occur due to the incorporation of two components with different nano/micro structures (Figure 4). i) Synergistic effect. Since the heterojunction will combine the advantages of both materials, the functions of the components may be also combined. As illustrated in Section 2.1, the formation and conversion of intermediate is important for electrochemical CO2RR. By forming a heterojunction, the atoms in intermediate may interact with both components, thus highly facilitating the reduction of CO2. ii) Microenvironment effect. The inherent surface properties of a heterogeneous catalyst directly determine its electrocatalytic performance. However, the microenvironment surrounding the catalyst (reactant/intermediate species concentration, surface hydrophilicity, local pH, etc.) in electrolyte also highly associated with the catalyst behaviors. Thus, the fabrication of heterojunction may influence the microenvironment on the catalyst surface, especially upon application of bias during electrochemical CO2RR process, leading to a difference of the concentration and stabilization of the reactants and other intermediate species involved in the reaction. iii) Electron transfer effect. The integrated components usually bear different work functions, which means their electron trapping abilities are different. In this case, the electrons tend to transfer from the component with a lower work function to another component with a higher work function, leading to a built-in electric field and spontaneous electron transfer, which may accelerate the electrode-electrolytes reaction and thus improve CO2 reduction. iv) Interfacial strain effect. Due to the lattice mismatch, a curved surface with compressive or tensile strains will often appear at the interface of the heterojunction, according to the crystal parameters of the components. Such a strain effect will optimize the electronic structure at the interface, resulting in facilitated adsorption/desorption behaviors of intermediates. v) Morphology effect. Bi-based compounds are easy to be exfoliated into a two-dimensional(2D) single layer or multiple layers, thereby increasing the specific surface area and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. Despite the 2D morphology, it has been reported that some specific morphologies can be commonly obtained during the synthetic process of high-performance Bi-based electrocatalysts for CO2RR, such as nanoparticle, nanowire and nanosheet for Bi metals, nanoparticle and nanosheet for Bi oxides, nanorod and nanosheet for Bi sulfide, nanoparticle and nanosheet for BOC. Thus, morphology evolutions may appear during the in situ fabrication of Bi-based heterojunctions with the assistant of surfactants, temperature, or potentials. Through rational regulation, morphology evolutions such as from nanoparticle to nanosheet, from nanowire to nanosheet, and from nanorod to nanosheet can be realized by using different Bi-based precursors. vi) Confinement effect. Using highly porous materials, such as porous carbon, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other porous materials, to confine nanocatalysts is a regular way to protect nanoparticles from aggregation, growth and dissolution, and is an effective method to construct high-performance heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, during the process of CO2RR, confinement of the diffusion of intermediates or structure evolution of catalysts can be also realized via rational structural design. As a result, a high electrocatalytic performance will be achieved due to the increase of surface intermediates concentration and enhanced structural stability.","output":"2.

These factors contribute to the high acidity and selectivity of formic acid as the major product over Bi-based catalysts. 2.2.

La première étape est de réaliser un diagramme des flux. On identifie les acteurs du système, tels que les clients, les employés de l'agence et les prestataires de services (compagnies aériennes, hôtels, etc.). On représente les différents flux d'informations entre ces acteurs, comme par exemple le client qui effectue une recherche de destination, l'employé qui propose des offres correspondantes, le client qui réserve un vol, etc. Ensuite, on passe à la modélisation des données avec le diagramme conceptuel des données (DCD). On identifie les entités principales, comme par exemple les clients, les destinations, les offres de voyage, etc. On définit les attributs associés à chaque entité, tels que le nom, l'adresse, le prix, etc. On spécifie également les relations entre les entités, comme par exemple un client peut effectuer plusieurs réservations, une destination peut être associée à plusieurs offres, etc. Une fois le DCD réalisé, on peut passer à la modélisation du processus avec le diagramme des flux de données (DFD). On représente les différents processus du système, tels que la recherche d'offres, la réservation d'un voyage, le paiement, etc. On indique les flux d'informations entre ces processus, ainsi que les fichiers de données utilisés.
