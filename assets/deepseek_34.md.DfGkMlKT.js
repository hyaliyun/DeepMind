Employers can help reduce burnout by setting clear expectations, promoting worklife balance, and providing resources for mental health support.","output":"The rise of remote work caused by the pandemic has brought some positive changes in the work environment. However, it has also led to an increase in burnout cases among employees. According to a recent survey, more than 50% of remote workers have experienced burnout during this period. There are several reasons why remote workers are more prone to burnout. The blurring of boundaries between work and home is a major factor. Working from home can make it hard for employees to disconnect from work, leading to longer working hours and a lack of work-life balance. Additionally, increased workloads and the pressure to meet targets and deadlines can be overwhelming, leading to physical and mental exhaustion. Employers have a critical role to play in preventing burnout among remote workers. Clear communication and setting expectations can help reduce uncertainty and prevent overworking. Promoting work-life balance and encouraging employees to take breaks and practice self-care can also go a long way in reducing burnout rates. Employers can also provide resources for mental health support, such as Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). EAPs can give employees access to confidential counseling services and other support, including tips on managing stress and anxiety. In conclusion, the rise of remote work has led to an increase in burnout cases, but employers can take steps to reduce these rates. By setting clear expectations, promoting work-life balance, and providing mental health support, employers can help employees maintain their well-being while working from home."},{"instruction":"What is the tallest mountain in the world?

In some areas, gusts of wind have reached up to 70 mph, which has made it nearly impossible for helicopters and planes to safely drop water and flame retardants from the air. Despite the challenges, firefighters and emergency responders have been working tirelessly to contain the fires and evacuate residents in affected areas. Many have been forced to abandon their homes and leave behind their possessions as they work to evacuate safely. The state has also called upon additional resources from surrounding states to help combat the fires and provide relief to those affected. California's wildfires have become an all too common occurrence in recent years, with many experts citing climate change and poor land management practices as contributing factors. While the state is taking steps to address these issues, the immediate priority remains protecting people and property from the current fires. In the face of these challenges, Californians have come together to support each other in their time of need. Volunteers and organizations have stepped up to provide shelter, food, and other necessities to those displaced by the fires. The state's resilience and determination in the face of these natural disasters serve as a testament to the strength of the community. Overall, the situation in California remains critical, with many fires still burning out of control. However, with continued firefighting efforts and support from the community, the state is sure to overcome these challenges and rebuild in the wake of this devastating season."},{"instruction":"A study found that people who meditate regularly reported experiencing less stress.

According to the study, regular exercise can improve mood and reduce stress levels. But what types of exercise are most beneficial? The answer is that any type of exercise that gets the heart rate up can be beneficial. This can include activities such as jogging, cycling, swimming, or even brisk walking. Weight training and yoga can also be beneficial for physical and mental health. The duration and frequency of exercise also play a role in the results. The study found that exercising for at least 30 minutes a day, three to five times a week, can improve mental health. However, even shorter bouts of exercise, such as 10 minutes at a time, can also be beneficial. It's important to note that exercise alone may not be enough to treat major mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, but it can be an effective tool in managing symptoms alongside therapy and medication. So, how long does it take to see results? The good news is that the benefits of exercise can be seen almost immediately. Even a single workout can improve mood and reduce stress levels. However, the long-term benefits of regular exercise for mental health can take a few weeks to become noticeable. In conclusion, regular exercise can have significant benefits for mental health. Any type of exercise that gets the heart rate up can be beneficial, and even short bouts of exercise can be effective. It's important to note that exercise alone may not be enough to treat major mental health disorders, but it can be an effective tool in managing symptoms.

Jazz quickly became a cultural phenomenon, finding its way into numerous venues such as dance halls, clubs, and even traditional orchestras. Famous jazz musicians: Several famous jazz musicians made indelible contributions to the genre. Louis Armstrong, often referred to as the \\"father of jazz,\\" was instrumental in popularizing jazz among mainstream audiences, while Duke Ellington, with his sophisticated compositions and arrangement techniques, elevated jazz to the level of art. Other notable jazz musicians include Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald. Sub-genres of jazz music: Over time, jazz music evolved to include various sub-genres, each with its distinct characteristics.

AGAINST: - Standardized testing can lead to a narrow focus on test content and neglect of other important areas of learning, such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. - High-stakes testing can increase stress and anxiety for both students and teachers, and can also lead to teaching to the test rather than fostering a love of learning. - Standardized testing may not be culturally responsive or fair to all students, and can exacerbate existing inequities. - Results from standardized testing may not accurately reflect student learning or teacher effectiveness.

The report attributes the increase to the economic impact of the COVID19 pandemic, which has led to widespread job loss and financial hardship for many Americans.","output":"According to a new report recently published by a non-profit organization, the poverty rate in the United States has increased in the past year, with millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The report, based on data collected in 2020, found that the poverty rate had risen from 10.5% in 2019 to 11.3% in 2020. This translates to over 3 million people who have fallen below the poverty line in the past year alone. The report attributes the increase in poverty to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Americans have lost their jobs or have experienced a significant reduction in income due to business closures and reductions. The pandemic has also affected the labor market, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat in the current economic climate. This has led to widespread financial hardship and insecurity for many Americans, particularly those who were already living in poverty before the pandemic hit. The report suggests that the increase in poverty has been particularly acute among certain groups, including women, people of color, and those with disabilities. These populations have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with higher rates of job loss and a greater likelihood of living in low-income households. The findings of this report are concerning, particularly as the United States continues to grapple with the ongoing impacts of the pandemic. Many Americans are still struggling to make ends meet, and the long-term economic fallout from COVID-19 is likely to have a lasting impact on the country's most vulnerable populations.

Chamisa's party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), claimed the election was rigged and accused the ruling party, ZANU-PF, of vote-rigging and intimidation. The election was the first since the ouster of long-time leader Robert Mugabe in November 2017. Incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was a former ally of Mugabe, won the election with 50.8% of the vote, while Chamisa received 44.3%. However, the opposition leader has rejected the result and said he has evidence of widespread election irregularities. Chamisa's legal team filed their petition at the Constitutional Court, which has 14 days to deliver a verdict. If the court rules against Chamisa, Mnangagwa's victory will stand and he will be inaugurated as president. The MDC has said it will respect the court's decision but has also threatened to hold protests if they believe justice has not been served. The election was initially praised for being peaceful, but shortly after the results were announced, the military was deployed to quell protests which turned violent, leaving six people dead. The government has since been accused of human rights abuses and media repression. The court challenge is seen as a critical test for Zimbabwe's young democracy and its ability to hold free and fair elections.

However, the CDC notes that some settings, such as public transportation and healthcare facilities, may still require masks and other safety measures. The announcement has been met with both praise and concern, with some experts warning that the move may be premature given the ongoing threat of new variants. What are the new guidelines from the CDC regarding mask wearing and physical distancing for fully vaccinated Americans? Are there any exceptions to the new guidelines, and if so, what are they? What is the current vaccination rate in the United States? What impact is the new CDC guidance likely to have on businesses and public spaces? What are some of the concerns that experts have raised about the move to loosen mask mandates? What should fully vaccinated individuals do if they are unsure about whether to wear a mask in a particular setting? What messaging, if any, should the government be promoting around the importance of getting vaccinated? How can public health officials work to address vaccine hesitancy in the United States? What more needs to be done to ensure a safe and effective rollout of COVID19 vaccines worldwide? What lessons can be learned from the COVID19 pandemic in terms of global health preparedness?","output":"The new CDC guidelines have sparked a debate among lawmakers and business owners about how to enforce the new rules and ensure the safety of everyone in public spaces."},{"instruction":"[header] How to apply makeup [title] Moisturize your face.

(HRR), Geboren im 12. Jahrhundert, Gestorben 1190, Graf (Burgund), Herrscher (12. Jahrhundert), Herrscher des Mittelalters, Herzog (Schwaben), Kaiser (HRR), Kreuzfahrer (Dritter Kreuzzug)], Friedrich I., genannt Barbarossa (italienisch für „Rotbart“) (* um 1122; † 10. Juni 1190 im Fluss Saleph nahe Seleucia, Kleinarmenien), aus dem Adelsgeschlecht der Staufer war von 1147 bis 1152 als \\"Friedrich III.\\" Herzog von Schwaben, von 1152 bis 1190 römisch-deutscher König und von 1155 bis 1190 Kaiser des römisch-deutschen Reiches., Barbarossas Wahl war die Folge eines Interessenausgleichs mehrerer Fürsten. Die wohl bedeutendste Rolle spielte dabei sein Vetter Heinrich der Löwe, der als Folge der Absprachen eine königgleiche Stellung in Norddeutschland aufbauen konnte. Seine langjährige Förderung durch den König missachtete jedoch das Gleichgewicht hocharistokratischer Familienverbände und ließ Heinrich schließlich zum Störfaktor für die übrigen Reichsfürsten werden., Barbarossas Herrschaft war zudem vom Doppelkonflikt mit dem lombardischen Städtebund und dem Papsttum geprägt. In einer Gesellschaft, in der Ehre \\"(honor)\\" den sozialen Rang bestimmte, führten Ehrverletzungen und der daraus resultierende Zwang zur Rache zu jahrzehntelangen Konflikten. In den Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den oberitalienischen Städten versuchte Barbarossa eine Vermittlerrolle einzunehmen. Er scheiterte jedoch, zog sich den Vorwurf der Parteilichkeit zu und konnte die traditionellen Herrscheraufgaben der Friedens- und Rechtswahrung nicht ausüben. Die Weigerung einiger Städte, sich dem kaiserlichen Gericht zu stellen, musste angesichts des Konzepts der „Ehre des Reiches“ \\"(honor imperii)\\" aber auch zur Bestätigung des kaiserlichen Herrschaftsanspruchs gesühnt werden. Nachdem Tortona und Mailand zerstört worden waren, beabsichtigte Barbarossa die Königsherrschaft im Regnum Italicum grundsätzlich neu zu ordnen. Alte Hoheitsrechte des Reiches wurden wieder beansprucht oder neu definiert und schriftlich fixiert. Alle Gerichtshoheit und Amtsgewalt sollte vom Reich ausgehen. Die Einsetzung kaiserlicher Verwalter und die umfassende finanzielle Nutzung der dem Kaiser zugesprochenen Regalien trafen jedoch auf den Widerstand der Städte. Sie hatten Regalien und Jurisdiktionsrechte längst schon gewohnheitsrechtlich wahrgenommen., Anders als noch in salischer Zeit führten der Konflikt mit dem Papst und die Exkommunikation des Kaisers nicht zur Entstehung einer größeren Oppositionsbewegung im nördlichen Reichsteil. Erst nach der Niederlage des kaiserlichen Heeres in der Schlacht von Legnano 1176 wurde das jahrzehntelange Schisma im Frieden von Venedig und der Konflikt mit den Kommunen im Konstanzer Frieden 1183 beendet. Heinrich der Löwe hatte sich geweigert, dem Kaiser 1176 im Kampf gegen die lombardischen Städte beizustehen; auf Bestreben der Fürsten wurde er gestürzt und musste ins Exil gehen., Schon vor seiner Königsherrschaft hatte Barbarossa von 1147 bis 1149 am Kreuzzug seines königlichen Onkels Konrad III. teilgenommen. In seinen letzten Jahren bereitete er nach der Niederlage des Königs von Jerusalem, Guido von Lusignan, gegen Saladin 1187 einen weiteren Kreuzzug vor. Am 11. Mai 1189 brach der Kaiser auf, doch er ertrank dreizehn Monate später kurz vor seinem Ziel., Der Beiname „Barbarossa“ („Rotbart“) wurde erst im 13. Jahrhundert fester Namensbestandteil. Im Rahmen der deutschen Nationalbewegung des 19. Jahrhunderts entwickelte sich Friedrich Barbarossa zum nationalen Mythos. Mit der Sage vom Kaiser, der im Kyffhäuser schläft und auf bessere Zeiten wartet, wurde die Hoffnung auf die nationale Einheit verbunden., Leben., Herkunft und Aufstieg der Staufer., Friedrich entstammte dem adligen Geschlecht der Staufer. Dieser Name ist jedoch eine Begriffsfindung der Historiker aus dem 15. Jahrhundert. Die Ahnen väterlicherseits waren unbedeutend und wurden nicht überliefert. Abstammung und Herkunft der Familie sind bis heute ungeklärt. Der Familie gelang es durch konsequente Nutzung von Klostervogteien, kluge Inanspruchnahme der Ministerialität und enge Zusammenarbeit mit Klerus und Volk der Bistümer Würzburg, Worms und Speyer ihre Herrschaftsposition vor Antritt des Königtums auszubauen. Für das Anwachsen der staufischen Macht waren auch zahlreiche Eheschließungen vorteilhaft. Über Barbarossas Urgroßvater Friedrich von Büren ist lediglich bekannt, dass er eine Frau namens Hildegard geheiratet hat. Jüngst wurde vermutet, dass der Schlettstädter Besitz nicht Hildegard, sondern Friedrich selbst gehört habe und die Staufer damit ein elsässisches Geschlecht gewesen seien. Erst um 1100 habe sich mit Herzog Friedrich I. der Ausgriff ins ostschwäbische Remstal vollzogen., Weit wichtiger war für die Staufer ihre prestigeträchtige Verwandtschaft mütterlicherseits mit den Saliern. Die Großmutter Friedrich Barbarossas war Agnes, eine Tochter des salischen Herrschers Heinrich IV. Barbarossa verstand sich als Nachkomme des ersten Salierkaisers Konrad II., auf den er sich in Urkunden mehrfach als seinen Vorfahren bezog. Der Aufstieg der Staufer vollzog sich in den Konflikten Heinrichs IV. mit den Fürsten aus Sachsen und Schwaben. Als Reaktion auf die Erhebung des Schwabenherzogs Rudolf von Rheinfelden zum Gegenkönig Heinrichs IV. erhielt Friedrich I. vom König 1079 das Herzogtum Schwaben und wurde mit dessen Tochter Agnes vermählt. Als Schwiegersohn war Friedrich eine wichtige Stütze für den salischen Kaiser gegen die geistlichen und weltlichen Vertreter der gregorianischen Reform. 1105 bekam sein fünfzehnjähriger Sohn Friedrich II., der Vater von Barbarossa, das Herzogtum. Nach dem Sturz des Kaisers durch seinen Sohn Heinrich V. übernahmen 1116 die beiden Brüder Konrad und Friedrich II. die Stellvertreterschaft im nördlichen Reichsteil. Konrad wurde Herzog von Ostfranken. Barbarossas Vater Friedrich II. war in der Verteidigung der salischen Interessen und dem weiteren Ausbau seiner staufischen Hausmacht so erfolgreich, dass über ihn laut Otto von Freising erzählte wurde, er habe am Schwanz seines Pferdes stets eine Burg hinter sich hergezogen., Um 1122 wurde Barbarossa als Sohn Friedrichs II. und der Welfin Judith geboren. Sein Geburtsort war vielleicht Hagenau. Er erlernte das Reiten, Jagen und den Umgang mit Waffen. Barbarossa konnte weder lesen noch schreiben und war auch der lateinischen Sprache nicht mächtig. Die Kandidatur seines Vaters Friedrich II. als Nachfolger des kinderlos verstorbenen salischen Herrschers Heinrich V. blieb 1125 erfolglos, da er die \\"libera electio\\" (freie Wahl) der Fürsten nicht akzeptierte. Gewählt wurde stattdessen der Sachsenherzog Lothar III. Nach dem Tod Lothars wurde am 7. März 1138 Konrad in Koblenz von einer kleinen Fürstengruppe unter der Leitung des Erzbischofs Albero von Trier zum König gewählt. Friedrich Barbarossa nahm 1141 in Straßburg, 1142 in Konstanz, 1143 in Ulm, 1144 in Würzburg und 1145 in Worms an Hoftagen seines königlichen Onkels Konrad teil. Auch in den Folgejahren hielt er sich regelmäßig am Königshof auf. Um 1147 heiratete er Adela, die Tochter des nordbayerischen Markgrafen Diepold III. von Vohburg. Wenige Wochen vor dem Tod seines Vaters wurde Barbarossa zu Weihnachten 1146 in einer königlichen Urkunde als „der jüngere Herzog“ bezeichnet. Von 1147 bis 1149 nahm er am Kreuzzug seines königlichen Onkels Konrad teil. Das Unternehmen schlug fehl, der König erkrankte an der Malaria. Zur Jahreswende 1151/52 traf Konrad Vorbereitungen für die Königswahl seines Sohnes Friedrich von Rothenburg, starb jedoch schon am 15. Februar 1152., Königswahl (1152)., Bereits zwei Wochen nach dem Tod Konrads wählten die Fürsten am 4. März 1152 in Frankfurt am Main seinen Neffen Herzog Friedrich III. von Schwaben, den Sohn des Thronkandidaten von 1125, zum neuen König. Otto von Freising zeichnet das Bild einer einmütigen Königserhebung und zwangsläufigen Nachfolge Friedrichs. Friedrich sei gewählt worden, da er den beiden verfeindeten Familien der \\"Heinrici de Gueibelinga\\" (Heinriche von Waiblingen) und der \\"Guelfi de Aldorfio\\" (Welfen von Altdorf) angehöre; er sei damit der „Eckstein“ \\"(angularis lapis)\\" der Versöhnung geworden. Tatsächlich dürfte es jedoch vor der Wahl intensive Verhandlungen, Zugeständnisse und Absprachen zwischen Friedrich und den Großen gegeben haben. Als Herzog von Schwaben musste Barbarossa seine Erhöhung zum König seinen Standesgenossen hinnehmbar machen. Die Unterstützung Heinrichs des Löwen gewann er wohl durch die Zusage, ihm das Herzogtum Bayern zurückzugeben. Auf Konrads letztem Hoftag gelang es Barbarossa, sich die Unterstützung des Bamberger Bischofs Eberhard II. zu sichern. Eberhard hoffte dadurch Bambergs kirchenrechtliche Stellung gegenüber Mainzer Ansprüchen zu wahren. Welf VI. versprach sich vom künftigen König, seinem Neffen, die Sicherung seiner herzoglichen Stellung. Sie wurde durch die Einsetzung als Herzog von Spoleto, Markgraf der Toskana und Fürst von Sardinien \\"(dux Spoletanus et marchio Tusciae et princeps Sardiniae)\\" noch im selben Jahr gefestigt. Durch die Wahl wurde Konrads minderjähriger Königssohn Friedrich bei der Königswahl übergangen – der erste Fall dieser Art bei Königswahlen. Vor diesem Hintergrund bemerkte Otto von Freising in seinem Bericht über die Frankfurter Königswahl von 1152 ausdrücklich, dass die Wahl des Königs ein besonderer Vorzug des römisch-deutschen Reichs sei., Friedrich wurde am 9. März 1152 von Erzbischof Arnold von Köln in der Aachener Münsterkirche Karls des Großen gekrönt. Während der Zeremonie warf sich ein Ministeriale, dem Barbarossa aufgrund schwerer Vergehen die Gunst entzogen hatte, dem frisch gesalbten König in aller Öffentlichkeit vor die Füße. Der Ministeriale wollte dadurch die Wiederaufnahme in die Huld des Herrschers erreichen. Er wurde jedoch von Friedrich mit der Begründung abgewiesen, dass er ihn nicht aus Hass, sondern aus Gerechtigkeitsgründen von seiner Huld ausgeschlossen habe \\"(non ex odio, sed iustitie intuitu illum a gratia sua exclusum fuisse)\\". Die Entscheidung überraschte die meisten der Anwesenden und erhielt ihren Respekt. Die Reaktion Barbarossas wird von der modernen Forschung als Ausdruck des Wandels bei der Einschätzung der Frage gewertet, welche Tugenden von einem Herrscher erwartet wurden. Waren in ottonisch-salischer Zeit Milde und Barmherzigkeit mit ihren demonstrativen Ausdrucksformen wie Tränen und Friedenskuss Werte, an denen königliches Handeln gemessen wurde, so war nun der \\"rigor iustitiae\\" (Strenge der Gerechtigkeit) zum Maßstab für die Bewertung des Herrsc: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Friedrich I. - Herzog Schwaben - Kaiser Barbarossa - lombardischer Städtebund - Papsttum - Kreuzzug - salischer Zeit - nationale Einheit - Staufer - Königswahl"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Familienmitglied der Staufer, Friedrich II.

Dezember 1194 in Jesi bei Ancona, Reichsitalien; † 13. Dezember 1250 in Castel Fiorentino bei Lucera, Königreich Sizilien) aus dem Adelsgeschlecht der Staufer war ab 1198 König von Sizilien, ab 1212 römisch-deutscher König und von 1220 bis zu seinem Tod Kaiser des römisch-deutschen Reiches. Außerdem führte er ab 1225 den Titel „König von Jerusalem“. Von seinen 39 Regierungsjahren als römisch-deutscher Herrscher hielt er sich 28 Jahre in Italien auf., Nach dem Tod seines Vaters, des römisch-deutschen Kaisers Heinrich VI., gelang Friedrich die Vereinigung seines Nord- und Südreiches \\"(unio regni ad imperium)\\". Im Reich nördlich der Alpen konnte er sich gegen Otto IV. durchsetzen und den seit 1198 anhaltenden Thronstreit mit den Welfen beenden. Friedrich machte den Reichsfürsten nördlich der Alpen durch das \\"Statutum in favorem principum\\" („Statut zu Gunsten der Fürsten“) und die \\"Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis\\" („Bündnis mit den Fürsten der Kirche“) zahlreiche Zugeständnisse. Im Südreich hingegen wurde unter seiner Herrschaft die königliche Zentralgewalt durch eine territoriale Verwaltung und Gesetzgebung gestärkt. 1224 gründete er zu diesem Zweck die Universität Neapel. 1231 wurde mit den Konstitutionen von Melfi die erste weltliche Rechtskodifikation des Mittelalters erlassen. Mit Friedrich endete die arabische Besiedlung Siziliens, die Eingliederung der Insel in den westlich-abendländischen Kulturraum wurde vollendet. Ein Netz von Kastellen in Süditalien und bedeutende Bauten wie das Castel del Monte dienten der Herrschaftsrepräsentation und -legitimation. Sein Hof entwickelte sich zu einem bedeutenden Zentrum der Dichtung und Wissenschaft. Seiner Vorliebe für die Falknerei folgend verfasste er sein berühmtes Werk \\"De arte venandi cum avibus\\" („Über die Kunst mit Vögeln zu jagen“)., Einen 1215 zugesagten Aufbruch zum Kreuzzug verschob Friedrich wegen der Reorganisation seines Königreiches Sizilien mehrfach, weswegen ihn Papst Gregor IX. 1227 exkommunizierte. Obwohl Friedrich dadurch aus der Gemeinschaft der Christenheit ausgeschlossen war, gewann er auf seinem Kreuzzug 1228/29 die wichtigsten Pilgerstätten kampflos wieder. 1230 gelang ein zeitweiliger Ausgleich mit dem Papst, aus dem die Aufhebung der Exkommunikation resultierte., In Norditalien konnte Friedrich II. gegenüber den aufstrebenden Kommunen nicht die traditionellen Herrscheraufgaben der Friedens- und Rechtswahrung wahrnehmen. In einer Gesellschaft, in der Ehre \\"(honor)\\" den sozialen Rang bestimmte, entfachten Ehrverletzungen und der daraus resultierende Zwang zum Erfolg eine für Friedrich nicht mehr zu bewältigende Herrschaftskrise. Die Auseinandersetzungen mit den Kommunen standen in engem Zusammenhang mit dem 1239 erneut ausbrechenden Konflikt mit dem Papsttum. Auf dem Konzil von Lyon 1245 wurde Kaiser Friedrich für abgesetzt erklärt. Der Machtkampf zwischen weltlichem und geistlichem Oberhaupt wurde in bislang unbekanntem Ausmaß als Kampf der Kanzleien geführt. Friedrichs Konflikt mit den Päpsten Gregor IX. (1227–1241) und Innozenz IV. (1243–1254) verhinderte auch ein gemeinsames Vorgehen gegen die drohende Mongolengefahr. Allgemein breitete sich obendrein eine immer stärker werdende Endzeitstimmung aus, während die Exkommunikation zunehmend die auf persönlicher Treue beruhenden Bindungen seiner Herrschaft auflöste. Im römisch-deutschen Reich wurden unter Friedrich II. die Gegenkönige Heinrich Raspe und Wilhelm von Holland gewählt. In Sizilien kam es zu zahlreichen Verschwörungen und Attentatsversuchen., Mit dem Tod des letzten staufischen Kaisers lässt die Geschichtswissenschaft das Spätmittelalter beginnen. Die päpstliche Propaganda verteufelte Friedrich als Kirchenverfolger und Ketzer, Atheisten, Antichrist oder als Bestie der Johannes-Apokalypse. Bei seinen Anhängern und Zeitgenossen galt Friedrich hingegen als das „Staunen der Welt“, auch das „Wunder der Welt“ \\"(stupor mundi)\\" oder „der größte unter den Fürsten der Erde“ \\"(principum mundi maximus)\\"., Seit dem späten 13. Jahrhundert trat eine Vielzahl an „falschen Friedrichen“ auf, die behaupteten, der zurückgekehrte Staufer zu sein. Bei den national gesinnten deutschen Humanisten wurde sein Großvater Friedrich „Barbarossa“ aufgewertet, die Bedeutung Friedrichs II. nahm ab. In Italien blieb das Friedrich-Bild durch die päpstliche Propaganda lange Zeit negativ. Erst in der Epoche des Risorgimento wurde Friedrich im Ringen um eine nationale Einigung als „Vater des ghibellinischen Vaterlandes“ gefeiert. In seiner 1927 veröffentlichten Biographie stilisierte Ernst Kantorowicz den Staufer in Deutschland zu einer idealen Herrscherpersönlichkeit. Dieses Friedrich-Bild blieb bis Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts prägend und wurde erst seitdem langsam von einer nüchterneren Betrachtungsweise abgelöst., Leben bis zur Kaiserkrönung (1194–1220)., Herkunft und Jugend., Friedrich wurde am 26. Dezember 1194 in der mittelitalienischen Stadt Jesi in der Mark Ancona geboren. Er entstammte dem adligen Geschlecht, das später, ab dem 15. Jahrhundert, „Staufer“ genannt wurde., Von besonderer Bedeutung für die Staufer in einer rangbetonten Gesellschaft war ihre prestigeträchtige Verwandtschaft mütterlicherseits mit den Saliern. Der Großvater Friedrichs II., Friedrich „Barbarossa“, verstand sich als Nachkomme des ersten Salierkaisers Konrad II., auf den er sich in Urkunden mehrfach als seinen Vorfahren bezog. Nach dem Aussterben der Salier im Mannesstamm 1125 erhoben die Staufer zuerst durch Herzog Friedrich II. von Schwaben und dann durch Konrad III. vergeblich Anspruch auf die Königswürde. Erst durch die Wahl Konrads III. zum König im Jahr 1138 stiegen die Staufer zu einer Königsfamilie auf. 1152 ging die Königswürde reibungslos auf Konrads Neffen Friedrich „Barbarossa“ über, der 1155 auch Kaiser des römisch-deutschen Reiches wurde. „Barbarossa“ führte über Jahrzehnte einen Konflikt mit Papst Alexander III. und den oberitalienischen Kommunen. In der personalen Rang- und Herrschaftsordnung des frühen und hohen Mittelalters spielte die Ehre \\"(honor)\\" eine besondere Rolle. Ehrverletzungen des Reichsoberhauptes waren zugleich eine Verletzung der Würde des Reiches. Die Wahrung der „Ehre des Reiches“ \\"(Honor Imperii)\\", die der Kaiser durch das Auftreten des Kardinals Roland und späteren Papstes Alexander III. angegriffen sah, und die Pflicht, Ehrverletzungen zu rächen, führten zu langwierigen Konflikten mit dem Papsttum. Erst 1177 konnte der Konflikt im Frieden von Venedig beigelegt werden. Gegenüber den oberitalienischen Städten waren die kaiserlichen Rechte (Regalien), die Friedrich I. stärker beanspruchte als seine Vorgänger, der Anlass für jahrzehntelange Konflikte. Im Konstanzer Frieden konnte mit den Städten 1183 ein Ausgleich gefunden werden. Die Probleme mit den im Hochmittelalter wirtschaftlich immer stärker und selbständiger werdenden Kommunen Oberitaliens sollten auch die Herrschaftszeit Friedrichs II. erheblich belasten., Mitte der 1180er Jahre gelang „Barbarossa“ die Vermählung seines Sohnes Heinrich mit der Normannenprinzessin Konstanze von Hauteville, der Tochter von Siziliens erstem normannischen König Roger II. Heinrich beabsichtigte die Verbindung des Imperiums mit dem sizilischen Regnum \\"(unio regni ad imperium)\\". Seine bis dahin kinderlos gebliebene Gemahlin Konstanze brachte 1194 nach achtjähriger Ehe und mit fast vierzig Lebensjahren Friedrich zur Welt. Aus diesen Gründen kursierten um die Geburt viele Gerüchte und Legenden. Den Gegnern des Staufers zufolge war Friedrich väterlicherseits gar nicht königlicher Abstammung, sondern der untergeschobene Sohn eines Metzgers, eines Falkners oder Müllers gewesen. Nach dem Florentiner Chronisten Ricordano Malispini (um 1282) soll Konstanze, um ihre Mutterschaft zu beweisen, den Sohn öffentlich auf einem Marktplatz in einem Zelt zur Welt gebracht haben. Die antikaiserlichen Aussagen werden in der Forschung aber als wenig glaubwürdig eingestuft., Friedrich wurde bereits nach drei Monaten der Herzogin von Spoleto übergeben. Ihr Mann Konrad von Urslingen gehörte zu den engsten Vertrauten Heinrichs VI. Am Herzogshof in Foligno verbrachte Friedrich seine ersten Lebensjahre. Um Weihnachten 1196 wählten die Fürsten in Frankfurt den gerade zweijährigen Königssohn in Abwesenheit zum römisch-deutschen König \\"(rex Romanorum)\\". Sein Vater wollte mit dieser Wahl vor dem Aufbruch zu seinem Kreuzzug seine Nachfolge geregelt wissen. Nach dem unerwarteten Tod des Vaters in Messina kam der fast dreijährige Friedrich, dessen Krönung zum römisch-deutschen König nicht mehr erfolgt war, im Herbst 1197 an den Hof nach Palermo. Am 17. Mai 1198 wurde er im Dom von Palermo zum König von Sizilien gekrönt. Gleichzeitig mit der Krönung zum König von Sizilien verzichtete Konstanze für Friedrich auf den Titel \\"rex Romanorum\\", da der Papst eine Doppelherrschaft des nordalpinen Reiches und Siziliens befürchtete., Mit knapp vier Jahren verlor Friedrich am 27. November 1198 auch seine Mutter Konstanze. Friedrich war Vollwaise, woraufhin Papst Innozenz III. die Vormundschaft übernahm. Es brachen innere Machtkämpfe zwischen den rivalisierenden Parteien um die Leitung der Regierung aus. In den folgenden Jahren versuchten der Kanzler Walter von Pagliara, normannische Barone, päpstliche Legaten und Vertraute des verstorbenen Kaisers Heinrich VI. durch die Kontrolle über den kleinen Friedrich die Herrschaft auszuüben. Viele Barone nutzten die Möglichkeit, sich von der Zentralgewalt zu lösen. Die Verfügungsgewalt über den Jungen hatten Walter von Pagliara, seit November 1201 Markward von Annweiler, seit Ende 1202 Wilhelm von Capparone, vermutlich ein deutscher Heerführer, und von November 1206 bis Weihnachten 1208 wieder Walter von Pagliara., Über Friedrichs Kindheit in Palermo ist nichts weiter bekannt. Als Legende gilt, dass der junge König sich unbeaufsichtigt auf den Straßen Palermos herumgetrieben und von milden Gaben ernährt habe. Friedrich erhielt vielmehr eine ritterliche Ausbildung, erlernte zahlreiche Sprachen, Lesen, Schreiben und Jagen. Am 26. Dezember 1208 endete die Vormundschaft des Papstes. Friedrich wurde zwar nicht volljährig, trat aber in eine eingeschränkt rechtsfähige Minderjährigkeit.

The exact reasons for its color are still not completely understood, but it is believed to be a combination of factors. One possible explanation is that the reddish color is the result of complex organic molecules, such as red phosphorus or hydrocarbon compounds, produced by chemical reactions occurring in the Jovian atmosphere. These compounds interact with sunlight and the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, leading to the distinctive reddish hue. Another factor that may contribute to the color of the Great Red Spot is the presence of certain gases or atmospheric conditions. For example, the spot is located in an area with high concentrations of ammonia, which could react with other compounds to form the reddish color. It's important to note that the exact composition and behavior of Jupiter's atmosphere are still subjects of scientific study and exploration, and more research is needed to fully understand the reasons behind the color of the Great Red Spot."},{"instruction":"How big is the Great Red Spot? How many Earths can fit inside it?","output":"The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a massive storm system that has been observed for centuries. As of the latest measurements, it has an approximate diameter of around 16,350 kilometers (10,160 miles). To visualize its size, one could compare it to the diameter of Earth, which is about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles). Using these measurements, you could fit approximately 1.3 Earths across the diameter of the Great Red Spot. It is important to note that the spot's size varies over time due to the storm's dynamics and behavior. It has been observed to shrink and expand, and its shape can change.

(HRR), Geboren 1415, Gestorben 1493, Habsburger (Leopoldinische Linie), Herrscher (15. Jahrhundert), Herzog (Kärnten), Herzog (Steiermark), Kaiser (HRR), Mann, Ritter (Ritterorden vom Heiligen Grab zu Jerusalem)], Friedrich III. (* 21. September 1415 in Innsbruck; † 19. August 1493 in Linz) aus dem Hause Habsburg war als Friedrich V. ab 1424 Herzog der Steiermark, von Kärnten und Krain, ab 1439 Herzog von Österreich, als \\"Friedrich III.\\" ab 1440 römisch-deutscher König und ab 1452 bis zu seinem Tod Kaiser des Heiligen Römischen Reiches. Er war der vorletzte römisch-deutsche Kaiser, der vom Papst gekrönt wurde, und der letzte, bei dem dies in Rom geschah., Friedrichs Herrschaftszeit war die längste aller römisch-deutschen Herrscher. Unter ihm verschob sich der Herrschaftsmittelpunkt von Böhmen in die innerösterreichischen Erblande (Steiermark, Kärnten, Krain) an der südöstlichen Peripherie des Reiches. Friedrich regierte weitgehend reichsfern und war durch innerdynastische Auseinandersetzungen in seinen Erblanden gebunden. Von den 53 Herrschaftsjahren hielt sich Friedrich insgesamt nur neun Jahre außerhalb seiner Erblande auf. Während eines Zeitraums von 27 Jahren (1444–1471) verließ er seine Erblande, abgesehen von zwei Reisen nach Italien 1452 und 1468/69, überhaupt nicht., Seit den 1470er Jahren wandte er sich verstärkt dem Reich im Westen zu. Die neue Aktivität des Kaisers im Reich ging mit einem tiefgreifenden Struktur- und Verfassungswandel einher, der von der Spätmittelalterforschung als „Verdichtung“ des Reiches beschrieben wird. Durch die Anwartschaft Ungarns 1459/63 und insbesondere den Erwerb Burgunds sowie die Sicherung der Nachfolge für seinen Sohn Maximilian I. setzte Friedrich die Grundlage für den großdynastischen Aufstieg der Habsburger. Ihm gelang durch die Beerbung der Albertiner 1457/63 und der Tiroler Linie 1490 die Wiedervereinigung der seit 1379 geteilten Länder des Hauses Österreich., In der älteren Forschung wurde das Reich als durch Friedrichs Untätigkeit und Abwesenheit innerlich zerrissen und nach außen machtlos beschrieben. Friedrich galt als „des Heiligen Römischen Reiches Erzschlafmütze“, jedoch auch infolge einer stark unvollständigen Quellenlage: Bekannt waren nur etwa 8000 der geschätzten 30.000 bis 50.000 Urkunden, die er in seiner langen Herrschaftszeit hinterließ. Die bislang unbekannten Dokumente werden seit 1982 von der „Deutschen Kommission für die Bearbeitung der Regesta Imperii e. V.“ publiziert. Sie trug dazu bei, in der Forschung eine Revision der bis in die jüngste Vergangenheit sehr negativen Beurteilung Friedrichs III. und seiner Regierung einzuleiten., Leben., Herkunft., Friedrich entstammte der Familie der Habsburger. Durch die Neuberger Teilung von 1379 zwischen Albrecht III. und Leopold III. wurden die gesamten habsburgischen Länder getrennt. Friedrich gehörte der Hauptlinie der habsburgischen Leopoldiner in den innerösterreichischen Herzogtümern an. Er ging als ältester Sohn aus der zweiten Ehe von Herzog Ernst und Cimburgis von Masowien hervor. Von ihren neun Kindern erreichten neben Friedrich nur Albrecht VI., Margarete und Katharina das heiratsfähige Alter., Herzog Ernst starb, als Friedrich neun Jahre alt war. Die folgenden Jahre verbrachte Friedrich bei seiner Mutter in Graz oder Wiener Neustadt. Vormund Friedrichs und seines Bruders Albrecht wurde 1424 ihr Onkel Herzog Friedrich IV. von Tirol. Während der Vormundschaft erhielt Friedrich eine sehr gute Ausbildung, von der aber kaum Einzelheiten überliefert sind. Friedrichs Mutter verstarb 1429., Familiäre Konflikte., 1431 wurde Friedrich zwar für mündig erklärt, doch die Vormundschaft wurde um drei Jahre verlängert. 1435 trat er durch einen Schiedsspruch Herzog Albrechts V. (des späteren römisch-deutschen Königs Albrecht II.) die selbstständige Regierung als Herzog von Innerösterreich an. Nun kam es mit seinem Bruder zum Streit über die Aufteilung der Finanzmittel und über die Herrschaft. Ein am Hausvertrag Rudolfs IV. von 1364 orientierter Schiedsspruch bescheinigte 1436 Albrecht die Mitregierung, räumte aber gleichzeitig dem älteren Bruder Friedrich die Vorrangstellung ein. Der Ausgleich blieb unbefriedigend, da die Aufteilung der Einnahmen offenblieb. In dieser Situation unternahm Herzog Friedrich am 9. August 1436 als Akt christlicher Frömmigkeit von Triest aus eine Pilgerfahrt ins Heilige Land. Auf dieser Reise, von der er im Dezember 1436 zurückkehrte, konnte er eine große Zahl Adliger um sich sammeln. Rund 50 adelige Begleiter wurden zu Rittern des Heiligen Grabes geschlagen., Noch während seiner Herzogszeit ließ er 1437 das Vokal-Symbol „a-e-i-o-u“ zur Kennzeichnung seiner Besitztümer anbringen. In seinem Notizbuch sammelte er verschiedene Möglichkeiten für dessen Auflösung. Die Variante „Alles Erdreich ist Österreich untertan“ ist erst im 17. Jahrhundert aufgekommen. In der älteren Forschung galt die Vokaldevise als „eine buchstabenmagische oder zahlenmystische Spielerei“ ohne politische Bedeutung. In der neueren Forschung wird sie als Herrschaftsdevise Friedrichs gedeutet. Im Jahr 2023 wurde anhand einer Quelle gezeigt, die durch die Zensur der römischen Kanzlei Friedrichs III. ging, dass es sich um das sogenannte En-Amor Distichon handelt. Die Buchstabenfolge steht somit für die Worte: \\"En, amor electis, iniustis ordinor ultor\\" (Die Liebe der Erwählten, erwählt zum Bestrafer der Ungerechten). Lhotskys Ansicht, es handle sich um eine spätere Erfindung, wurde dabei widersprochen., Nach dem Tod Herzog Friedrichs IV. am 24. Juni 1439 musste in Tirol und in den Vorlanden die Vormundschaft über Sigmund, den zwölfjährigen Sohn des Verstorbenen, geregelt werden. In Tirol wurde sie Friedrich von seinem Bruder Albrecht VI. bestritten, doch musste Albrecht seinen Anspruch infolge der Entscheidung der Tiroler Stände vom 28. Juli 1439 aufgeben. Als Vormund konnte Friedrich Einfluss auf Tirol und die habsburgischen Vorlande nehmen. Auch in der Vormundschaft über Ladislaus Postumus, den Sohn seines königlichen Vorgängers Albrecht II., konnte er sich gegen seinen Bruder Albrecht durchsetzen. Der römisch-deutsche König Albrecht II. hatte zwar zu Lebzeiten keinen männlichen Nachfolger hinterlassen, doch als er starb, war seine Frau Elisabeth schwanger; vier Monate nach seinem Tod brachte sie Ladislaus zur Welt. Albrecht hatte kurz vor seinem Tod verfügt, dass, falls das erwartete Kind männlich wäre, die Mutter und der Älteste aus dem Haus Österreich die Vormundschaft führen sollten. Durch den Tod Herzog Friedrichs IV. 1439 nahm Friedrich III. mit vierundzwanzig Jahren diese Rolle des Seniors des Hauses Österreich ein. Der Adel entschied sich auf dieser Grundlage für Friedrich als Vormund, doch musste er den Ständen ein Mitspracherecht einräumen. Die Vormundschaft sollte die Reichsherrschaft in den folgenden Jahren entscheidend belasten. Friedrich wurde wiederholt vorgeworfen, dass er sich des Erbes seines Mündels bemächtigen wolle. Mit diesem Vorwurf wurde er erstmals im März 1444 auf einem Landtag konfrontiert., Königswahl 1440., Friedrich war als Vetter der nächste männliche Verwandte König Albrechts. Am 2. Februar 1440, dem Fest Mariae Lichtmess, wählten die Kurfürsten den 24-jährigen Herzog Friedrich V. von Österreich in Frankfurt am Main einstimmig zum römisch-deutschen König. Ob dynastische Gründe den Ausschlag gaben oder eine Alternative fehlte, ist ungewiss. Als neuer Herrscher regierte Friedrich allerdings nur die Steiermark, Kärnten und die Krain., Weg zur Kaiserkrönung (1440–1452)., Eine wichtige Aufgabe für das neue Reichsoberhaupt war die Bewältigung der Reichsreform, also die Behebung gravierender Mängel im Bereich der Gerichts-, Wehr- und Finanzverfassung durch eine Neuverteilung der Herrschaftsgewalt zwischen König und Reichsständen. Neben der Reichsreform zählten die Abwehr der Türken – das Osmanenreich eroberte große Teile des Balkans und bedrohte Konstantinopel – sowie die Beseitigung des Schismas zu den weiteren Herausforderungen. Friedrich musste jedoch zunächst sein Regiment in den Erbländern festigen. Daher konnte er seine Krönung in Aachen erst zwei Jahre später vollziehen., Streit um die Erbfolge im Königreich Ungarn und in Böhmen., In Ungarn bot der Adel dem polnischen König Władysław III. die Krone an, da man sich von ihm wirksamere Maßnahmen in der Türkenabwehr versprach. Die Königinwitwe Elisabeth versuchte die Herrschaftsnachfolge ihres Sohnes in Österreich, in Böhmen und vor allem in Ungarn zu sichern. Dadurch drohte Friedrich auch in die Wirren in Ungarn und Böhmen gezogen zu werden. Das am 22. Februar 1440 geborene Kind ließ Elisabeth auf den ungarischen Nationalheiligen Ladislaus taufen. Elisabeth ließ den nach Wien ziehenden Leichenzug Albrechts nach Ungarn umleiten und ihren Gatten in Stuhlweißenburg inmitten seiner ungarischen Vorgänger seit Stephan I. beisetzen. Ihr gelang es außerdem, mit der Stephanskrone das wichtigste Herrschaftssymbol des Landes zu entwenden und ihren Sohn Ladislaus im Mai 1440 in Stuhlweißenburg zum König von Ungarn zu krönen. Als Friedrich nicht für sein Mündel in Ungarn Partei ergriff, wollte Elisabeth die Vormundschaftsregierung an Friedrichs Bruder Albrecht übertragen. Dadurch loderte der Streit zwischen den beiden Brüdern um die Vormundschaft wieder auf. Bedrängt durch die Erfolge Władysławs gegen die Ungarn näherte sich Elisabeth wieder stärker Friedrich an. In Verhandlungen konnte am 23. August 1440 eine Einigung erzielt werden, die die Habsburger einbezog. Die Vormundschaft über Ladislaus blieb bei Friedrich, Albrecht wurden 10.000 Dukaten zugesichert und fünf Städte (Bleiburg, Windischgratz, Fürstenfeld, Völkermarkt und Judenburg) übergeben. Doch erst als Władysław auf einem Feldzug gegen die Türken in der Schlacht von Varna gefallen war, wurde Ladislaus am 7. Mai 1445 auf einem Reichstag in Pest formell als ungarischer König anerkannt. Die eigentliche Regierung blieb jedoch bei dem von den ungarischen Ständen am 6. Juni 1446 gewählten Reichsverweser Johann Hunyadi. Für die Krönung sollte Ladislaus nun persönlich nach Ungarn kommen. Friedrich verweigerte jedoch Ladislaus’ Auslieferung. Hunyadi fiel daraufhin in Österreich ein, doch sah er sich, bedingt durch die verlustreichen Kämpfe gegen die Türken in der Schlacht auf dem Amselfeld vom 18. Oktober 1448, zu einem Ausgleich mit dem Habsburger gezwungen. Der am 22.

United States refers to a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1895. It involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the Federal Income Tax Act of 1894. The specific issue in the case was whether the act violated the Constitution's requirement that direct taxes be apportioned among the states based on population. The Court, in a 5-4 decision, held that the tax was unconstitutional as it violated the requirement of apportionment. The decision was significant because it marked the first time the Court struck down an income tax law, which had a major impact on future attempts to impose income taxes. However, this decision was later overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, which explicitly allowed Congress to levy an income tax without apportionment among the states."},{"instruction":"what was knaps battery in the civil war","output":"Knaps Battery, also known as Knapp's Battery or Knaps' Battery, was a Union artillery battery that served during the American Civil War.

Jahrhundert, Gestorben 1414, Herzog (Westfalen), Kurfürst (Köln), Mann, Römisch-katholischer Bischof (14. Jahrhundert), Römisch-katholischer Bischof (15. Jahrhundert)], Friedrich von Saarwerden (* um 1348 in Saarwerden; † 9. April 1414 in Bonn) war als Friedrich III. von 1370 bis 1414 Erzbischof von Köln. Durch die Förderung seines Großonkels, des Trierer Erzbischofs Kuno II. von Falkenstein, wurde Friedrich von Saarwerden schon mit 20 Jahren zum Erzbischof von Köln gewählt, was der Papst in Avignon nach einigen Bedenken auch zwei Jahre später bestätigte. Friedrich fand das Erzbistum von seinen beiden märkischen Vorgängern Adolf und Engelbert völlig ausgeplündert vor und hatte selbst anlässlich seiner Wahl hohe Zahlungen an die Kurie zugesichert. Dennoch gelang es ihm mit Hilfe seines sehr reichen Großonkels Kuno, in wenigen Jahren das Erzbistum zu entschulden., Friedrich von Saarwerden unterstützte Kaiser Karl IV. und wurde von ihm deshalb mit Privilegien bedacht, die Friedrichs Herrschaftspolitik unterstützten. Erbkonflikte im landständischen Adel wie auch Autonomiebestrebungen in den Städten des Erzstifts unterdrückte er direkt zu Beginn seiner Amtszeit erfolgreich und setzte so seine landesherrliche Vormachtstellung durch, die bis zum Ende seiner Regierungszeit nicht mehr angefochten wurde. Einen Konflikt innerhalb der Stadt Köln zwischen dem Rat der Stadt und den Schöffen um die Hochgerichtsbarkeit konnte er aber nicht nutzen, um die von seinen Vorgängern verlorene Machtposition in der Stadt zu erneuern. Der zuletzt auch militärisch geführte Streit unter Beteiligung benachbarter Fürsten endete im Jahr 1377 mit einem Kompromiss., Den territorialen Bestand des Erzstiftes konnte Friedrich ausbauen. Noch vor Friedrichs Amtsbeginn hatte Kuno von Falkenstein als Administrator des Erzbistums im Jahr 1368 die Grafschaft Arnsberg erworben. Friedrich vermochte diesen Erwerb wie auch den Gewinn des Landes Linn am Niederrhein in drei Fehden gegenüber den beiden Grafenbrüdern Adolf und Engelbert von der Mark zu sichern. Sein Wirken als Territorialherr ist kaum zu überschätzen, wenngleich reichs- oder kirchenpolitische Initiativen dadurch in den Hintergrund gerieten., Als Friedrich III. von Saarwerden im Jahr 1414 verstarb, hinterließ er seinem Neffen und Nachfolger Dietrich II. von Moers ein reiches und wohlgeordnetes Erzbistum und Territorium., Leben und Wirken., Kindheit und Jugend., Friedrichs Eltern waren Graf Johann II. von Saarwerden und dessen Frau Klara von Finstingen. Die Grafen von Saarwerden hatten ihren Sitz im gleichnamigen Ort Sarrewerden an der oberen Saar. Während sein Bruder Heinrich zum Nachfolger in der Grafschaft bestimmt wurde, wurde Friedrich im Alter von zehn Jahren für eine Laufbahn als geistlicher und weltlicher Kirchenfürst bestimmt und deshalb in die Obhut seines Onkels 2. Grades gegeben, des Erzbischofs von Trier, Kuno II. von Falkenstein. Dieser wurde im Jahr 1366 vom Kölner Domkapitel zum Koadjutor des Kölner Erzbischofs Engelbert III. von der Mark ernannt und trachtete nun danach, seinem Neffen 2. Grades eine günstige Position in Köln zu verschaffen. So erwirkte Kuno für Friedrich einige einträgliche Kölner Pfründen, nämlich die Propstei im Stift St. Maria ad Gradus sowie ein Kanonikat. Diese Ämter brauchte er nicht persönlich wahrzunehmen, während er noch an der Universität Bologna Kanonisches Recht studierte., Ernennung zum Erzbischof von Köln., Am 25. August 1368 verstarb Erzbischof Engelbert III. Kuno von Falkenstein verwaltete das Erzstift zunächst weiter, denn das Domkapitel bestellte ihn schon am 28. August zum \\"momper\\" bzw. Administrator für die Zeit der Sedisvakanz. Sofort versuchte Kuno seinen Neffen 2. Grades Friedrich zum neuen Erzbischof aufzubauen und erreichte auch vom Domkapitel eine – wenn auch nicht einmütige – Postulation, das heißt einen Ernennungsvorschlag, denn die Einsetzung des Erzbischofs stand damals schon dem Papst zu. Papst Urban V. am Papstsitz Avignon wies dieses Ansinnen aber am 7. November 1368 zurück: Friedrich sei zu jung – er hatte das kanonische Alter von 30 noch nicht erreicht –, sei unerfahren in kirchlichen Angelegenheiten und seine Person und sein Lebenswandel der Kurie noch völlig unbekannt. Zudem wollte Kaiser Karl IV. für die geplante Wahl seines Sohnes Wenzel zum römischen König die geistlichen Kurfürstentümer mit genehmen Kandidaten besetzt wissen und bedrängte den Papst, der seinerseits auf die kaiserliche Unterstützung zur Wiedergewinnung des Kirchenstaats angewiesen war. Der Papst transferierte deshalb im Ablehnungsschreiben an Friedrich von Saarwerden dessen Großonkel Kuno von Trier nach Köln, Johann von Luxemburg-Ligny, den Verwandten und Protegé des Kaisers Karl, von Straßburg nach Trier und Friedrich von Saarwerden nach Straßburg., Kuno von Falkenstein verweigerte sich aber diesen Plänen, seinen Großneffen mit Straßburg abzufinden. Die Bistumsrotation sollte nach dem Willen des Papstes die Ansprüche aller beteiligten Parteien befriedigen, doch lehnte Kuno die Translation trotz inständiger Bitten der Kurie und auch des Kölner Domkapitels ab. Doch ernannte der Papst weder Friedrich von Saarwerden zum neuen Kölner Erzbischof noch einen anderen Kandidaten. Warum die Besetzung des Kölner Erzstuhls vorerst nicht erfolgte, ist nicht schlüssig belegt, doch spricht viel für die These, dass der Papst die mit der Besetzung verbundenen Probleme zwischen Kaiser und Kuno von Falkenstein einfach in der Schwebe halten wollte. Für die Kurie war diese Lösung die eleganteste: Den nach anderen Quellen recht unfähigen Johann von Luxemburg-Ligny beließ man im nicht so politisch exponierten Bistum Straßburg, Kuno wurde durch die Belassung dieses zweiten Kurfürstentums auf Widerruf enger an den Papst gebunden und dem Kölner Erzstift blieb ein fähiger Administrator erhalten. Ganz nebenbei konnte die Kurie so die Interkalarfrüchte – die Kölner Einkünfte während der Sedisvakanz – in der veranschlagten Höhe von 20.000 Goldgulden jährlich einstreichen. Papst Urban V. ernannte Kuno von Falkenstein deshalb am 30. Juli 1369 zum Apostolischen Vikar und am 27. März 1370 zum Apostolischen Administrator auf zwei weitere Jahre mit der Aussicht auf Verlängerung., Im Sommer 1370 veranlasste Kuno von Falkenstein eine zweite und diesmal einstimmige Supplikation des Domkapitels an den Papst um die Ernennung Friedrichs von Saarwerden. Friedrich reiste sofort an den päpstlichen Hof und gewann den Papst für sich, so dass er seine Ernennung am 13. November erhielt. Weil er in sieben Urkunden vom Februar 1371 als Erzbischof bezeichnet wird, vermutet Heinrich Volbert Sauerland, dass er in der Zwischenzeit die Diakons- und Presbyterweihe sowie die Bischofskonsekration noch in Avignon erhalten hat. Daraufhin begab er sich zurück an den Rhein, um inthronisiert zu werden. Am 20. Juni 1371 bestätigte Friedrich alle Anordnungen Kunos als rechtens, worauf Kuno am 2. Juli 1371 alle Amtleute von ihren Eiden und Pflichten ihm gegenüber entband. Friedrich empfing am 13. November 1371 durch Gesandte des Königs in Bautzen die weltlichen Regalien und auch \\"in persona\\" wohl im Mai 1372 beim Reichstag in Mainz, als er auch die Belehnung mit dem Herzogtum Westfalen erhielt. Nach seiner Rückkehr erfolgte dann der feierliche Einritt in seine Bischofsstadt am 21. Juni 1372, nachdem er schon am 30. April 1372 alle Rechte der Stadt Köln bestätigt hatte., Der wesentliche Grund, warum der Papst doch noch Friedrich von Saarwerden das Erzbistum verlieh, waren umfangreiche finanzielle Verpflichtungen des jungen Erzbischofs. Das Kölner Erzbistum war schon damals das reichste Erzbistum Deutschlands – die Kurie veranschlagte die Jahreseinnahmen auf 30.000 Goldgulden. Während der Administration Kunos konnte die Kurie 20.000 Goldgulden davon für sich reservieren. Entgegen der Gewohnheit, nur einmal eine „Ernennungsgebühr“ von einem Drittel der Jahreseinkünfte, also 10.000 Goldgulden zu zahlen, verpflichtete sich Friedrich, in sechs Jahresraten insgesamt 120.000 Goldgulden zu zahlen. Das Erzbistum war in der kurzen Zeit der beiden Vorgänger Friedrichs, Adolf von der Mark und Engelbert III. völlig ausgeplündert worden, so dass die Zahlungen an die Kurie nahezu unmöglich erschienen. Die Kurie ließ sich deshalb auch den üblichen Sanktionsmechanismus bestätigen – bei nicht erfolgter Zahlung drohte erst die Exkommunikation und danach das Interdikt als verstärkte Form., Desolater Zustand des Erzbistums bei Friedrichs Amtsantritt., Das Erzbistum Köln war zu Beginn der Herrschaft Friedrich von Saarwerdens hoch verschuldet. Es wird berichtet, dass Friedrich bei seinem Amtsantritt ein Schreiben übergeben wurde, in dem die Schulden mit mehr als 474.000 Gulden beziffert wurden. Auch wenn diese hohe Summe nicht belegt ist, so gibt der Bericht darüber doch eine Tendenz wieder. Denn erstens waren keine Barmittel mehr vorhanden und zweitens wichtige Einnahmequellen dem Erzstift entfremdet worden., Nach dem Tod von Wilhelm von Gennep 1362 war es zum Streit um das Erzbistum gekommen, weil sich sowohl zum wiederholten Male der Lütticher Bischof Engelbert von der Mark als auch dessen Neffe, der Münsteraner Elekt Adolf von der Mark, und der Domkanoniker Johann von Virneburg um den Bischofsstuhl bewarben. Während die ersten beiden Kandidaten beim Papst in Avignon um Bestätigung nachsuchten, konnte Johann bei einer turbulenten Wahl die Mehrheit des Domkapitels für sich einnehmen – eine Minderheit plädierte für Florenz von Wevelinghoven. Er besetzte sofort mit anderen Familienmitgliedern die Städte Andernach und Linz und brachte alle Barmittel des verstorbenen Erzbischofs an sich. Adolf konnte nur das Erzbistum übernehmen, indem er Johann diesen Raub am 23. Oktober 1363 zugestand., Adolf selbst machte weiterhin Schulden, bevor er schon im nächsten Jahr das Erzbistum an seinen Onkel Engelbert am 15. April 1364 „vererbte“, um Graf von Kleve werden zu können. Für diese Translation flossen nicht nur weitere Mittel aus der Kasse des Erzbistums nach Avignon, sondern der neue Erzbischof Engelbert verpfändete auch alle kurkölnischen Gebiete und Einnahmequellen nördlich von Neuss an seinen Neffen – die Ämter Kempen und Oedt sowie Zoll und Amt Rheinberg. Der Rheinzoll von Rheinberg war der ertragreichste Zoll der vier Rheinzölle des Erzbischofs und machte mit etwa 10.000 Goldgulden Einnahmen – nach Abzug von Rentenanweisungen! – etwa 60 % der Bareinnahmen des Erzbistums aus! Außerdem machte Engelbert seinen gleichnamigen Neffen zum Marschall von Westfalen und übergab ihm pfandweise das Amt Waldenburg-Schnellenberg, wodurch eigentlich ein Konkurrent um die Herrschaft in Westfalen zusätzlich gefördert wurde., Um diesen Ausverkauf des Erzbistums an Adolf von der Mark zu begrenzen, hatte d: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

However, there might be a few reasons why some people may not enjoy the show. Firstly, Yakkity Yak is a cartoon that aired from 2002 to 2003, and its target audience was children. As a result, some older viewers may find the humor or storytelling style to be too simplistic or juvenile for their tastes. Additionally, the show's animation and visual style may not appeal to everyone. Different individuals have different preferences when it comes to art and animation, so what one person finds visually appealing, another may not. Lastly, every show has its own unique humor and characters, and not everyone may connect with or find them entertaining. Comedy is subjective, and what one person finds funny, another might not. Some viewers might feel that the humor in Yakkity Yak doesn't resonate with them personally. It's essential to remember that people have different tastes and preferences, and that's what makes the world diverse and interesting.

(Pfalz), Geboren 1596, Gestorben 1632, Herrscher (17. Jahrhundert), Kurfürst (Böhmen), Kurfürst (Pfalz), Mann, Person im Dreißigjährigen Krieg (Pfalz), Ritter des Hosenbandordens], Friedrich V. (* 26. August 1596 im Jagdschloss Deinschwang; † 29. November 1632 in Mainz) aus dem Haus Wittelsbach (Linie Pfalz-Simmern) war von 1610 bis 1623 Pfalzgraf und Kurfürst von der Pfalz sowie als \\"Friedrich I.\\" von 1619 bis 1620 König von Böhmen., Bei seinem Versuch, die Kurpfalz als führende protestantische Macht im Heiligen Römischen Reich zu positionieren, verstrickte er sich in die durch religiöse Gegensätze verursachten politischen Wirren Europas. Am Vorabend des Dreißigjährigen Krieges nahm Friedrich V. die böhmische Königskrone an und stellte sich damit gegen Kaiser Ferdinand II. und Reich. Von der kaiserlichen Propaganda erhielt Friedrich V. in Erwartung seiner wohl äußerst kurzen Herrschaft den Beinamen Winterkönig, auf tschechisch \\"Zimní král\\", der nach seiner nur etwas mehr als ein Jahr dauernden Regierungszeit als König von Böhmen an ihm haften blieb. Damit zählt Friedrich V. zu den wenigen historischen Persönlichkeiten, die unter ihrem Spottnamen in die Geschichte eingegangen sind., Sein politisches Handeln hatte weitreichende und verheerende Auswirkungen auf das Reich und ganz Europa und war einer der Auslöser des Dreißigjährigen Krieges. Nach der Niederlage in der Schlacht am Weißen Berg gegen die Truppen Kaiser Ferdinands II. verlor er nicht nur das Königreich Böhmen, sondern durch die Verhängung der Reichsacht auch sein Herrschaftsgebiet, die Pfalz, sowie seine Kurwürde., Leben., Jugend., Friedrich wurde am 26. August 1596 im Jagdschloss Deinschwang als erster Sohn des pfälzischen Kurfürsten Friedrich IV. und der Prinzessin Luise Juliane von Nassau-Oranien geboren. Die Kurpfalz war zu dieser Zeit mit fast allen wichtigen Fürstenhäusern des Heiligen Römischen Reiches verwandtschaftlich verbunden. Seine Mutter war die Tochter von Wilhelm I. von Oranien-Nassau und Charlotte von Bourbon-Montpensier. Dementsprechend nahmen an seiner Taufe am 6. Oktober 1596 in Amberg viele in- und ausländische Fürsten und Diplomaten teil., Da die pfälzische Residenzstadt Heidelberg zu dieser Zeit von mehreren Pestwellen heimgesucht wurde, verbrachte Friedrich die ersten beiden Jahre in der Oberpfalz und kam erst 1598 nach Heidelberg. Die Oberpfalz oder Obere Pfalz bildete zur damaligen Zeit gemeinsam mit der Unteren Pfalz, auch als Rheinpfalz bezeichnet, die Kurpfalz. Der calvinistische Glaube des pfälzischen Zweiges der Wittelsbacher bildete einen tiefen Gegensatz zur katholischen Linie der Familie in Bayern, die zu dieser Zeit durch Herzog Maximilian I. in München repräsentiert wurde., Weil Friedrich über seine Mutter ein Neffe des Fürsten von Sedan, Heinrich von Bouillon, war, schickte man ihn ab dem Frühjahr 1604 zur Ausbildung an den Hof in Sedan. Gerne hätte auch König Heinrich IV. von Frankreich den jungen Pfalzgrafen an seinem Hofe gesehen. Für Sedan gaben neben den verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen aber vorrangig religiöse Gründe den Ausschlag, denn dort erhielt Friedrich eine streng calvinistische Ausbildung, auf die man in Heidelberg großen Wert legte. Sein Lehrer wurde der Theologe Daniel Tilenius, der dort schon seit 1559 wirkte und als Vertreter eines gemäßigten königstreuen Calvinismus galt. Tilenius war durch den Unabhängigkeitskampf der Niederlande und die Religionskriege in Frankreich geprägt und predigte eine umfassende Solidarität der protestantischen Fürsten. Er machte es sogar zu deren Christenpflicht, einzugreifen, wenn Glaubensbrüder in Gefahr waren oder von der Obrigkeit bedrängt wurden. Diese Ansichten dürften Friedrich geprägt und die theologischen Grundlagen für die spätere Politik der Kurpfalz unter seiner Regierung gebildet haben., Neben einer gründlichen theologischen Ausbildung lernte Friedrich auch Dinge, die für seine zukünftige Rolle als Kurfürst des Reiches wichtig waren. So erlernte er beispielsweise die französische Sprache, die damals auf dem Gebiet der Diplomatie wichtig war, und wurde mit der französischen Hofkultur vertraut gemacht., Streit um die Vormundschaft., Im Jahre 1610 kehrte Friedrich nach Heidelberg zurück, da am 19. September 1610 sein Vater Friedrich IV. an den Folgen seines „ausschweifenden Lebenswandels“ gestorben war. Friedrich IV. war nur 36 Jahre alt geworden, und sein früher Tod führte zu einem Konflikt mit der lutherischen Verwandtschaft der Pfalzgrafen von Pfalz-Neuburg., Nach den Bestimmungen der Goldenen Bulle von 1356 hätte die Vormundschaft über den noch minderjährigen Friedrich und die Administration der Kurpfalz dem nächsten männlichen Verwandten zugestanden. Dies war Wolfgang Wilhelm von Pfalz-Neuburg. Vor seinem Tod hatte Friedrich IV. jedoch bereits den calvinistischen Pfalzgrafen von Zweibrücken Johann II. von Pfalz-Zweibrücken als Vormund und Kuradministrator bestimmt., Dementsprechend wurde Friedrich V. im Herbst 1610 von Johann II. in Heidelberg empfangen. Der fast zeitgleich eintreffende Wolfgang Wilhelm wurde aber nicht nach Heidelberg eingelassen. Das Resultat war ein heftiger Streit zwischen den verschiedenen Häusern. Da sich Kaiser Matthias nicht in den Streit einmischte und sogar 1613 dem immer noch minderjährigen Friedrich das Lehen erteilte, war 1614 mit der Volljährigkeit des Kurprinzen die Angelegenheit eigentlich erledigt. Dieser Streit sollte sich aber auf die weitere Zukunft der Kurpfalz noch gravierend auswirken, da die Münchner Linie der Wittelsbacher erneut ihre Ansprüche auf die Pfälzer Kurwürde anmeldete., Heirat mit Elisabeth Stuart., Die Heiratspolitik des kurpfälzischen Fürstenhauses war darauf ausgerichtet, die Stellung des Landes im reformierten Lager zu stärken: Zwei Schwestern Friedrichs waren bereits mit protestantischen Fürsten des Reiches verheiratet, und auch die 1595 geborene Katharina Sophie sollte mit Gustav Adolf von Schweden vermählt werden. Für Friedrich bot sich eine Heirat mit Elisabeth Stuart, der einzigen Tochter des englischen, schottischen und irischen Königs Jakob I. und somit einer der zu jener Zeit höchstgestellten Bräute Europas, an. Auch wenn der dortige Hof schon einige Bewerber als nicht standesgemäß abgelehnt hatte und die Kurpfalz weder über die territoriale Ausdehnung noch die politische Macht einer großen europäischen Monarchie verfügte, versuchte man, die Gelegenheit zu nutzen, zumal König Jakob zu dieser Zeit bereits Pläne seiner Berater verworfen hatte, Elisabeth mit dem katholischen französischen König Ludwig XIII. zu verheiraten, da dies zu einer Störung des konfessionspolitischen Gleichgewichts in Europa hätte führen können., Zu diesem Zweck reiste der Hofmeister des Kurprinzen Hans Meinhard von Schönberg im Frühjahr 1612 nach London und versuchte dort die Vorbehalte auszuräumen, indem er die \\"königsgleichen\\" Rechte des Kurfürsten und dessen Stellung als Führer der protestantischen Kräfte im Reich hervorhob. Auch von den Niederlanden und Sedan aus wurde von Verwandten das Projekt vorangetrieben, so dass man sich am 26. Mai 1612 über den Heiratsvertrag einig war. Die Prinzessin brachte eine Mitgift von 40.000 Pfund mit, und Friedrich musste ein jährliches Wittum von 10.000 Pfund garantieren., Obwohl Königin Anna mit der geplanten Verbindung unzufrieden war, reiste Friedrich nach London und landete am 16. Oktober 1612 auf englischem Boden. Dort traf er erstmals mit Elisabeth zusammen und machte durch sein gutes Aussehen und freundliches Benehmen einen sehr günstigen Eindruck auf den Hof und seine künftige Braut. Zuvor hatte bereits ein reger Briefwechsel in französischer Sprache zwischen den beiden stattgefunden. Die Verlobung fand am 7. Januar 1613 statt; Königin Anna blieb ihr aufgrund ihrer Vorbehalte allerdings fern. Am 24. Februar 1613 wurde in der königlichen Kapelle am Whitehall-Palast Hochzeit gefeiert. Bei der Zeremonie trug Friedrich die Kette des Hosenbandordens, der ihm kurz zuvor verliehen worden war und den er später in sein Wappen aufnahm. Die Festlichkeiten nach der Trauung werden als außergewöhnlich beschrieben. Ein Festspiel von Francis Beaumont wurde aufgeführt, worin religiöses Verhalten und Rittertum in Verbindung gebracht wurden. Die gesamten Festlichkeiten wurden von Francis Bacon ausgerichtet., Mit einer Zwischenstation in Den Haag, wo beide den Statthalter der Niederlande Moritz von Oranien, den Onkel des Kurfürsten, trafen, reiste das junge Paar am 5. Mai 1613 nach Deutschland. Am 13. Juni wurde beiden in Heidelberg ein großartiger Empfang durch die Stadtbevölkerung zuteil. Die anschließenden Feierlichkeiten zogen sich mehrere Tage hin. Bereits seit 1612 hatte Friedrich mit Blick auf die Heirat im Heidelberger Schloss umfangreiche Baumaßnahmen durchführen lassen, um seiner Gattin eine standesgemäße Unterkunft zu bieten. So ließ er den sogenannten Englischen Bau als Palast für Elisabeth errichten. 1615 entstand zur Erinnerung an den triumphalen Einzug in Heidelberg das Elisabethentor, mit dem Friedrich für Elisabeth einen separaten Eingang in seine Residenz schuf., Elisabeth war von Anfang an bei ihren Untertanen sehr beliebt. Diese Beliebtheit nahm nach der Geburt ihres Sohnes Friedrich Heinrich am 1. Januar 1614 noch weiter zu. Dem Jungen schien als Kurprinz und möglichem englischen Thronfolger eine große Zukunft bevorzustehen. Elisabeth gebar ihrem Mann bis 1632 \\"dreizehn Kinder\\", von denen fünf ihre Mutter überlebten., Kurfürst vor dem Dreißigjährigen Krieg., Der Bau des Elisabethentors war nur der Auftakt für eine größere Umgestaltung der Residenz. So wurde ein neuer Hofgarten, der berühmte Hortus Palatinus, angelegt und mit zahlreichen Grotten und Brunnen versehen, die Friedrich verherrlichten und ihn als Gott Apollo und Herkules darstellten., Friedrich selbst sah sich als Führer der protestantischen Fürsten im Reich und als Verteidiger der \\"teutschen Libertät\\" gegen den katholischen Kaiser. Das Reich selbst stand kurz vor einer bewaffneten Auseinandersetzung; seit dem Ende des vorhergehenden Jahrhunderts hatten sich die Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den Fürsten der drei Konfessionen – wobei die calvinistische reichsrechtlich nicht anerkannt war – zu einem Kampf um die Verfassung des Reiches entwickelt. Weiterhin war ein Krieg zwischen den protestantischen Generalstaaten der Niederlande und dem habsburgischen Spanien absehbar, da 1621 ein Zwölfjähriger Waffenstillstand auslaufen sollte und beide Seiten bereits seit Jahren für den Krieg rüsteten., Die Kurpfalz bildete dabei eine wichtige Rolle als potentielles Durchmarschgebiet der kaiserlichen Truppen aus den habsburgischen Erblanden.

Als solcher widmete er sich der Um- und Neuorganisation der ihm unterstellten Truppenverbände. Im Oktober 1904 bestieg er den Thron. Das sächsische Wahlgesetz wurde 1909 unter seiner Mitwirkung grundlegend reformiert und erreichte eine breitere Repräsentation der Bevölkerung. Die von ihm angestrebte Neugestaltung des Schulwesens scheiterte dagegen im Jahr 1912. Im Ersten Weltkrieg übernahm Friedrich August als einziger der vier königlichen Bundesfürsten nicht den Oberbefehl über seine Armee, sondern beschränkte sich auf repräsentative und karitative Aufgaben. Parallel dazu strebte er vehement territoriale Erweiterungen für sein Königreich an., Im Zuge der Novemberrevolution dankte er am 13. November 1918 ab und zog sich auf seinen schlesischen Privatbesitz Schloss Sibyllenort zurück. Von dort aus führte er einen Rechtsstreit mit dem Freistaat Sachsen um die Abfindung des ehemaligen Königshauses, der im Jahr 1924 mit einem Kompromiss, dem Auseinandersetzungsvertrag, endete. Politisch und räumlich ins Abseits gedrängt, spielte Friedrich August während der Weimarer Republik keine gewichtige Rolle mehr. Als Privatmann widmete er sich vornehmlich der Jagd und ging vermehrt auf Reisen. Sein Tod im Februar 1932 kam für die Öffentlichkeit überraschend. Zu den Trauerfeierlichkeiten in Dresden erwiesen ihm mehr als eine halbe Million Menschen die letzte Ehre., Prinzenjahre., Elternhaus., Friedrich August wurde am 25.Mai 1865 gegen 22Uhr als erster Sohn und viertes Kind des späteren Königs Georg von Sachsen und dessen Gemahlin Infantin Maria Anna von Portugal im Palais der Sekundogenitur auf der Langgasse geboren. Seine Geschwister waren die vor ihm verstorbenen Prinzessinnen Marie Johanna (1860–1861) und Elisabeth Albertine (1862–1863), seine ältere Schwester Mathilde sowie die nach ihm geborenen Maria Josepha, Johann Georg, Maximilian und Albert. Am Tag nach der Geburt taufte Bischof Ludwig Forwerk das Kind. Taufzeugen waren unter anderen Elisabeth Ludovika von Bayern als Großtante, Gustav von Wasa als Großonkel, Sophie von Bayern als Tante sowie Carl Theodor von Bayern als Onkel. Am Sonntag, dem 28.Mai 1865, fanden überall im Königreich Feierlichkeiten zu Ehren des neugeborenen Prinzen statt, besonders festlich im Dresdner Residenzschloss und in der Katholischen Hofkirche, wo das Geburtsfest abgehalten wurde. Beschlossen wurden die Festivitäten mit einer Galatafel. Noch am Abend wurde auf Geheiß König Johanns vor dem Hauptbahnhof die erste Litfaßsäule Dresdens errichtet, deren Plakatierung dem neuen Thronerben galt., Kindheit., Die frühe Kindheit war von elterlicher Liebe und häuslicher Geborgenheit geprägt. Während sich der Vater durch militärische und repräsentative Verpflichtungen nur eingeschränkt um seinen Sohn kümmern konnte, umsorgte die Mutter ihre Kinder sehr. Die Erziehung oblag höfischen Angestellten. Friedrich Augusts Leben wurde bereits im Säuglingsalter auf eine spätere Militärlaufbahn hingelenkt. So ernannte ihn sein Großvater König Johann anlässlich seines ersten Geburtstags zum Chef der Infanteriebrigade „Prinz Maximilian“, die im Folgejahr zu dem nach ihm benannten 5. Infanterie-Regiment „Prinz Friedrich August“ umgegliedert wurde. Zugleich verlieh er ihm den Hausorden der Rautenkrone. Einen Monat später, im Juni 1866, marschierten preußische Truppen in Sachsen ein, das im Deutschen Krieg an der Seite Österreichs kämpfte. Die Königsfamilie flüchtete mit Friedrich August nach Aussig und weiter nach Prag. Nach der verlorenen Schlacht bei Königgrätz führte ihr Weg in das Königreich Bayern, wo Luitpold von Bayern der Familie seine Regensburger Villa überließ. Nach dem Friedensschluss im Oktober 1866 kehrte die Familie nach Dresden zurück. Prägend für den jungen Friedrich August war der umjubelte Einzug der sächsischen Truppen vom Deutsch-Französischen Krieg am 11.Juli 1871 auf dem Dresdner Neumarkt; er soll damals Otto von Bismarck bewundert haben. Hatte die Erziehung bis dahin in weiblichen Händen gelegen, wurde ihm 1872 ein Offizier zur Seite gestellt. Zudem erhielt Friedrich August privaten Elementarunterricht; er soll Interesse an Geografie sowie ein gutes Zahlengedächtnis gezeigt und mit Vorliebe Gedichte auswendig gelernt haben. Klavierunterricht mochte er nicht. Charakterlich wurden ihm kindliche Heiterkeit und Nachgiebigkeit bescheinigt. Der Unterricht fand überwiegend im Dresdner Zinzendorfpalais oder in der Sommerresidenz seiner Eltern in Hosterwitz bei Pillnitz statt. Von der dortigen königlichen Villa unternahm er oft Wanderungen in die nahen Wälder und Weinberge, was ihn mit Natur und Heimat tief verband., Jugend- und Studienzeit., Ab 1874 besuchte Friedrich August das Königliche Gymnasium Dresden-Neustadt, wo ihn unter anderem der Physiker August Toepler unterrichtete. Er erlernte Mathematik, Deutsch, Erdkunde sowie Geschichte. Französisch, Latein und Griechisch sprach er fließend. Religion lehrten der spätere Bischof von Straßburg Adolf Fritzen sowie der künftige Apostolische Präfekt von Meißen Ludwig Wahl., An seinem zwölften Geburtstag trat Friedrich August unter Ernennung zum Unterleutnant der sächsischen Armee bei. Zeitlebens zeigte er eine starke Neigung zum Militär. Den Dienst verrichtete er neben den schulischen Pflichten. Er wurde der 7.Kompanie im 1. (Leib-)Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 100 mit Standort in der Albertstadt zugeteilt. Mit diesem Regiment nahm der Prinz im Juni 1878 an der Parade anlässlich der Silberhochzeit des Königspaares Albert und Carola auf dem Alaunplatz sowie am 15.September 1882 an der Kaiserparade in Mergendorf bei Riesa teil, wo ihn Wilhelm I. mit dem Schwarzen Adlerorden auszeichnete. Nach Bestehen seines Abiturexamens im Frühjahr 1883 leistete Friedrich August im Juni den Fahneneid, trat den regulären Armeedienst in seinem Stammregiment an und wurde am 19.September 1883 zum Premierleutnant befördert. Zugleich erhielt er mit Hauptmann Georg Freiherr von Wagner (1852–1905) einen persönlichen Adjutanten. Erschüttert wurde Friedrich August im Februar 1884 vom frühen Tod seiner Mutter, die typhösem Fieber erlag., Im Mai 1884 nahm er an der Straßburger Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität ein Studium auf. Er besuchte dort zwei Semester lang Vorlesungen in Rechts- und Staatswissenschaften sowie Geschichte. Die Freizeit nutzte er für Reitausflüge und Besuche bei dem in Straßburg stationierten 6. Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 105 sowie dem 1. Fußartillerie-Regiment Nr. 12 in der Festung Metz. Von April 1885 bis Ostern 1886 setzte er die Studien an der Landesuniversität Leipzig fort, um einen sächsischen Studienabschluss zu erlangen. Quartier bezog er im Königlichen Palais. Zu seinen Dozenten zählten Bernhard Windscheid, Anton Springer, Adolf Wach und Karl Binding. Am 11.März 1886 erhielt Friedrich August sein Abgangsdokument und beendete die Studien., Fortan bereitete sich Friedrich August auf seine künftige Rolle als König vor. Um Einblick in die sächsische Verwaltungstätigkeit zu gewinnen, arbeitete der Prinz zeitweilig in der Amtshauptmannschaft Dresden-Altstadt, später in der Kreishauptmannschaft Dresden. Sein volkswirtschaftliches Wissen vertiefte er durch Besichtigungen von Industriestätten und Handwerksbetrieben. Daneben nahm er an Sitzungen des Gesamtministeriums, eine Art Vorläufer der heutigen Staatskanzlei, der Ersten Kammer sowie des Berliner Reichstags teil und besuchte öffentliche Gerichtsverhandlungen, um die praktische Rechtspflege besser zu verstehen. Danach bereiste der Prinz von Juni bis September 1886 die Länder Mitteleuropas. Wichtigste Stationen waren der Hof Kaiser Franz Josephs in Wien sowie die Städte Salzburg, Graz, Budapest und Belgrad, wo ihn König Milan I. empfing. Anschließend führte der Weg über Breslau nach Berlin und weiter nach Hamburg. Von dort gelangte Friedrich August per Schiff nach London, wo er am 8.Juli eintraf und Königin Victoria sowie den damaligen Fürsten von Wales und späteren König Eduard VII. besuchte. Im August reiste er nach Schottland weiter. Von Leith führte der Seeweg schließlich zurück nach Hamburg. In Norddeutschland schlossen Besichtigungen der Hafenstädte Bremen, Lübeck, Wilhelmshaven und Kiel die Reise ab., Offizierslaufbahn., Nach seiner Rückkehr nahm Friedrich August wieder seinen Militärdienst auf. Mit Wirkung zum 9.September 1886 wurde er als Kavallerist zum 1. Husaren-Regiment Nr. 18 nach Großenhain kommandiert. Im Winter 1886/87 zog er sich eine Gelenkentzündung zu, die eine Kur notwendig machte. Im Frühjahr 1887 überbrachte er zum 90.Geburtstag Kaiser WilhelmsI. in Berlin die Glückwünsche seines Königshauses. Mit seiner Beförderung zum Rittmeister am 16.September 1887 erfolgte die Rückversetzung als Hauptmann zum Stammregiment. Die dortige Stellung als Kompaniechef bekleidete Friedrich August etwas über ein Jahr; 1889 wurde er im Zuge erneuter Dienstrotation zur Artillerie kommandiert. Dort befehligte er im 1. Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 12 in Königsbrück eine Feldbatterie. Nach der Beförderung zum Major am 23.Juli 1888 erfolgte die abermalige Rückversetzung zum Stammregiment, wo Friedrich August die Charge als Bataillonskommandeur übernahm. Nach einem Intermezzo als Schwadronenchef im Garde-Reiter-Regiment brach er zu einer mehrmonatigen Kavalierstour mit Ziel Jerusalem auf. Bei erneuter Dienstaufnahme im August 1890 wurde Friedrich August Bataillonsführer im Schützen-(Füsilier-)Regiment „Prinz Georg“ Nr. 108., Privat entwickelte sich Friedrich Augusts Leben standesgemäß. Im November 1891 ehelichte er mit Luise von Österreich-Toskana eine Tochter des Großherzogs der Toskana Ferdinands IV. Dem Paar waren sieben Kinder beschieden. Die Ehe sollte 1902 im Skandal enden. Zwischenzeitlich setzte sich Friedrich Augusts steile Militärkarriere fort. Am 18.Dezember 1891 erfolgte seine Beförderung zum Oberstleutnant und am 22.September 1892 die zum Oberst mit zeitgleicher Ernennung zum Kommandeur des Schützen-(Füsilier-)Regiments „Prinz Georg“ Nr. 108. Mit den Avancements in der sächsischen Armee gingen entsprechende österreichische und preußische einher. So wurde Friedrich August 1891 am 19.November zum Major und am 18.Dezember zum Oberst der k.u.k. Österreichischen Armee ernannt.

Januar 1330 in Gutenstein) aus dem Adelsgeschlecht der Habsburger war ab 1314 römisch-deutscher König., Nach dem Tod Kaiser Heinrichs VII. 1313 wurden im folgenden Jahr im römisch-deutschen Reich mit dem Wittelsbacher Ludwig dem Bayern und dem Habsburger Friedrich zwei Könige gewählt und gekrönt, da das Votum der Kurfürsten gespalten war. Jahrzehnte vor den eindeutigen Regeln der Goldenen Bulle wurde über die Rechtmäßigkeit der römischen Königswahl erbittert gestritten. Bewaffnete Auseinandersetzungen führten in der Schlacht bei Mühldorf 1322 zu einer Vorentscheidung für die wittelsbachische Seite. Friedrich wurde für drei Jahre inhaftiert. Konflikte mit der Kurie und mit Friedrichs Brüdern zwangen Ludwig zu einem Ausgleich. Der Münchner Vertrag vom September 1325 zwischen Ludwig und Friedrich begründete mit einer gleichberechtigten Doppelherrschaft ein in der mittelalterlichen Reichsgeschichte singuläres Verfassungskonstrukt. Friedrich spielte jedoch im Reich fortan nur noch eine Nebenrolle, während Ludwig die Kaiserkrone errang., Nunmehr trat Friedrich besonders auf dem Gebiet der Stiftungen hervor, die er als Mittel der Herrschaftslegitimierung und -stabilisierung einsetzte. Unter ihm verlagerte sich der Schwerpunkt von den habsburgischen Stammlanden im Westen in die neuen Herzogtümer im Osten. Zugleich ebnete er den Weg für Wien als habsburgische Residenz. Den Beinamen „der Schöne“ erhielt Friedrich erst im 16. Jahrhundert. Die freiwillige Rückkehr des Habsburgers in die Gefangenschaft Ludwigs des Bayern wurde im 19. Jahrhundert vielfach künstlerisch verarbeitet., Leben., Herkunft und frühe Jahre., Friedrich gehörte der Familie der Habsburger an. Das adlige Geschlecht lässt sich auf einen um die Mitte des 10. Jahrhunderts lebenden Guntram zurückverfolgen. Zu den Enkeln Guntrams gehörten Radbot und Bischof Werner von Straßburg. Einer von beiden soll um 1020/30 die Habichtsburg/Habsburg errichtet haben. Der habsburgische Besitz basierte auf Allod zwischen Reuss und Aare mit der namengebenden Burg und Klostervogteien in der Nordschweiz, im Schwarzwald und im Elsass. Durch das Aussterben der Zähringer 1218 stiegen die Habsburger zur führenden Familie zwischen Oberrhein und Alpen auf., Friedrich war einer der Enkel Rudolfs von Habsburg, des ersten römisch-deutschen Königs aus dem Haus Habsburg. Im Jahr 1282 belehnte Rudolf seine Söhne Albrecht I. und Rudolf II. mit den Ländern Österreich, der Steiermark, Krain und der Windischen Mark. Die dem Reich heimgefallenen Lehen konnte Rudolf als König an seine Familienangehörigen vergeben. Sieben Jahre später wurde Friedrich als zweiter Sohn des Herzogs und späteren Königs Albrecht I. und der Elisabeth geboren. Aus der Ehe gingen insgesamt 21 Kinder hervor. Friedrichs Mutter stammte von den Grafen von Tirol-Görz ab. Ihm wurde als erstem Habsburger der für die Babenberger typische Name Friedrich verliehen. Mit diesem Leitnamen wurde Friedrich in die Tradition der Babenberger Herzöge gestellt. Damit sollte die beginnende Integration der Dynastie in den östlichen Herzogtümern, mit welchen die Habsburger 1282 belehnt worden waren, gefördert werden. Friedrich, sein älterer Bruder Rudolf und der jüngere Bruder Leopold wurden am 21. November 1298 in Nürnberg von Albrecht zu gesamter Hand mit Österreich, Steiermark, Krain, der Windischen Mark und Portenau belehnt. Gerald Schwedler konnte zeigen, dass sich die Habsburger über Jahrzehnte vor allem am Rechtsprinzip der Gesamthandbelehnung orientierten. Das Modell einer Mehrfachsicherung sollte Konflikte zwischen den habsburgischen Söhnen und das Aussterben der Familie in männlicher Linie verhindern., Nach einer Quelle aus dem Augustinerchorherrenstift Dießen vom Jahr 1365 haben Friedrich und sein späterer Rivale Ludwig einen Teil ihrer Kindheit zusammen in Wien am Hof Herzog Albrechts I. von Österreich verbracht. Sie waren Vettern, denn Ludwigs Mutter Mechthild war eine Enkelin Rudolfs I. von Habsburg und Friedrichs Mutter Elisabeth eine Enkelin des Wittelsbachers Otto II. In Wien sollen Friedrich und Ludwig die \\"litterae\\" gelernt haben, also in Latein unterrichtet worden sein. Allerdings gibt es für Lateinkenntnisse Ludwigs und Friedrichs keine sonstigen Belege., Am 17. Januar 1303 trat Friedrich erstmals aktiv hervor, indem er das schwäbische Kloster Zwiefalten privilegierte. Daraus lässt sich schließen, dass er von seinem Vater Regierungsbefugnisse für die westlichen Territorien erhalten hatte. Er regierte jedoch nicht selbständig, da er sich in den folgenden Jahren meist in der Umgebung seines Vaters aufhielt. Friedrichs älterer Bruder Rudolf wurde im Oktober 1306 zum König von Böhmen erhoben, verstarb jedoch bereits 1307. Im Jahr 1306 übernahm Friedrich von seinem älteren Bruder die Herrschaft in den Herzogtümern Österreich und Steiermark. Zu seinen Aufgaben gehörten neben der Bestätigung von Privilegien Rechtsgeschäfte wie die Verleihung des Grazer Stadtrechts an Voitsberg. Friedrichs Vater, König Albrecht, fiel am 1. Mai 1308 einem Mordanschlag seines Neffen Johann Parricida zum Opfer. Johann hatte Albrecht am selben Tag zum wiederholten Mal vergeblich darum gebeten, seine Erbansprüche anzuerkennen und ihm einen eigenen Herrschaftsbereich zuzuweisen., Nach dem Tod des Vaters war Friedrich der älteste der überlebenden Söhne. Zu den Aufgaben, die sich den Erben stellten, gehörten die Durchsetzung der habsburgischen Ansprüche auf die böhmische Königskrone, eine mögliche Kandidatur des ältesten Sohnes bei der anstehenden Wahl des römisch-deutschen Königs und die Verfolgung der Mörder ihres Vaters. Friedrich erhob Anspruch auf die Königsnachfolge seines Vaters, doch die Kurfürsten einigten sich auf den luxemburgischen Grafen Heinrich. Leopold übernahm die Verfolgung der Königsmörder, während Friedrich sich auf den Kampf um das böhmische Erbe im Osten konzentrierte. In Mähren rückte Friedrich mit einem Heer ein, doch in Böhmen brach die habsburgische Herrschaft bald zusammen. Die Stände wählten den Meinhardiner Herzog Heinrich von Kärnten zum König. Friedrich stieß zwar bis Prag vor, konnte jedoch mit seinem Heer keinen Umschwung bewirken. Daher verzichtete er im Znaimer Vertrag vom 14. August 1308 auf das Königreich Böhmen und erhielt dafür von Heinrich von Kärnten 45.000 Mark Pfennige., Zum Zweck einer Verständigung mit dem neuen König reiste Friedrich im Sommer 1309 zum Hoftag nach Speyer. Die Verhandlungen waren ausgesprochen schwierig, wozu vor allem Friedrichs prunkhaftes Auftreten mit großem Gefolge beigetragen haben dürfte. Als Friedrich schon abreisen wollte, kam doch noch am 17. September 1309 eine Einigung zustande. Friedrich verzichtete auf die böhmische Krone und sagte dem König für die Gewinnung Böhmens Unterstützung durch Heeresfolge und ein Darlehen zu. Außerdem versprach er Heinrich Heeresfolge gegen Friedrich den Freidigen und für den geplanten Romzug. Im Gegenzug erteilte Heinrich Friedrich und dessen Brüdern die Gesamtbelehnung für alle ihre Besitzungen. Johann und seine Gesinnungsgenossen Rudolf von Balm, Rudolf von Wart und Walter von Eschenbach wurden als die Mörder König Albrechts vom König als Majestätsverbrecher geächtet. Ihr Nachlass wurde den Habsburgern zugesprochen. Heinrich stimmte auch der Überführung der Gebeine Albrechts I. aus dem Zisterzienserkloster Wettingen in die Königsgrablege des Speyerer Doms zu., Ein Jahr später erkrankte Friedrich so schwer, dass er von Vielen schon für tot gehalten wurde, so dass man ihn herumführte, um zu beweisen, dass er noch lebte., Streit um Niederbayern ab 1313., Friedrich und Ludwig versuchten rivalisierend ihren Einfluss in Niederbayern auszubauen. Ludwig war seit 1312 Vormund der minderjährigen Herzöge Heinrich XIV., Heinrich XV. und Otto IV. Die niederbayerischen Herzogswitwen Agnes und Judith wollten hingegen die Vormundschaft über die Söhne an die Habsburger übertragen. Bei Verhandlungen im Kloster Aldersbach und in Landau konnten die beiden Gegner keine Lösung erzielen. Aus der sogenannten Schlacht von Gammelsdorf westlich von Landshut im November 1313 ging Ludwig als Sieger hervor. Die Einschätzung der Ereignisse in der Geschichtswissenschaft schwankt zwischen „entscheidender Schlacht“ und bloßem „Scharmützel“., Ein Vertrag, den Friedrich und Ludwig am 17. April 1314 in Salzburg schlossen, beendete die Auseinandersetzungen. Sie schliefen gemeinsam in einem Bett und verdeutlichten damit nach dem Bericht Johanns von Viktring die „vollständige Einigung und Ausräumung aller offenen Streitigkeiten“. Dieses Ritual war weit verbreitet und ist vielfach bezeugt. Friedrich, der an der verlorenen Schlacht nicht teilgenommen hatte, wurde durch die Niederlage aus Niederbayern verdrängt. Dort konnte sich Ludwig nun den Zugriff auf die Herrschaft sichern. Zugleich festigte er seine Stellung im Südosten des Reiches. Für Bernhard Lübbers stellte Ludwigs Sieg über Friedrich einen „Meilenstein“ auf dem Weg zum römisch-deutschen Thron dar., Vermählung mit Isabella von Aragón im Jahr 1313., Als Herzog von Österreich und der Steiermark nahm Friedrich wohl erstmals 1311 Kontakt zur Krone Aragón auf. Mit dem aragonesischen König Jayme II./Jakob II. verhandelte er über eine Ehe mit dessen dritter Tochter Isabella von Aragón, denn er konnte im Reich keine passende Gemahlin finden. Die Habsburger waren bereits mit allen großen Fürstengeschlechtern verwandt. Das aragonesische Heiratsprojekt war zu dieser Zeit weniger auf das römisch-deutsche Königtum ausgerichtet als auf einen Prestigegewinn in einer rangbewussten Gesellschaft; es sollte die politische Vernetzung über die Grenzen des Reichs hinaus steigern. Dies wiederum gab vielfältigen Handlungsspielraum zur Konsolidierung und zum Ausbau der habsburgischen Machtstellung. Am 14. Oktober 1313 wurden Isabella und Friedrich im königlichen Schloss in Barcelona vom Erzbischof von Tarragona vermählt. Die Hochzeitsfeier fand am 31. Januar 1314 in Judenburg statt. Aus der Ehe gingen drei Kinder hervor: der 1316 geborene Friedrich II., der bereits wenige Tage nach seiner Geburt verstarb, und die Töchter Elisabeth (1317–1336) und Anna (1318–1342). Isabella trat durchaus eigenständig auf, was etwa die Führung eines eigenen Siegels zeigt. Anhand der urkundlichen Überlieferung und der Briefe kam Stefanie Dick zum Fazit, dass Isabella und Friedrich als Paar agierten, besonders im Zusammenhang politischer Beziehungsgeflechte., Thronstreit (1314–1325)., Ausbruch des Konflikts., Im August 1313 war Kaiser Heinrich VII. während seines Italienzuges an einem schweren Malariaanfall verstorben.

Was this policy good for Canada? Explain.","output":"The information about General Motors' buying policy in 1953 is not provided in the given prompt. Therefore, its specific details and the evaluation of its impact on Canada cannot be determined. However, in general, a buying policy refers to a company's guidelines or approach to purchasing goods and services. It typically includes considerations such as sourcing, pricing, quality, and supplier relationships. Without information on GM's specific buying policy in 1953, it is not possible to determine its implications for Canada. To evaluate whether the policy was good for Canada or not, one would need more information on the specifics of the policy and its effects on various stakeholders such as suppliers, employees, and the overall economy. Factors such as promoting local procurement, fair pricing, supporting domestic suppliers, and generating employment opportunities could contribute to a positive impact on Canada. Conversely, if the policy led to negative outcomes like the exclusion of local suppliers, unfair pricing practices, or adverse effects on the economy, it may not have been considered good for Canada.

The quote suggests that what is advantageous or beneficial for General Motors as a corporation is also beneficial for the overall well-being and prosperity of the country. However, it is essential to note that this quote has been subject to various interpretations and debates. Supporters argue that a thriving and successful GM would lead to increased economic growth, job creation, and technological advancements that would benefit the country as a whole. They believe that when a major company like GM thrives, it can have positive effects on related industries, supply chains, and the overall economy. Critics, on the other hand, argue that this quote reflects a narrow focus on the interests and profitability of a single corporation, which may not necessarily align with broader societal interests. They argue that it is crucial to consider the impacts on workers' rights, local communities, the environment, and the overall welfare and equality of society.

They believe that when a major corporation like GM thrives, it can have a ripple effect, stimulating related industries and creating a multiplier effect that contributes to economic growth. Critics, however, view this statement with skepticism. They argue that focusing solely on GM's success ignores potential negative externalities such as environmental impacts, labor practices, and socioeconomic disparities. Critics contend that the well-being of the country should not solely depend on the success of one corporation and that a more holistic approach is needed to consider the broader welfare of society, including workers' rights, community well-being, and sustainability.

Has this practice changed? If so, why has it changed?","output":"In 1953, it was more common for Canadians to dress up when going to the supermarket or any public place. However, over the years, this practice has substantially changed. Today, it is generally not the norm for individuals to dress up in formal or semi-formal attire when going to the supermarket. The change in this practice can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, there has been a significant shift in societal norms and attitudes towards dressing. Casual wear has become more widely accepted in many aspects of daily life, including grocery shopping. People today tend to prioritize comfort and convenience over formal dressing, especially for routine activities like running errands. Additionally, the increased pace of modern life and changing lifestyles have contributed to a shift towards more casual dressing. With busier schedules and a focus on efficiency, people may prioritize convenience and practicality over dressing up for everyday activities. This change has been facilitated by advancements in technology, which have made shopping more convenient and accessible through the rise of online shopping and delivery services. Moreover, the influence of popular culture, fashion trends, and the media has played a role in altering societal expectations of dressing. As fashion has become more casual and relaxed, this has permeated into everyday life, including grocery shopping. Overall, the change in the practice of dressing up when going to the supermarket reflects broader shifts in societal norms, lifestyles, and cultural influences that have embraced casual attire and prioritized convenience and comfort in daily activities."},{"instruction":"write it into 2 sentences","output":"In 1953, it was common for Canadians to dress up when going to the supermarket, but over the years, this practice has significantly changed.

Mai 1911 in Zürich; † 4. April 1991 ebenda) war ein Schweizer Schriftsteller und Architekt. Mit Theaterstücken wie \\"Biedermann und die Brandstifter\\" oder \\"Andorra\\" sowie mit seinen drei großen Romanen \\"Stiller\\", \\"Homo faber\\" und \\"Mein Name sei Gantenbein\\" erreichte Frisch ein breites Publikum und fand Eingang in den Schulkanon. Darüber hinaus veröffentlichte er Hörspiele, Erzählungen und kleinere Prosatexte sowie zwei literarische Tagebücher über die Zeiträume 1946 bis 1949 und 1966 bis 1971., Der junge Max Frisch empfand bürgerliche und künstlerische Existenz als unvereinbar und war lange Zeit unsicher, welchen Lebensentwurf er wählen sollte. Infolgedessen absolvierte er nach einem abgebrochenen Germanistik-Studium und ersten literarischen Arbeiten ein Studium der Architektur und arbeitete einige Jahre lang als Architekt. Nach dem Erfolg seines Romans \\"Stiller\\" entschied er sich für ein Dasein als Schriftsteller und verließ seine Familie, um sich ganz dem Schreiben widmen zu können. Frisch war zweimal verheiratet – mit Gertrud von Meyenburg (1942–1959) und Marianne Oellers (1968–1979) – und hatte unter anderem eine Beziehung mit Ingeborg Bachmann (1958–1963)., Im Zentrum von Frischs Schaffen steht häufig die Auseinandersetzung mit sich selbst, wobei viele der dabei aufgeworfenen Probleme als typisch für den postmodernen Menschen gelten: Finden und Behaupten einer eigenen Identität, insbesondere in der Begegnung mit den festgefügten Bildern anderer, Konstruktion der eigenen Biografie, Geschlechterrollen und ihre Auflösung sowie die Frage, was mit Sprache überhaupt sagbar sei. Im literarisch ausgestalteten Tagebuch, das Autobiografisches mit fiktionalen Elementen verbindet, findet Frisch eine literarische Form, die ihm in besonderem Maße entspricht und in der er auch seine ausgedehnten Reisen reflektiert. Nachdem er jahrelang im Ausland gelebt hatte, beschäftigte Frisch sich nach seiner Rückkehr zudem zunehmend kritisch mit seinem Heimatland, der Schweiz., Leben., Elternhaus und Schulzeit., Max Frisch wurde am 15. Mai 1911 in Zürich als zweiter Sohn des Architekten Franz Bruno Frisch und dessen Frau Karolina Bettina Frisch (geb. Wildermuth) geboren. Er hatte eine Halbschwester aus der ersten Ehe des Vaters, Emma Elisabeth (1899–1972), und einen acht Jahre älteren Bruder (1903–1978), der nach dem Vater Franz hieß. Die Familie lebte in einfachen Verhältnissen, und die finanzielle Lage verschärfte sich, als der Vater während des Ersten Weltkriegs seine Anstellung verlor. Frisch hatte kaum eine emotionale Beziehung zum Vater, stand seiner Mutter dagegen sehr nah., Während seiner Zeit als Gymnasiast (1924–1930) am Züricher Realgymnasium schrieb Frisch erste Stücke, die er erfolglos zur Aufführung zu bringen versuchte und später vernichtete. Am Gymnasium lernte er darüber hinaus Werner Coninx kennen, dessen Kenntnisse über Literatur und Philosophie Frisch im Laufe ihrer langjährigen Freundschaft zahlreiche Impulse gaben., Germanistikstudium und Arbeit als Journalist., Dem Wunsch seiner Eltern gemäß, die ihren Kindern ein Studium nach freier Wahl ermöglichen wollten, begann Frisch im Wintersemester 1930/31 ein Germanistik-Studium an der Universität Zürich. Auf der einen Seite traf er hier auf Professoren, die ihn beeindruckten und ihm Kontakte zu Verlagen und Zeitungen vermitteln konnten, darunter Robert Faesi, Schriftsteller und Professor für neuere und schweizerische Literatur, und den Romanisten Theophil Spoerri. Auf der anderen Seite stellte er fest, dass der akademische Lehrplan ihm nicht das solide schriftstellerische Handwerkszeug vermitteln konnte, das er sich von dem Studium erhofft hatte. Im Nebenfach belegte Frisch Forensische Psychologie, von der er sich tiefere Einsichten in den Kern menschlicher Existenz versprach., Frischs erster Beitrag in der \\"Neuen Zürcher Zeitung\\" (NZZ) stammt aus dem Mai 1931. Als im März 1932 sein Vater starb, konzentrierte er sich zunehmend auf die journalistische Arbeit, um sich und seiner Mutter ein Auskommen zu sichern. Dieser Schritt ist Thema des im April 1932 entstandenen Essays \\"Was bin ich?\\", der als eigentlicher Auftakt seiner freiberuflichen Tätigkeit gilt und bereits ein Grundproblem des gesamten späteren Werks zu erkennen gibt. In den folgenden drei Jahren entstanden über 100 journalistische und literarische Arbeiten, die sich weitgehend auf autobiografische Selbsterforschung und die Verarbeitung privater Erlebnisse konzentrieren, etwa der Trennung von der 18-jährigen Schauspielerin Else Schebesta, in die Frisch sich verliebt hatte. Nur wenige dieser Texte wurden später in die Werkausgabe aufgenommen. Schon während ihrer Entstehung hatte der Autor selbst bisweilen den Eindruck, dass die Selbstreflexion überhandnehme, und versuchte sich durch körperliche Arbeit abzulenken, etwa bei einer studentischen Arbeitskolonie im Straßenbau 1932., Von Februar bis Oktober 1933 erfüllte Frisch sich den Wunsch einer ausgedehnten Auslandsreise, die er durch während der Reise verfasste Feuilletonbeiträge finanzierte. So berichtete er unter anderem für die \\"NZZ\\" von der Eishockey-Weltmeisterschaft in Prag. Weitere Stationen waren Budapest, Belgrad, Sarajevo, Dubrovnik, Zagreb, Istanbul, Athen, Bari und Rom. Aus den Erlebnissen dieser Reise entstand Frischs erster Roman \\"Jürg Reinhart\\", der 1934 erschien. Die Romanfigur Jürg Reinhart ist hierin ein Alter Ego Frischs, der im Zuge einer Balkan-Reise versucht, seine Position im Leben zu bestimmen. Hierbei kommt er zu dem Schluss, sich nur durch eine „männliche Tat“ seiner Reife vergewissern zu können, und vollzieht diese, indem er der todkranken Tochter seiner Pensionswirtin aktive Sterbehilfe gewährt. Frisch griff damit das zu jener Zeit weltweit diskutierte Konzept der „Euthanasie“ auf, ohne die ethischen und politischen Konsequenzen, die sich wenige Jahre später durch die praktische Umsetzung der Nationalsozialisten ergaben, zu durchschauen., Neben seiner Arbeit für verschiedene Zeitungen belegte Frisch bis 1934 weiterhin Kurse an der Universität. Im Sommersemester 1934 lernte er die drei Jahre jüngere Käte Rubensohn kennen, mit der ihn in den folgenden Jahren eine Liebesbeziehung verband. Als deutsche Jüdin war Rubensohn aus Berlin emigriert, um weiter studieren zu können. Als Frisch 1935 zum ersten Mal ins Deutsche Reich reiste, bezog er in seinem \\"Kleinen Tagebuch einer deutschen Reise\\" kritisch Stellung gegenüber dem Antisemitismus, äußerte sich jedoch bewundernd über die „rassekundliche“ Ausstellung \\"Wunder des Lebens\\" von Herbert Bayer. Frisch konnte seine unpolitischen ersten Romane problemlos bei der Deutschen Verlags-Anstalt veröffentlichen, die der nationalsozialistischen Zensur unterlag. Erst im Laufe der 1940er Jahre begann Frisch, ein kritisches politisches Bewusstsein zu entwickeln. Diese zögerliche Entwicklung wird heute zum Teil mit dem konservativen Klima an der Universität Zürich erklärt, an der einzelne Professoren sogar Sympathien für Hitler und Mussolini pflegten. Dass Frisch solche Sympathien fremd waren, erklärte er später selbstkritisch mit seiner Liebe zu Käte Rubensohn., Hinwendung zur Architektur und Familiengründung., Im Gefühl, bei seinem Germanistikstudium keinen echten Beruf erlernt zu haben, suchte Frisch nach einer nicht literarischen, aber ebenfalls kreativen Alternative zum Journalismus. Mit einem Stipendium seines Freunds Werner Coninx ausgestattet, begann er 1936 ein Studium der Architektur an der ETH Zürich. Zu diesem Schritt hatte ihn auch Käte Rubensohn angeregt. Im gleichen Jahr zog sie ihre Zustimmung zu einer bereits beim Standesamt angemeldeten Heirat zurück, weil sie nicht aus Mitleid wegen ihrer unsicheren Situation als deutsche Jüdin in der Schweiz geheiratet werden wollte. Zuvor war es lange Frisch gewesen, der sich der Ehe widersetzt hatte, für die er sich nicht geschaffen glaubte. Im Herbst 1937 trennten sich beide, im Frühjahr des Folgejahres zog Rubensohn nach Basel., 1937 erschien Frischs zweiter Roman, \\"Antwort aus der Stille\\", über den er später vernichtend urteilte. Er greift das Thema der „männlichen Tat“ auf, bezieht nun aber ausdrücklich Stellung für einen bürgerlichen Lebensentwurf. Aus dieser Haltung zog Frisch auch privat Konsequenzen: Er ließ die Berufsbezeichnung „Schriftsteller“ aus seinem Pass löschen und verbrannte alle bisherigen Schriften. Frischs Vorsatz, das Schreiben aufzugeben, wurde 1938 durch den Gewinn des Conrad-Ferdinand-Meyer-Preises konterkariert, der mit 3000 Schweizer Franken dotiert war; sein Jahresstipendium betrug zu diesem Zeitpunkt 4000 Franken., Mit Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs 1939 wurde Frisch Kanonier der Schweizer Armee; er leistete bis 1945 insgesamt 650 Aktivdiensttage. Während dieser Zeit begann er wieder zu schreiben und veröffentlichte seine Notizen 1939 unter dem Titel \\"Aus dem Tagebuch eines Soldaten\\" in der Zeitschrift \\"Atlantis\\" (im Folgejahr auch als Buch unter dem Titel \\"Blätter aus dem Brotsack\\"). In ihm kommt eine weitgehend unkritische Haltung zum Soldatenleben und der Stellung der Schweiz im Zweiten Weltkrieg zum Ausdruck, die Frisch 1974 in seinem \\"Dienstbüchlein\\" aufarbeitete und auch revidierte., Nach Frischs Architekturdiplom im Sommer 1940 bot ihm sein Lehrer William Dunkel eine feste Stelle in seinem Architekturbüro an, so dass Frisch Ende 1940 die erste eigene Wohnung beziehen konnte. In Dunkels Atelier lernte er auch die Architektin Gertrud von Meyenburg kennen, die er am 30. Juli 1942 heiratete. Mit ihr hatte er zwei Töchter (Ursula, *1943, und Charlotte, *1949) sowie einen Sohn (Hans Peter, *1944). Seine Tochter Ursula, später Ursula Priess, hat in ihrem 2009 erschienenen Buch \\"Sturz durch alle Spiegel\\" ihr schwieriges Verhältnis zu ihrem Vater reflektiert., 1943 gewann Frisch unter 65 eingereichten Arbeiten den Architekturwettbewerb der Stadt Zürich für den Bau des Freibads Letzigraben (umgangssprachlich auch \\"Letzibad\\" oder \\"Max-Frisch-Bad\\" genannt). Er eröffnete daraufhin sein eigenes Architekturbüro und beschäftigte zeitweise zwei Zeichner. Wegen kriegsbedingter Materialknappheit konnte der Bau erst 1947 beginnen. Das 1949 eröffnete Bad steht heute unter Denkmalschutz und wurde 2006/2007 im Zuge einer Totalsanierung wieder weitgehend in den Originalzustand gebracht. Es ist Frischs einziger öffentlicher Bau und gilt mit seinen gestalterischen Qualitäten aus architekturgeschichtlicher Sicht als Referenzentwurf., Insgesamt entwarf Frisch ein gutes Dutzend Bauwerke, von denen neben dem Freibad einzig zwei Einfam: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Hierbei orientiert sie sich an dem koranischen Prinzip des Gebietens des Rechten und Verbietens des Verwerflichen. Weitere Ziele der Organisation sind Daʿwa, Dschihad und die Errichtung eines internationalen Kalifats. Die FPI hat eine antikommunistische, antizionistische und antiamerikanische Ausrichtung und bekämpft auch die Ahmadiyya und den liberalen Islam., Die FPI wurde am 17. August 1998 wenige Monate nach dem Rücktritt von Staatspräsident Suharto gegründet und hat Ableger in 28 indonesischen Provinzen. Über die Anzahl ihrer Mitglieder gibt es sehr unterschiedliche Angaben, die zwischen 100.000 und sieben Millionen differieren. Die meisten FPI-Mitglieder leben in der Metropolregion Jakarta. Geistiger Führer der FPI ist der arabische Gelehrte und Prophetennachkomme al-Habib Rizieq bin Hussein Syihab, dessen Familie aus dem Hadramaut stammt. Er wird von seinen Anhängern als „Groß-Imam“ \\"(imam besar)\\" verehrt. Nachdem verschiedene Strafanzeigen gegen ihn gestellt worden waren, floh er im Mai 2017 nach Saudi-Arabien. Am 10. November 2020 kehrt er nach Jakarta zurück und wurde von Tausenden von Anhängern in einem Triumphzug empfangen. Nach weiteren FPI-Massenveranstaltungen, bei denen gegen COVID-19-Hygienebestimmungen verstoßen wurde, wurde er am 12. Dezember 2020 in Haft genommen., Die International Crisis Group hat 2008 geurteilt, dass es sich bei der FPI eigentlich um eine „städtische Gangsterorganisation“ \\"(urban thug organisation)\\" handelt. Doch hat die Organisation auch viele Sympathisanten in den staatlichen Institutionen (Armee, Polizei und Justiz) Indonesiens und arbeitete eng mit verschiedenen islamischen Parteien zusammen. Deswegen und aufgrund der religiösen Rechtfertigung der FPI für ihr organisiertes gewaltsames Vorgehen hatte der Staat lange Zeit Schwierigkeiten, ihre Aktivitäten als rein kriminelle Aktivitäten zu behandeln. Am 30. Dezember 2020 hat die indonesische Regierung die FPI jedoch mit einem interministeriellen Dekret verboten. In dem Dekret, das von sechs Behördenleiter mit Ministerstatus unterschrieben ist, begründet die Regierung das Verbot unter anderem damit, dass die FPI eine Bedrohung für die nationale Ideologie der Pancasila darstellt, die FPI-Satzung gegen die indonesische Verfassung verstößt und in der Vergangenheit zahlreiche FPI-Mitglieder an terroristischen und kriminellen Aktivitäten teilgenommen haben. Durch das Dekret ist die FPI offiziell aufgelöst, ihre Aktivitäten und das Zeigen von FPI-Attributen und -Symbolen sind seither verboten., Gründung und Name., Die FPI wurde am Abend des 17. August 1998 in der Pesantren-Schule \\"al-Umm\\" in Kampung Utan, Ciputat gegründet. Der Ort liegt im Süden Jakartas, gehört aber heute zur Provinz Banten.

Die Religionsgelehrten in dieser Liste lassen sich daran erkennen, dass vor ihrem Namen die Abkürzung K.H. (= Kiai Haji) steht. Kiai ist eine indonesische Anrede für ehrwürdige islamische Gelehrte, Haji bedeutet Mekkapilger., Anfangs bestanden die FPI-Mitglieder hauptsächlich aus den Anhängern dieser Gründungsmitglieder. So wurden zum Beispiel alle Schüler des Pesantren al-Umm aufgerufen, die FPI zu unterstützen., Nach Rizieq Syihab erfolgte die Gründung der FPI spontan, ohne dass ihr ein formaler Prozess vorausging. Allerdings sei die Bildung der Organisation durch die Gründungsmitglieder in unbewusster Weise schon während der Herrschaft von Suharto in den 1990er Jahren angebahnt worden., Bei ihrer Gründung wurde die FPI verdächtigt, ein politisches Instrument des kurz zuvor gestürzten Suharto-Regimes zu sein. Rizieq Syihab weist dies jedoch als „infame Propaganda“ \\"(propaganda keji)\\" zurück. Nach Purnomo hatten die meisten der FPI-Gründer vorher das Suharto-Regime bekämpft. Insbesondere Habib Idrus Jamalullail hatte das Suharto-Regime scharf kritisiert. Nach Auffassung von FPI-Mitgliedern, die Purnomo interviewt hat, war die Orde-Baru-Zeit in Wirklichkeit eine „Ordnung der Diebe“ \\"(Orde Maling)\\" gewesen. Rizieq Syihab nennt zwei Gründe als Hintergrund für die Gründung der FPI:, In den 2003 beschlossenen Statuten der FPI wird die Zusammensetzung ihres Namens folgendermaßen erklärt:, Ideologische Entwicklung., Verteidigung der Muslime, Abwehr der „Christianisierung“ Indonesiens., Die Idee, dass die FPI als Organisation der Verteidigung der Muslime dient, war besonders in der Anfangszeit stark ausgeprägt. Kurz nach ihrer Gründung schickte die FPI ein Investigationsteam nach Banyuwangi in Ostjava, um dort vorgefallene Morde an islamischen Geistlichen zu untersuchen. Sie kam zu dem Schluss, dass diese Morde vor allem durch als Ninja-Krieger verkleidete Personen verübt worden seien. Deshalb erklärte sie am 28. Oktober 1998 in einer Fatwa dieser Ninja-Gruppe den Dschihad. Einen Monat später, am 22. November 1998, war die FPI an einer blutigen Auseinandersetzung mit einer christlichen ambonesischen Miliz in Ketapang in Zentral-Jakarta beteiligt. Nach Angaben der FPI begann diese Auseinandersetzung, als nach einer Auseinandersetzung an einem Spiellokal mehrere hundert Ambonesen am frühen Morgen den Ort überfielen und eine Moschee niederbrannten. Als sich diese Nachricht in Jakarta verbreitete, kamen mehrere tausend Muslime nach Ketapang, darunter auch 300 FPI-Kämpfer. Diese schlugen die ambonesischen Sicherheitsleute zurück und töteten 15 von ihnen. Nach diesem Vorfall begann die FPI, neue Mitglieder zu rekrutieren. Als eine Woche später Christen in Kupang, der Hauptstadt der indonesischen Provinz Nusa Tenggara Timur, Moscheen niederbrannten und auch einige Muslime töteten, gab die FPI eine Erklärung ab, in der sie diese Aktionen scharf verurteilte., Außerdem verlangte die FPI die Aufarbeitung von Menschenrechtsverletzungen gegen Muslime während der Orde-Baru-Zeit. Die FPI-Führung sieht diese Periode sehr negativ: Die Regierung sei von Christen dominiert gewesen und mit ihrer Hilfe habe eine Christianisierung Indonesiens stattgefunden. 80 Prozent der Bestechungsdelikte von Beamten während dieser Zeit seien von Christen begangen worden. Am 29. März 1999 forderte die FPI in einer öffentlichen Erklärung die Untersuchung der Rolle des christlichen Generals Leonardus Benyamin Moerdani im Zusammenhang mit bestimmten Unruhen. Dies bezog sich auf das Massaker von Tanjung Priok, einen Vorfall im September 1984 in der Nähe von Jakarta, bei dem die indonesische Armee eine große Anzahl von Muslimen getötet hatte. Die Armee war dabei von Moerdani befehligt worden., Am 10. Januar 2000 führten 200 FPI-Mitglieder eine Demonstration vor der Zentrale der Nationalen Kommission für Menschenrechte \\"(Komnas HAM)\\" in Menteng Jakarta durch und verlangten ihre Auflösung. Bei der Gelegenheit hängten sie an dem Gebäude ein Banner auf, auf dem stand: „Die Komnas HAM wird von der FPI versiegelt“ \\"(Komnas HAM Disegel oleh FPI)\\". Die FPI kritisierte, dass die Kommission 1. Menschenrechtsverletzungen gegen Muslime, wie bei den muslimisch-christlichen Konflikten auf Ambon, dem Massaker von Tanjung Priok und der Militäroperation in Aceh ignoriere und 2. sich allein auf Menschenrechtsverletzungen in Osttimor konzentriere und nur muslimische Top-Generale verdächtige. Dies betrachtete sie als Diskriminierung von Muslimen. Darüber hinaus verlangte die FPI die Entlassung von fünf Mitgliedern der Kommission, die sie als Ursache des Problems ansah. Wegen der großen Zahl der in der Kommission vertretenen Christen war die FPI der Auffassung, dass dieses Gremium parteiisch sei., Die FPI sieht die Muslime Indonesiens vor allem durch das Christentum bedroht. In einem Positionspapier, das die Organisation auf ihrer ersten Nationalversammlung im Dezember 2003 beschloss, wird die FPI aufgefordert, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um einer Christianisierung zuvorzukommen. Mehrere der bisherigen FPI-Aktionen richteten sich auch gegen christliche Kirchen. So zündeten am 2. November 1999 mehrere hundert FPI-Aktivisten eine protestantische Kirche südlich von Jakarta an. Außerdem ging die FPI immer wieder gegen sogenannte „Wilde Kirchen“ \\"(gereja liar)\\" vor, Kirchen, die ohne Erlaubnis in muslimischen Siedlungsgebieten errichtet wurden. Im Juni 2007 verübte die FPI einen Angriff auf eine Kirche der Assemblies of God in Katapang, Soreang, Westjava. Am 8. August 2010 griffen hunderte FPI-Anhänger Mitglieder der Christlich-Protestantischen Batak-Kirche (HKBP) in Bekasi während des Gottesdienstes an. Als die Gottesdienstbesucher nach Hause gingen, wurden sie von den FPI-Anhängern verfolgt und geschlagen. Die FPI war der Auffassung, dass die HKBP-Kirche unzulässigerweise errichtet worden sei, und hatte schon vorher mehrfach den Gottesdienst gestört., Rizieq Syihab verwahrt sich allerdings gegen den Vorwurf, dass die FPI intolerant sei und sich gegenüber den Ungläubigen feindselig verhalte. Vielmehr halte die FPI den in Sure 109:6 ausgesprochenen Grundsatz „Ihr habt Eure Religion, und ich die meine“ sehr hoch. Nach den Selbstmordanschlägen auf drei Kirchen in Surabaya im Mai 2018 veröffentlichte die FPI eine Presseerklärung, in der sie diese Anschläge kritisierte und erklärte, dass sie terroristische Gewalt gegen andere Religionsgemeinschaften ablehne. Gleichzeitig rief sie darin aber auch die Öffentlichkeit dazu auf, die Anschläge nicht mit irgendeiner bestimmten religiösen Lehre und ihren Anhängern in Verbindung zu bringen., Anti-Kommunismus und Anti-Zionismus., Die FPI sieht seit ihrer Gründung besonders den Kommunismus als Feind an. Als die FPI am 24. September 1998 erstmals öffentlich in Erscheinung trat, geschah dies mit einem Angriff auf studentische Aktivisten bei der katholischen Atmajaya-Universität. Dieser sollte „linksgerichtete und christliche Studenten, die: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Dadurch werden Lungenarteriolen oder Kapillaren verlegt und das Gerinnungssystem beeinträchtigt. Sie ist eine seltene, aber gefährliche und von Geburtshelfern gefürchtete Notfallsituation, da sie meist dramatisch verläuft und oft tödlich endet. Überlebende Mütter und Kinder erleiden häufig Hirnschäden., Die Fruchtwasserembolie wird synonym auch als \\"Geburtshilfliches Schock-Syndrom\\", \\"Amnioninfusionssyndrom\\" ( – AFE), \\"Anaphylaktisches Schwangerschaftssyndrom\\" () oder \\"Steiner-Lushbaugh-Syndrom\\" bezeichnet. Die Vorgänge wurden 1926 von J.Ricardo Meyer erstmals beschrieben und 1941 von Steiner und Lushbaugh als eigenständige Krankheit definiert., Bis heute ist eine Fruchtwasserembolie nicht vorhersehbar und nur schlecht zu diagnostizieren und zu behandeln. Vorbeugende Maßnahmen sind nicht bekannt., Vorkommen., Die Angaben in der medizinischen Fachliteratur zur Häufigkeit (Inzidenz) der Fruchtwasserembolie schwanken erheblich und werden mit einem Erkrankungsfall auf 800 bis 80.000 Geburten angegeben. In Industrieländern wird eine Inzidenz von 1:20.000 bis 80.000 Geburten angenommen. Die unterschiedlichen Angaben zur Inzidenz rühren daher, dass es schwierig ist, eine sichere Diagnose zu stellen. In Großbritannien ist die Fruchtwasserembolie die vierthäufigste Ursache für mütterliche Todesfälle mit einer Häufigkeit von 0,77 pro 100.000 Entbindungen. In Australien wurde sie im Zeitraum von 1964 bis 1990 als Todesursache bei 0,9 von 100.000 Entbindungen registriert. In Frankreich war dies von 1996 bis 1998 bei 1,5 und in den Jahren 1999 bis 2001 bei 0,5 von 100.000 Entbindungen der Fall., Innerhalb der ersten Stunde sterben 25 bis 34 % der Mütter. Nur 16 bis 20 % der Mütter überleben letztlich ein solches Ereignis. 70 % aller Fruchtwasserembolien ereignen sich unter der Geburt, 11 % nach der vaginalen Entbindung und 19 % während eines Kaiserschnitts nach Entwicklung des Kindes. Die kindliche Sterblichkeit beträgt bei Fruchtwasserembolien, die sich vor oder während der Geburt ereignen, bis zu 50 %., Obwohl eine Fruchtwasserembolie fast immer unter oder kurz nach der Geburt auftritt, existieren auch Einzelfallberichte über Fruchtwasserembolien im ersten und zweiten Schwangerschaftsdrittel. Das Krankheitsgeschehen setzte dort in Verbindung mit invasivem Vorgehen bei verhaltener Fehlgeburt oder Aborteinleitung ein, wurde jedoch noch nicht bei Ausschabungen wegen einer Fehlgeburt beobachtet. Auch bei der, selten durchgeführten, Infusion von physiologischer Kochsalzlösung in die Amnionhöhle zur Mekoniumaspirationsprophylaxe und bei einer Fruchtwasserpunktion wurden mehrere Fälle von Fruchtwasserembolie beschrieben. Ebenso kann stumpfe Gewalt gegen den Bauch (Abdominaltrauma) zur Fruchtwasserembolie führen., Krankheitsentstehung., Die Pathophysiologie der Fruchtwasserembolie ist bis heute nicht vollständig geklärt. Einerseits handelt es sich um eine Sonderform der Lungenembolie, die durch den Kontakt von Fruchtwasserbestandteilen mit dem mütterlichen Blutkreislauf ausgelöst wird. Dabei besteht oft ein zeitlicher Zusammenhang zum Blasensprung, sodass dieser als eine mögliche Ursache angesehen wird. Andererseits wird ein ganzer Komplex an Reaktionen ausgelöst, der über eine Embolie weit hinausgeht., Das Fruchtwasser dringt über das eröffnete Bett der Plazenta (Plazentahaftstelle), über eine Verletzung des Venengeflechts der Gebärmutter oder über Verletzungen von Gefäßen des Gebärmutterhalses in das venöse System der Mutter ein. Von dort aus gelangt es über die rechte Herzseite in die Lungenarterien oder aber über Shunts im Herzen oder in der Lunge in die linke Herzseite und dann in den Körperkreislauf., Die Mechanismen bei der Entstehung der Fruchtwasserembolie sind nur in Teilen bekannt. Die Erklärungen der Vorgänge beruhen auf klinischen Beobachtungen und teilweise auf Tierversuchen., Es führt jedoch nicht jeder Kontakt von Fruchtwasser und seinen Bestandteilen mit dem mütterlichen Kreislauf zu einer Fruchtwasserembolie. 1961 war zwar bei fast der Hälfte von 220 mütterlichen Todesfällen Trophoblast-Gewebe in der Lunge nachgewiesen worden, allerdings hatte weniger als 1 % der Frauen klinische Hinweise auf eine Fruchtwasserembolie gezeigt. Normalerweise gelangen nur geringe Fruchtwassermengen (1 bis 2ml) unter der Geburt in den mütterlichen Kreislauf. Um die Reaktionskette in Gang zu setzen, muss eine größere Menge Fruchtwasser in den mütterlichen Kreislauf übertreten., Risikofaktoren., Als prädisponierende Faktoren für das Krankheitsbild gelten die Uterusruptur, Geburtsverletzungen (z.B. hoher Scheidenriss, Zervixriss), die manuelle Plazentalösung, eine vorzeitige Plazentalösung, vaginal-operative Entbindungen, ein erhöhter intrauteriner Druck (z.B. bei großem Kind, Mehrlingen oder Polyhydramnion), die Kristellerhilfe (durch die Stempelwirkung) und eine Wehenmittelüberdosierung. Allerdings bestand in einigen Untersuchungen keine Beziehungen zu fetaler Makrosomie und zu einer Überdosierung des Wehenmittels Oxytocin., Außerdem fanden kanadische Forscher ein häufigeres Auftreten von Fruchtwasserembolien im Zusammenhang mit einem Schwangerschaftsdiabetes, mit einer Präeklampsie, mit einem höheren Alter der Mutter, mit einem Kaiserschnitt und mit einer Geburtseinleitung. 88 % der Betroffenen sind Mehrgebärende. Bei 41 % der Patientinnen mit einer Fruchtwasserembolie finden sich anamnestisch Hinweise auf Allergien oder Atopie. Zudem wurde eine Fruchtwasserembolie gehäuft im Zusammenhang mit männlichen Föten beobachtet., Die prädisponierenden Faktoren erhöhen zwar das Risiko einer Fruchtwasserembolie, können jedoch nicht als deren Ursache angesehen werden. Das Krankheitsbild gilt als unvorhersehbar. Vorbeugende Maßnahmen sind nicht bekannt., Symptomatik und Verlauf., Klinische Kriterien., Die nationalen Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)-Register in den USA und Großbritannien stellten klinische Kriterien auf, die die Verdachtsdiagnose einer Fruchtwasserembolie erlauben:, Phasen., Eine Fruchtwasserembolie läuft in mehreren Stadien ab, von denen jedes potentiell tödlich ist., Als Vorzeichen können Atembeschwerden, Kältegefühl, innere Unruhe, Lichtscheu, Angstzustände, Empfindungsstörungen der Finger, Übelkeit und Erbrechen auftreten. Das Intervall zwischen diesen ersten Anzeichen und der akuten Symptomatik kann sehr kurz sein, aber auch bis zu 4Stunden betragen., Im Frühstadium, innerhalb der ersten Minuten, zeigen die Patientinnen aus völligem Wohlbefinden Atemnot mit Zyanose und Krampfanfälle. Zudem finden sich Schockzeichen. Brustschmerzen treten, entgegen früheren Annahmen, bei über der Hälfte der Frauen auf. Heftige Wehen bis hin zur Uterustetanie bestehen bei etwa einem Viertel der Frauen., Überlebt die Frau diese erste Phase, treten im zweiten Stadium mit einer Latenzzeit von 0,5 bis 12Stunden Blutungen auf, die Folge der generalisierten Gerinnung mit Verbrauchskoagulopathie sind. Aufgrund der großen Wundflächen nach Ablösen der Plazenta besteht das Risiko, an einem hämorrhagischen Schock zu versterben., Im Spätstadium entwickelt sich ein Atemnotsyndrom mit Lungenödem. Es kommt zu einer Hyperfibrinolyse und als Folge des Schocks möglicherweise zu einem Multiorganversagen. Da die zweite und dritte Phase fließend ineinander übergehen, werden sie häufig auch zusammengefasst und der gesamte Verlauf als biphasisch bezeichnet., Kindliche Reaktionen., Beim Ungeborenen kommt es durch die verminderte Sauerstoffversorgung zu Herzfrequenzveränderungen. Diese äußern sich als Auffälligkeiten im CTG, wie Tachykardie, späte Dezelerationen, eine Abnahme der Bandbreite, verlängerte variable Dezelerationen und Bradykardie. Allerdings sind auch Fälle mit unauffälligem CTG trotz bestehender fetaler Bedrohung beschrieben. Wird die Sauerstoffversorgung nicht schnell verbessert oder kein Notkaiserschnitt durchgeführt, stirbt das Kind nach kurzer Zeit (intrauteriner Fruchttod)., Diagnosestellung., Die klinische Diagnose einer Fruchtwasserembolie ist eine Ausschlussdiagnose. Sie muss wegen des hochakuten Geschehens schnell gestellt werden, damit schon bei dem Verdacht entsprechende Maßnahmen eingeleitet werden können. Dabei müssen differentialdiagnostisch verschiedene Erkrankungen in Betracht gezogen werden., Laborchemisch zeigen sich Zeichen der Verbrauchskoagulopathie:, Im EKG finden sich anfangs eine Tachykardie und ST-Strecken-Veränderungen, später Zeichen der Rechtsherzbelastung. Die Sauerstoffsättigung im Blut ist reduziert. Selbst ein Nachweis von fetalen Bestandteilen im Blut aus der rechten Herzkammer kann die Diagnose nur stützen, aber nicht beweisen., Sicher diagnostizieren kann man eine Fruchtwasserembolie erst post mortem im Rahmen einer Obduktion, indem man histologisch Fruchtwasser oder korpuskuläre Anteile in den Kapillaren der Lunge nachweist. Dies dient oftmals auch dazu, vermutete Behandlungsfehler durch Ärzte und Hebammen auszuschließen., Therapie., Eine spezifische oder ursächliche Behandlung der Fruchtwasserembolie ist nicht möglich. Die Behandlung der Patientin erfolgt bereits bei Verdacht auf eine Fruchtwasserembolie symptomatisch, jedoch intensivmedizinisch. Dabei steht die Stabilisierung des Zustands der Patientin im Vordergrund., Fast immer ist eine endotracheale Intubation mit einer künstlichen Beatmung notwendig. Durch Infusion (als Volumenersatz) wird, möglichst unter Kontrolle des zentralen Venendrucks, dem Blutdruckabfall entgegengewirkt. Indem Medikamente, die die Lungenstrombahn erweitern, verabreicht werden, wird einer Rechtsherzinsuffizienz entgegengewirkt. Um die immunologischen Komponenten zu behandeln, ist es sinnvoll, Glucocorticoide zu geben., Lässt sich der mütterliche Zustand stabilisieren, ist eine rasche vaginale Entbindung möglich. Kommt es innerhalb von 4 bis 5Minuten zu keiner Verbesserung, ist aufgrund des drohenden Todes des Kindes ein Notkaiserschnitt, auch bei scheinbar sterbender Mutter \\"(Peri-mortem-Schnittentbindung)\\", angezeigt.

Jahrhundert), Gemälde von Édouard Manet, J. Paul Getty Museum, Werk der Porträtmalerei], Der Frühling oder Jeanne ( oder \\"Jeanne\\") ist ein Gemälde des französischen Malers Édouard Manet. Das 1881 in Öl auf Leinwand gemalte Werk hat eine Höhe von 74cm und eine Breite von 51,5cm. Es zeigt die spätere Schauspielerin Jeanne Demarsy in einem eleganten weißen Kleid mit Blütendekor vor einem Pflanzenhintergrund. Das Bild ist Teil einer geplanten Reihe, bei der die vier Jahreszeiten durch Frauen dargestellt werden sollten. Hiervon kamen jedoch nur die Motive Frühling und Herbst zur Ausführung. Manet zeigte \\"Der Frühling\\" 1882 im Salon de Paris, wo es von der Kritik positiv aufgenommen wurde. Nach dem Bild entstanden verschiedene Radierungen und es wurde bereits 1882 farbig reproduziert. Das Gemälde \\"Der Frühling\\" gehört zur Sammlung des J. Paul Getty Museums in Los Angeles., Bildbeschreibung., Das Gemälde zeigt eine junge Frau als Halbfigur in Profilansicht vor einem floralen Hintergrund. Dargestellt ist die etwa sechzehnjährige Jeanne Demarsy, die Manet in diesem Bild in der Gestalt des Frühlings porträtierte. Das zum linken Bildrand weisende Gesicht hat einen hellen Teint, der in Teilbereichen eine leichte Roséfärbung aufweist. Die Kontur von der Stirn über die Stupsnase und die üppigen roten Lippen bis zum Kinn ist mit feiner Linie gezeichnet. Ihre braunen Augen blicken geradeaus zum Bildrand oder, wie der Kunsthistoriker Gotthard Jedlicka schreibt, „mit jugendlicher, fast kindlicher Nachdenklichkeit vor sich hin“. Deutlich zu erkennen sind die langen Wimpern und dichten dunklen Augenbrauen. Ihr ebenfalls dunkles Haar schaut in leicht gelockter Form unter einer Capote (Kapotthut) hervor., Die Capote ist nach vorn mit reicher weißer Rüschendekoration versehen. Auf dem bräunlichen Hut sind als Verzierung verschiedene Blüten in Mauve und Gelb-Weiß angebracht. Breite dunkle Bänder reichen vom hinteren Teil der Capote entlang des Halses nach vorn und sind unter dem Kinn zu einer Schleife gebunden. Neben dem Hut gehört das eng anliegende weiße Kleid mit Blumendekor zur modischen Aufmachung der Jeanne Demarsy. Es ist zum Hals hin geschlossen und hat eine Kürasstaille (auch \\"Geigentaille\\"), wie sie für die Pariser Damenmode um 1880 typisch ist. Der im Bild zu sehende halblange Ärmel reicht bis über den Ellenbogen. Während der Stoff am Oberarm ebenfalls eng anliegend ist, fällt er am weit geschnittenen Ärmelende in Falten nach unten. Das weiße Kleid ist mit einem floralen Muster versehen, bei dem im oberen Bereich detailreich einzelne blaue und gelbe Blüten sowie grüne Blätter zu erkennen sind. Zum unteren Bildrand hin hat Manet diese Feinmalerei durch einen impressionistischen Pinseldukuts ersetzt. Hier verschwimmen die Einzelheiten des Stoffmusters und werden durch kurze, vertikale Pinselstriche ersetzt., Der dem Bildbetrachter zugewandte linke Unterarm steckt in einem langen beigefarbenen Handschuh, der bis unter den Ärmel des Kleides reicht, sodass hier keine Haut zu sehen ist. Am Handgelenk trägt Mademoiselle Demarsy einen schmalen Goldreif mit einer kleinen Perle oder einem Edelstein. Die linke Hand umfasst den Stock eines Sonnenschirms, den sie \\"wie ein Soldat sein Gewehr\\" über die Schulter gelegt hat. Der geöffnete Sonnenschirm (auch \\"Parasol\\") füllt die obere rechte Ecke aus und wird vom rechten Seitenrand abgeschnitten. Er ist – ähnlich wie die Handschuhe – mit einem beigefarbenen Stoff bespannt und am Rand mit einer Spitzenbordüre versehen., Hinter Jeanne Demarsy steht ein üppiger Strauch mit zahlreichen grünen Blättern. Möglicherweise handelt es sich hierbei um Rhododendron, der im Frühjahr seine Blüten hervorbringt. Eine solche Blüte ist außerdem in der linken oberen Ecke zu sehen, wo der blaue Himmel hinter dem Strauch durchscheint. Im Geäst am unteren rechten Bildrand geht der Blick auf eine hinter dem Strauch befindliche Wiese. Möglicherweise ist hier eine Gartenbank skizziert. Bei zwei rechts oberhalb der Schulter platzierten roten Farbtupfern könnte es sich um weitere Blüten, aber auch um das Dach eines Hauses handeln. Das Bild ist am unteren Bildrand links im Pflanzengrün neben dem Kleid mit „Manet 1881“ in Schwarz signiert., Für Gotthard Jedlicka stellt die im Hintergrund zu sehende „Gartenwildnis“ einen Gegensatz zur „städtischen Anmut“ der Porträtierten dar. Er sieht im Gesicht der jungen Frau „eine Frucht“, die wie „der Frühling selber auf seine Entfaltung zu warten scheint“. Die Kunsthistorikerin Juliet Wilson-Bareau betont, im Zusammenspiel von geblümtem Kleid, Sonnenschirm, Blumen auf dem Hütchen, blauem Himmel und Blattwerk „erweckt das Bild von Jeanne die Vorstellung von Frühling unmittelbar“., \\"Der Frühling\\" als Teil eines Jahreszeitenzyklus., Das Gemälde \\"Der Frühling\\" gehört zu einem von Manet geplanten Zyklus, bei dem schöne Frauen die vier Jahreszeiten darstellen sollten. Die Idee hierzu kam von Manets Schulfreund Antonin Proust, der das Bild \\"Der Frühling\\" später erwarb. Die Jahreszeiten durch weibliche Figuren personifiziert abzubilden, hat eine lange Tradition und findet sich bereits in der hellenistischen und römischen Kunst. Seit der Renaissance wandten sich Maler diesem Thema immer wieder zu und wählten neben Frauenporträts auch Landschaftsbilder, um die vier Jahreszeiten darzustellen. So malte Manets Zeitgenosse Camille Pissarro 1872 die vier Jahreszeiten als impressionistische Landschaften. Manet hatte aber weder die Absicht, Landschaften zu malen, noch im engeren Sinne die von ihm porträtierten Frauen als Allegorien darzustellen. Für ihn lag der Fokus in der Darstellung auf der „typischen Pariserin“ – attraktive junge Frauen in modischer Kleidung, wie sie der \\"Flaneur\\" bei seinen Spaziergängen in den Straßen von Paris oder im Jardin des Tuileries beobachten konnte., Als erstes Bild von Manets geplanter Reihe entstand das Gemälde \\"Der Frühling\\". Für die Bildkomposition einer weiblichen Figur im Halbprofil vor einem Hintergrund mit Gartenpflanzen könnte das \\"Porträt einer Prinzessin aus dem Hause Este\\" von Antonio Pisanello Vorbild gewesen sein, das Manet von seinen zahlreichen Besuchen im Louvre sicher kannte. Für die Frau im weißen Kleid mit Blütendekor liegt ein Bezug zur Figur der Flora im Gemälde Primavera von Sandro Botticelli nahe. Manet hatte das Bild während einer Italienreise 1853 in den Uffizien in Florenz gesehen. Eine weitere Inspiration zu diesem Gemälde Manets waren vermutlich auch die japanischen Ukiyo-e-Holzschnitte, die er spätestens seit der Pariser Weltausstellung 1867 kannte. In der von Kitagawa Utamaro geschaffenen Reihe mit Kurtisanenporträts befindet sich beispielsweise die Darstellung der \\"Kurtisane Hanaôgi aus dem Ogiya-Haus\\", die wie Manets Jeanne Demarsy in \\"Der Frühling\\" im geblümten Kleid als Halbfigur zu sehen ist., Manet malte \\"Der Frühling\\" nicht in freier Natur, wie der blühende Strauch im Hintergrund vermuten lassen könnte. Jacques-Émile Blanche berichtet, dass es in seinem Atelier in der Pariser Rue d’Amsterdam entstand. Als Modell wählte er die junge, sechzehnjährige Jeanne Demarsy, die Jahre später als Schauspielerin auf Pariser Theaterbühnen stand. Manets Biograf Adolphe Tabarant beschrieb sie als \\"bien jolie, mignonne, pimpante, effrontée, un papillon de boulevard\\" („sehr hübsch, reizend, adrett, frech, ein Boulevard-Schmetterling“). Andere Autoren werden zur Rolle von Jeanne Demarsy in der Pariser Gesellschaft deutlicher und bezeichnen sie als „Halbweltlerin“ oder zählen sie zur „Creme der Pariser Kurtisanenszene“. Manet hat sie mehrfach porträtiert, beispielsweise als Brustbildnis \\"Junge Frau mit Pelerine\\" (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon). Im Pastell \\"Auf der Bank\\" (Pola Museum of Art, Hakone) erscheint ihr Kopf wie in \\"Der Frühling\\" im Profil vor einem floralen Hintergrund., Mindestens ebenso wichtig wie die Wahl des Modells war für Manet die Auswahl der richtigen Garderobe. Er folgte hierbei den Ansichten des Schriftstellers Charles Baudelaire, der die Aufgabe des modernen Malers darin sah, „das Poetische der zeitgenössischen Kleidung zu erfassen“. Manet war fasziniert von der aktuellen Damenbekleidung und begleitete oftmals seine weiblichen Bekanntschaften in die Modehäuser von Paris. Für das Gemälde \\"Der Frühling\\" erstand er eigens bei der bekannten Modistin Madame Virot einen blumengeschmückten Hut, und bei Madame Derot suchte er den Stoff für das Kleid aus. Nach den Sitzungen von Jeanne Demarsy im Atelier bat er sie, ihm das Kleid auszuleihen, damit er in ihrer Abwesenheit im Gemälde die Stoffpartien weiterbearbeiten könne. Von Jacques-Émile Blanche ist überliefert, wie sehr Manet bemüht gewesen sei, den seidigen Glanz des Stoffes im Bild festzuhalten. Selbst der blaue Himmel im Hintergrund habe Manet Schwierigkeiten bereitet, da er zu viel Dominanz von der Farbe befürchtete., Nach Fertigstellung des Gemäldes \\"Der Frühling\\" wandte sich Manet in der Jahreszeitenfolge dem Thema Herbst zu. Er bat hierfür, ebenfalls 1881, seine 32Jahre alte Freundin Méry Laurent Modell zu stehen. Sie ist heute weniger für ihre Bühnenkarriere als Schauspielerin bekannt, sondern als Kurtisane, die von finanziellen Zuwendungen wohlhabender Männer lebte. Auch von ihr hatte Manet bereits zuvor eine Reihe anderer Bildnisse gemalt. Für das Porträt mit dem Titel \\"Herbst\\" (Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nancy) hatte Méry Laurent extra eine mit Pelz besetzte Jacke im Modehaus von Charles Frederick Worth erworben. Wie vorher im Gemälde \\"Der Frühling\\" ist auch der Hintergrund bei Méry Laurent im \\"Herbst\\" mit Blüten geschmückt. Statt in einer Gartenszene steht sie allerdings vor einem als Wandbehang genutzten japanischen Gewand. Die Kunsthistorikerin Manuela B. Mena Marqués hat auf die enge Verbindung zwischen Frauen und Blumen in Manets Werk hingewiesen. Bereits in seinen Gemälden aus den 1860er Jahren gibt es immer wieder Darstellungen von Frauen, denen Blumen als Dekoration beigegeben sind. Beispielsweise ist der weibliche liegende Akt im Bild \\"Olympia\\" mit einer Blume im Haar geschmückt und in \\"Der Balkon\\" gibt es neben einer Frau mit blumenverziertem Hut eine blühende Topfpflanze, die neben der sitzenden weiblichen Hauptfigur platziert ist. Für Manet – so Mena Marqués – seien Blumen die natürlich Ergänzung zu Frauen. Beide zeichneten sich durch ihre flüchtige, zarte und sinnliche Schönheit aus und selbst ihr Duft sei in einer Epoche der schweren Parfums ähnlich.

Jahrhunderts bis ca. 1050. Dem Frühmittelalter geht die Spätantike (ca. 300 bis 600/700) voran, eine Transformationszeit, die sich teils mit dem beginnenden Frühmittelalter überschneidet. Auf das Frühmittelalter folgen das Hoch- und das Spätmittelalter., Das Frühmittelalter ist als Übergang von der Antike zum Mittelalter sowie als eigenständige Epoche von Bedeutung. Beginn und Ende werden in der historischen Forschung unterschiedlich datiert, so dass verschieden breite Übergangszeiträume betrachtet werden. Entgegen der älteren Deutung als „dunkle“ oder „rückständige“ Epoche wird das Frühmittelalter in der modernen Forschung wesentlich differenzierter betrachtet. Es ist sowohl von Kontinuitäten als auch vom Wandel im politischen, kulturellen und gesellschaftlichen Bereich gekennzeichnet, was Auswirkungen bis in die Moderne hat. So begann die fortdauernde Teilung Europas und des Mittelmeerraums in einen christlichen und einen islamischen Teil sowie des christlichen Teils in einen lateinischen und einen orthodoxen, der den Kulturkreis von Byzanz umfasste. Mehrere der im Frühmittelalter entstandenen Reiche bildeten außerdem die Grundlage für heute noch existierende Staaten., Der Beginn des Frühmittelalters ist mit der sogenannten Völkerwanderung verknüpft, in deren Verlauf das weströmische Kaisertum 476 unterging. Die römischen Verwaltungsstrukturen im Westen verschwanden nur langsam, auf dem Boden des Westreiches entstanden neue germanisch-romanische Reiche. Das von den Merowingern im späten 5. Jahrhundert gegründete Frankenreich entwickelte sich zum bedeutendsten Nachfolgereich im Westen. Im Osten behauptete sich hingegen Ostrom, das im 6. Jahrhundert sogar einige verlorene Territorien im Westen zurückerobern konnte. Allerdings gingen große Teile der eroberten Gebiete bald wieder verloren. Ostrom bzw. Byzanz befand sich zudem bis ins frühe 7. Jahrhundert im Abwehrkampf gegen die persischen Sāsāniden. Im 7./8. Jahrhundert veränderte sich infolge der arabischen Eroberungen die politische Ordnung im Mittelmeerraum grundlegend. Dies bedeutete das endgültige Ende der Antike. Der ehemals byzantinisch kontrollierte Raum im Vorderen Orient und in Nordafrika wurde von den muslimischen Arabern besetzt und langsam islamisiert. Auch auf der Iberischen Halbinsel und auf Sizilien hielten sich längere Zeit islamische Herrschaften. Im Osten eroberten die Araber Persien und drangen bis nach Zentralasien vor., Im 8. Jahrhundert übernahmen im Frankenreich die Karolinger die Herrschaft. Unter ihnen entwickelte sich das Frankenreich zur Hegemonialmacht im Westen. Damit verbunden war eine Verlagerung des politischen Schwerpunkts vom Mittelmeerraum nach West- und Mitteleuropa und eine neue Phase der „staatlichen Ordnung“ in Europa. Unter Karl dem Großen, der im Jahr 800 an das westliche Kaisertum anknüpfte, umfasste das Frankenreich den Kernteil der lateinischen Christenheit vom Norden Spaniens bis in den rechtsrheinischen Raum und nach Mittelitalien. Aus dem im 9. Jahrhundert zerfallenden Karolingerreich entstanden das Westfrankenreich und das Ostfrankenreich, aus denen sich später Frankreich und Deutschland entwickelten. In Ostfranken stiegen im 10. Jahrhundert die Liudolfinger auf, erlangten die westliche Kaiserwürde und legten die Grundlage für das römisch-deutsche Reich, das auch Reichsitalien umfasste. Frankreich und England entwickelten sich schließlich zu territorial geschlossenen Herrschaftsräumen. Politisch waren das 10. und 11. Jahrhundert in den karolingischen Nachfolgereichen, auf der Iberischen Halbinsel und in England eine Konsolidierungsphase; es vollzog sich der Übergang ins Hochmittelalter. Im Norden begann im 8. Jahrhundert die bis ins 11. Jahrhundert andauernde Wikingerzeit. In Osteuropa entstanden ab dem 7. Jahrhundert Herrschaftsgebiete der Slawen, teils auf Stammesbasis, teils in Form von Reichsbildungen., Byzanz konnte sich nach schweren Abwehrkämpfen behaupten und überwand auch den Bilderstreit im 8./9. Jahrhundert. Im 10./11. Jahrhundert stieg Byzanz wieder zur Großmacht im östlichen Mittelmeerraum auf. Dagegen wurde das arabische Kalifat wiederholt von inneren Kämpfen geschwächt. Die seit 661 herrschende Dynastie der Umayyaden wurde 750 von den Abbasiden gestürzt. Unter ihnen erlebte das Kalifat eine kulturelle Blüte, musste aber auch die Abspaltung von Teilgebieten hinnehmen. In Bezug auf staatliche Institutionen und die darauf beruhende Organisation komplexerer Aufgaben waren Byzanz und das Kalifat den schwächeren Monarchien im Westen lange Zeit überlegen. Ebenso war die dortige Wirtschaftskraft und vor allem das kulturelle Milieu ausgeprägter, zumal dort mehr vom antiken Kulturgut und der Wissenschaftstradition erhalten blieb., Im lateinischen Europa etablierte sich im Frühmittelalter eine neue Gesellschaftsordnung mit dem Adel und der hohen Geistlichkeit als den führenden Schichten. Eine wichtige Rolle spielte dabei die Grundherrschaft. Nach einer Phase des Niedergangs blühte die Kultur in Westeuropa im Zuge der karolingischen Bildungsreform im späten 8. und frühen 9. Jahrhundert spürbar auf, bevor es wieder zu einem zeitweiligen Rückgang kam. Bildung blieb ganz überwiegend auf die Geistlichkeit beschränkt. Wirtschaftlich begann nach einem Einbruch im 7./8. Jahrhundert wieder eine Phase des Aufschwungs, an dem die Städte Anteil hatten, wenngleich das Frühmittelalter wirtschaftlich überwiegend agrarisch geprägt war., Im religiösen Bereich wurde im Inneren Europas die Christianisierung der paganen Gebiete vorangetrieben. Dieser langsame Prozess zog sich teilweise bis ins Hochmittelalter hin, erweiterte den christlichen Kulturkreis aber erheblich nach Nord- und Osteuropa. Das zunächst politisch nicht relevante Papsttum und das Mönchtum gewannen zunehmend an Bedeutung. Die Kirche spielte im kulturellen Bereich ebenfalls eine wichtige Rolle. Mit dem Islam entstand zu Beginn des 7. Jahrhunderts eine neue große monotheistische Religion., Begriff und zeitliche Abgrenzung., Das Mittelalter wird oft mit dem Jahrtausend von etwa 600 bis etwa 1500 gleichgesetzt. Der Begriff bezieht sich in erster Linie auf Europa sowie den Mittelmeerraum als Kulturbereich und lässt sich daher nur bedingt auf die außereuropäische Geschichte anwenden, wenngleich in der historischen Forschung auch bezüglich der Kulturräume Indien, China und Japan spezifische historische Perioden als das jeweilige Mittelalter bezeichnet werden. Relevant ist der Begriff Mittelalter vor allem für den christlich-lateinisch geprägten Teil Europas, da es dort in der Spätantike zu einem politischen und kulturellen Einschnitt kam. Aber auch der byzantinisch-griechische und islamisch-arabische Raum sind für das Verständnis des Mittelalters wesentlich, da alle drei Räume in einer wechselseitigen Beziehung standen., Die Geschichtswissenschaft diskutiert noch immer darüber, wie man das Frühmittelalter zeitlich zur Spätantike und zum Hochmittelalter abgrenzt. Mit dem Ende der Antike und dem Anfang des Frühmittelalters setzte eine Zeit ein, die in der älteren Forschung oft als eher „dunkle Periode“ betrachtet wurde. Dies begann bereits mit dem Aufkommen des Begriffs „Mittelalter“ \\"(medium aevum)\\" im Humanismus und festigte sich endgültig mit dem Geschichtsmodell der Aufklärung im 18. Jahrhundert, in der diese Form der Periodisierung vorherrschend wurde und Geschichtsabläufe in einem bestimmten Sinne (einer „mittleren Zeit“ zwischen Antike und Neuzeit) gedeutet wurden. Damit wurde von vornherein eine gewollte Abwertung vorgenommen. Speziell das Frühmittelalter galt im Vergleich zur Antike und der Renaissance als „finstere Epoche“. Dieses Geschichtsbild war noch bis ins 20. Jahrhundert prägend. In der modernen Forschung wird jedoch auf die Problematik solch pauschaler Urteile hingewiesen und für eine differenziertere Betrachtung plädiert., Für den Beginn des Frühmittelalters sind aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven verschiedene Zeitpunkte und Ereignisse vorgeschlagen worden:, Die frühen Datierungen werden in der neueren Forschung nicht mehr vertreten. Vielmehr betrachtet man nun den Zeitraum von ca. 500 bis ca. 700 als fließende Übergangszeit von der Spätantike ins frühe Mittelalter mit Überschneidungen. Dabei wird berücksichtigt, dass dieser Prozess regional sehr unterschiedlich verlief und (unterschiedlich stark ausgeprägt) antike Elemente erhalten blieben. Oft wird von Frühmittelalterhistorikern auch die Entwicklung in der Spätantike ab dem 4. Jahrhundert in die Betrachtung einbezogen, soweit in dieser Phase wichtige Voraussetzungen für die spätere Entwicklung Westeuropas geschaffen wurden. Denn die Spätantike war eine Übergangszeit, die einzelne Wesenszüge des Mittelalters vorwegnahm, so insbesondere die Christianisierung von Staat und Gesellschaft. Während die ältere, am Klassizismus orientierte Forschung einen Bruch zwischen der als vorbildlich geltenden griechisch-römischen Antike und dem vermeintlich „finsteren“ Mittelalter betonte („Katastrophentheorie“), werden in der heutigen Forschung daher die Aspekte der Kontinuität herausgearbeitet und stärker gewichtet. Die Vielzahl von aktuellen Publikationen zeigt den deutlichen Anstieg des Forschungsinteresses an der Übergangszeit von der Spätantike ins Frühmittelalter, wobei die Forschungsansätze stark variieren., In der neueren Forschung wird das Geschehen im eurasischen Raum im ersten Jahrtausend – die Entstehung des spätrömischen Reiches mit all den damit verbundenen Umbrüchen, die „Völkerwanderung“, die Auseinandersetzungen mit Persien, die Entstehung der islamischen Welt und der romanisch-germanischen Welt im Westen des ehemaligen Imperiums – zunehmend im zeitlichen und räumlichen Zusammenhang betrachtet. In diesem Zusammenhang entstand ein als „\\"long Late Antiquity\\"“ bezeichnetes Modell der Zeit vom 3. bis 9. Jahrhundert, das von einer Minderheit in der Forschung vertreten wird. Unbestritten ist inzwischen, dass Spätantike und Frühmittelalter nicht als starre chronologische Gebilde begriffen werden dürfen und vielmehr regional unterschiedliche Übergangszeiträume zu berücksichtigen sind. In der neueren Forschung wird das frühmittelalterliche Europa verstärkt nicht mehr isoliert betrachtet, sondern ist eingebettet in einen globalgeschichtlichen Kontext., Auch das Ende des Frühmittelalters und der Beginn des Hochmittelalters wird an keinem einzelnen Datum festgemacht.

Diese Auseinandersetzungen begannen bereits in den Revolutionsmonaten. Sie dauerten in den Folgejahren an und gewannen durch Gerichtsverfahren zwischen einzelnen Fürstenhäusern und den jeweiligen Ländern des Deutschen Reiches an Intensität, da die Gerichte die Schadensersatzforderungen der Fürsten bestätigten. Höhepunkte des Konflikts waren das erfolgreiche Volksbegehren im März 1926 und der gescheiterte Volksentscheid zur entschädigungslosen Enteignung am 20. Juni 1926., Das Volksbegehren war von der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands (KPD) initiiert worden. Zögerlich schloss sich die Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) an. Nicht nur Wähler der KPD und der SPD befürworteten die entschädigungslose Enteignung. Auch viele Anhänger der Deutschen Zentrumspartei (Zentrum) und der Deutschen Demokratischen Partei (DDP) bejahten sie. In bestimmten Regionen Deutschlands unterstützten auch Wähler konservativ-nationaler Parteien diese Gesetzesinitiative. Man versprach sich von ihr die Verteilung von Grund und Boden an Bauern, Wohnraum, Unterstützung für Kriegsversehrte und andere soziale Maßnahmen., Adelsverbände, die Kirchen der zwei großen Konfessionen, großagrarische und industrielle Interessenverbände sowie die Parteien und Verbände des politisch rechten Lagers traten für die Fürsten ein. Sie trugen durch Boykottaufrufe schließlich zum Misserfolg des Volksentscheids bei., An die Stelle der entschädigungslosen Enteignung traten individuelle Abfindungsverträge. Sie regelten die Verteilung der Vermögensmassen zwischen den jeweiligen Ländern und den ehemals herrschenden Fürstenhäusern., In Politik- und Geschichtswissenschaft werden die Ereignisse unterschiedlich gedeutet. Während zum Beispiel die parteioffizielle Geschichtswissenschaft der DDR vor allem das Handeln der damaligen KPD positiv bewertete, machen bundesdeutsche Historiker auf die erheblichen Belastungen aufmerksam, die sich aus den plebiszitären Initiativen für die Zusammenarbeit der SPD mit den republikanischen Parteien des Bürgertums ergaben. Daneben wird auch auf die Generationenkonflikte hingewiesen, die sich in dieser politischen Auseinandersetzung zeigten. Gelegentlich gilt die Kampagne für die kompensationslose Enteignung als positives Beispiel direkter Demokratie., Historischer Kontext und Initiative., Entwicklung bis Ende 1925., Die Novemberrevolution beendete 1918 die Herrschaft der regierenden Fürstenhäuser in Deutschland. Diese sahen sich gezwungen abzudanken, taten dies angesichts der neuen politischen Gesamtsituation freiwillig oder wurden gegen ihren Willen entmachtet. Ihr Vermögen wurde beschlagnahmt, sie wurden jedoch – im Unterschied zur Situation in Deutschösterreich – nicht sofort enteignet., Auf Reichsebene fanden keine Beschlagnahmungen statt, denn es gab keinen entsprechenden Besitz. Darum verzichtete das Reich auf eine reichsweit einheitliche Regelung und überließ es den Ländern, wie diese die Konfiskationen jeweils regeln wollten. Überdies fürchtete der Rat der Volksbeauftragten, mit solchen Enteignungen Begehrlichkeiten der Siegermächte zu nähren, die auf enteignete, frühere fürstliche Vermögensmassen Reparationsansprüche hätten stellen können., Die Weimarer Verfassung von 1919 garantierte mit Artikel 153 einerseits das Eigentum. Andererseits hatte sie mit diesem Artikel die Möglichkeit eröffnet, Enteignungen vorzunehmen, wenn dies dem Allgemeinwohl diente. Eine solche Enteignung musste auf gesetzlicher Basis erfolgen und die Enteigneten waren „angemessen“ zu entschädigen, soweit nicht ein Reichsgesetz etwas anderes vorsah. Für Streitfragen sah Artikel 153 den Rechtsweg vor., Die Verhandlungen der einzelnen Länderregierungen mit den Fürstenhäusern zogen sich aufgrund unterschiedlicher Vorstellungen zur Entschädigungshöhe in die Länge. Auch rangen die Verhandlungsparteien oft um die Klärung der Frage, was den vormals regierenden Fürsten als Privateigentum zustand, im Unterschied zu solchen Besitztümern, auf die diese nur in ihrer Eigenschaft als Landesherren Zugriff gehabt hatten (Domänenfrage). Einige Fürstenhäuser forderten mit Blick auf Artikel 153 der Verfassung überdies die vollständige Herausgabe ihres früheren Eigentums sowie Ausgleichszahlungen für entgangene Vermögenserträge. Verkompliziert wurde die Lage durch die fortschreitende Geldentwertung im Zuge der Inflation in Deutschland, die den Wert von Entschädigungszahlungen minderte. Einzelne Fürstenhäuser fochten darum die Verträge an, die sie zuvor mit den Vertragspartnern auf Länderseite abgeschlossen hatten., Die volkswirtschaftliche Bedeutung der Streitobjekte war erheblich. Insbesondere hing die Existenz der kleinen Länder davon ab, ob es ihnen gelang, die wesentlichen Vermögensteile zu erstreiten. In Mecklenburg-Strelitz beispielsweise machten allein die umstrittenen Ländereien 55Prozent der Staatsfläche aus. In anderen kleineren Freistaaten lag dieser Anteil bei immerhin 20 bis 30Prozent. In Großstaaten wie Preußen oder Bayern war der Prozentanteil umstrittener Landflächen dagegen kaum von Bedeutung. Die absoluten Zahlen erreichten dort dennoch Dimensionen, die an die Größe von Herzogtümern anderswo heranreichen konnten. Die Forderungen, welche die Fürstenhäuser insgesamt an die einzelnen Länder stellten, addierten sich auf eine Summe von 2,6 Milliarden Mark., Bei gerichtlichen Auseinandersetzungen entschieden die überwiegend konservativ und monarchistisch eingestellten Richter wiederholt im Sinne der Fürstenhäuser. Für öffentlichen Unmut sorgte vor allem ein Urteil des Reichsgerichts vom 18. Juni 1925. Es hob ein Gesetz auf, das die von der USPD dominierte Landesversammlung von Sachsen-Gotha am 31. Juli 1919 zum Zweck der Einziehung des gesamten Domanialbesitzes der Herzöge von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha erlassen hatte. Dieses Landesgesetz war in den Augen der Richter nicht verfassungsgemäß. Sie sprachen dem Fürstenhaus den gesamten Land- und Forstbesitz wieder zu. Der Gesamtwert dieses richterlich zurückgeführten Vermögens belief sich auf 37,2 Millionen Goldmark. Oberhaupt des Fürstenhauses war damals Carl Eduard Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, ein erklärter Gegner der Republik., Auch Preußen verhandelte lange mit dem Haus Hohenzollern. Ein erster Einigungsversuch scheiterte 1920 am Widerstand der sozialdemokratischen Landtagsfraktion, einem zweiten widersprachen 1924 die Hohenzollern. Das preußische Finanzministerium legte am 12. Oktober 1925 einen neuen Vertragsentwurf vor, der in der Öffentlichkeit jedoch heftig kritisiert wurde, weil vorgesehen war, ca. drei Viertel des umstrittenen Grundbesitzes an das Fürstenhaus zurückzugeben. Gegen diesen Vergleich stemmte sich nicht nur die SPD, sondern auch die DDP, die sich damit gegen ihren eigenen Finanzminister Hermann Höpker-Aschoff wandte. In dieser Situation legte die DDP dem Reichstag am 23. November 1925 einen Gesetzentwurf vor. Dieser sollte die Länder ermächtigen, in den Auseinandersetzungen mit den ehemaligen Fürstenhäusern Landesgesetze zur Regelung der Vermögensstreitigkeiten zu verabschieden. Der Rechtsweg gegen die Inhalte dieser Landesgesetze sollte ausdrücklich ausgeschlossen werden. Die SPD hatte gegen diesen Gesetzentwurf der DDP nur wenige Einwände, hatte sie doch selbst 1923 einen ganz ähnlichen Gesetzentwurf entwickelt., Initiative für ein Volksbegehren., Zwei Tage später, am 25. November 1925, initiierte die KPD ebenfalls einen Gesetzentwurf. Dieser sah keinen Interessenausgleich zwischen den Ländern und den Fürstenhäusern vor, sondern eine entschädigungslose Enteignung. Die Ländereien sollten an Bauern und Pächter übergehen, Schlösser sollten zu Genesungsheimen umfunktioniert werden oder zur Linderung der Wohnungsnot dienen, das Barvermögen sollte schließlich Kriegsbeschädigten und Hinterbliebenen zukommen., Der Adressat dieses Gesetzentwurfs war weniger der Reichstag, wo ein solcher Antrag kaum die notwendige Mehrheit finden würde, sondern das Volk. Es sollte auf dem Weg eines Volksbegehrens seinen Willen zu einer radikalen Veränderung der Eigentumsverhältnisse zum Ausdruck bringen – zunächst bezogen auf den beschlagnahmten Fürstenbesitz., Den Kommunisten war bewusst, dass eine solche Gesetzesinitiative in einer Zeit attraktiv war, in der die Arbeitslosenzahlen stiegen, bedingt vor allem durch den deutlichen Konjunktureinbruch seit November 1925 und auch durch die so genannte Rationalisierungskrise. Außerdem war die Hyperinflation in frischer Erinnerung. Sie hatte gezeigt, welchen besonderen Wert immobile Vermögenswerte haben konnten, die hier zur Verteilung anstanden. Ganz im Sinne einer Einheitsfrontpolitik zielte die KPD-Initiative darauf ab, verloren gegangene Wähler zurückzugewinnen und möglicherweise auch Angehörige der Mittelschichten anzusprechen, die zu den Inflationsverlierern gehörten. Als Ausdruck einer solchen Strategie lud die KPD am 2. Dezember 1925 die SPD, den Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbund (ADGB), den AfA-Bund, den Deutschen Beamten-Bund, das Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold und den Roten Frontkämpferbund ein, gemeinsam ein Volksbegehren auf den Weg zu bringen., Zunächst reagierte die SPD ablehnend. Das Bestreben der KPD, einen Keil zwischen die sozialdemokratischen „Massen“ und die als „Bonzen“ titulierten SPD-Führungskräfte zu treiben, erschien ihr allzu offensichtlich. Auch vor der parlamentskritischen Färbung eines Volksbegehrens und -entscheids wurde gewarnt. Ferner erblickte die Führung der SPD noch Möglichkeiten, die Streitfragen parlamentarisch zu lösen. Ein weiterer Grund für Reserven gegenüber der plebiszitären Initiative war ihre drohende Erfolglosigkeit. Es mussten mehr als die Hälfte aller Stimmberechtigten in Deutschland, also fast 20 Millionen Wähler, einem entsprechenden Volksentscheid zustimmen, sofern das in Frage stehende Gesetz verfassungsändernd war. KPD und SPD erreichten in der vorangegangenen Reichstagswahl vom 7. Dezember 1924 allerdings nur ca. 10,6 Millionen Stimmen., Nach dem Jahreswechsel 1925/26 drehte sich die Stimmung innerhalb der SPD. Gespräche über die Aufnahme von Sozialdemokraten in die Reichsregierung scheiterten im Januar endgültig, sodass sich die SPD von nun an wieder stärker auf Oppositionspolitik konzentrieren: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Fürstenenteignung, Novemberrevolution, Enteignung, Volksbegehren, Volksentscheid, politische Parteien, rechtliche Auseinandersetzungen, individuelle Abfindungsverträge, direkte Demokratie, politische Konflikte"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Aufgelöst 1803, Bayerischer Reichskreis, Ehemaliges Augustiner-Chorherren-Stift in Bayern, Ersterwähnung 1102, Fürstentum in Bayern, Fürstpropstei Berchtesgaden, Geistliches Reichsfürstentum, Geschichte (Landkreis Berchtesgadener Land), Reichsabtei], Das erstmals im Jahr 1102 urkundlich erwähnte Klosterstift Berchtesgaden \\"(berthercatmen)\\" im äußersten Südosten des heutigen Bayern wurde 1380 als \\"Zepterlehen\\" zur Reichsprälatur Berchtesgaden und schließlich 1559 zur Fürstpropstei Berchtesgaden erhoben. Schon die Stiftspröpste des alten Augustiner-Chorherren-Stiftes hatten ab 1194 geistliche und weltliche Macht inne. Ab 1380 waren sie als Reichsprälaten im Reichstag mit Sitz und Stimme vertreten. Als Fürstpropstei bildete das Land Berchtesgaden bzw. \\"Berchtesgadener Land\\" bis 1803 ein eigenständiges, reichsunmittelbares Fürstentum. Die Residenz der Stifts- und Fürstpröpste war das mit den Jahren erweiterte Klosterstiftsgebäude im Haupt- und Ursprungsort Berchtesgaden., Die Landesherrschaft wurde vom Propst ausgeübt, daneben hatten auch die Chorherren großen Einfluss. Dem Stift wurde 1156 die Forsthoheit und damit verbunden auch die Schürffreiheit auf Salz und Metall gewährt. Während die heimische Land- und Viehwirtschaft bis zuletzt nur wenig ertragreich blieb, sorgten Salz- und Metallgewinnung für wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung und Arbeitsplätze, die einem Teil der „Nebenerwerbsbauern“ das Auskommen sicherte. Das Salz bildete allerdings auch Anlass für politische Ränke und sogar kriegerische Auseinandersetzungen. So versuchte insbesondere das sein Kerngebiet nahezu vollkommen umschließende Erzstift Salzburg die Unabhängigkeit des Klosterstifts stets aufs Neue einzuschränken., Eine weitere Einnahmequelle für die Berchtesgadener Bevölkerung bildete seit Ende des 15.Jahrhunderts die Berchtesgadener War, das als Holzspielzeug nach dem Vorbild Ammergaus bald den Weg in „die fernsten Theile der handelnden Welt gefunden“ hatte. Demgegenüber stand der seit Ende des 14.Jahrhunderts immer wieder kritisierte luxuriöse und „unwürdige“ Lebenswandel der Augustiner-Chorherren, der zu großen Schuldenlasten und damit zu jahrzehntelangen Verpfändungen stiftseigener Salinen führte., Gebiet., Geschlossener Waldbezirk als Kerngebiet., Seit dem 10.Jahrhundert als Bannwald der Sieghardinger Grafen erstmals grundherrschaftlich erfasst, war das von Irmgard von Sulzbach kurz vor ihrem Tod (†1101) für ein Klosterstift ausersehene Gebiet nur sehr dünn besiedelt. Die nach erster Ehe mit einem Sieghardinger verwitwete Irmgard hatte diesen von ihm ererbten Besitz in die Ehe mit GebhardII. von Sulzbach (†1085) als Morgengabe eingebracht., Bereits in seinen Anfängen um 1101 wurde das Klosterstift und dessen erster Propst Eberwin von Irmgards Sohn Graf BerengarI. mit dem in sich geschlossenen Land um Berchtesgaden sowie u.a. den Besitzungen in Niederheim im Pinzgau ausgestattet. 1125 gab BerengarI. auch noch \\"„omnem silvam ad locum Grauingaden dictum pertinentem“\\", d.h. das vollständige Waldgebiet des seinerzeit noch \\"Grafengaden\\" genannten Ortes St.Leonhard bei Grödig dazu. Die Grenze dieses Waldes wurde wie folgt von den Historikern festgestellt: Sie führte über den \\"Diezzenbach\\" (Dießbach; vermutlich benannt nach derer von Dießen mit Sitz in Reichenhall) der \\"Sala\\" (Saalach) entlang zum Dorf \\"Waliwes\\" (Wals), dann zum Sumpfland \\"Uilzmos\\" (Viehausermoos) und nach \\"Anava\\" (Anif), von da Salzach aufwärts zum oberen \\"Scrainpach\\" (Schrainbach) weiter zum \\"Farmignekke\\" (Fahreneck?) und zur \\"Swalwen\\" (Ecker Sattel?), dann hinauf zum \\"Gelichen\\" (Hoher Göll), zum Ursprung des \\"Cuonispach\\" (Königsbach), weiter \\"Ouzinsperch\\" und \\"Pochisrukke\\" (Grat am Schneibstein?), zum See am \\"Phafinsperch\\" (Seeleinsee), durch das Langtal zur \\"Viscuncula\\" (Fischunkel) hinab; damit lag vieles auf dem Gebiet des Erzstifts Salzburg, so dass Auseinandersetzungen vorprogrammiert waren., Am 8.Mai 1155 kam es zu einem Gütertausch zwischen Erzbischof EberhardI. von Salzburg und Propst HeinrichI.; für einen Hof in Landersdorf bei Wölbling erweiterte sich das Gebiet des Klosterstifts um das „pratum Bisvolfeswisen“ (Bischofswiesen)., Das Kerngebiet des \\"Landes Berchtesgaden\\" umfasste damit den „geschlossenen ursprünglichen Waldbezirk“ innerhalb des Berchtesgadener Talkessels. Darüber hinaus war das Klosterstift mit „größeren und kleineren Herrschaften“ in Grödig, Reichenhall, am Schönberg und im Gebirge durch die „Grafen von Rot, Wasserburg und Plaien“ sowie aus „dem Hause Andechs und Dießen“ ausgestattet. Bis zum 13.Jahrhundert kamen weitere Liegenschaften wie Weinberge, Mühlen und Landgüter hinzu, unter anderem in Niederbayern, im nördlichen Oberbayern, in der Oberpfalz, in Mittelfranken, Schwaben und Österreich, dazu Residenzen („Höfe“) in Salzburg, München, Regensburg und Klosterneuburg., Das Klosterstift war wenige Jahre nach seiner Gründung bereits „Herr über den gesamten Grund und Boden“ jenes genau begrenzten Gebietes, das in etwa dem der späteren Fürstpropstei entsprach. Als dessen Besitzer war es zugleich auch allein zuständig für die Rodungen und die Besiedlung der gerodeten Freiflächen, woran sich im 12. und 13.Jahrhundert die kaiserlichen Regalien und die Gerichtszuständigkeiten knüpften – nach Dieter Albrecht „eine zentrale Voraussetzung“ der späteren Landeshoheit „im Berchtesgadener Land“., Gnotschaften., Um die Hauptorte des Berchtesgadener Kernlandes, den zentralen Markt Berchtesgaden und den Markt Schellenberg, gruppierten sich vermutlich schon kurz nach Propst Ulrich Wulps \\"Landbrief\\" von 1377 die acht \\"Urgnotschaften\\" Au, Salzberg, Bischofswiesen, Ettenberg, Gern, Ramsau, Scheffau und Schönau, die im ersten Steuerbuch des Berchtesgadener Landes von 1456 namentlich beurkundet sind. Diese waren in eine variierende Anzahl von \\"Gnotschaftsbezirken\\" unterteilt, in denen sich die dort lebenden Bauern jeweils für ein oder zwei Jahre einen \\"Gnotschafter\\" (andere Schreibweise \\"Gnotschäfter\\") wählten. 1802, ein Jahr vor der Säkularisation, waren die acht Gnotschaften in 32 \\"Gnotschafterbezirke\\" unterteilt., Herrschaftsbereiche als Fürstpropstei., Das 1559 zur Fürstpropstei erhobene \\"Berchtesgadener Land\\" war als einziges und kleinstes Fürstentum innerhalb des Bayerischen Reichskreises mit eigener Virilstimme vertreten. Einige Besitzungen mussten wegen der stetig steigenden Schulden zum Teil verpfändet oder verkauft werden oder wurden im Rahmen eines Interessenausgleichs getauscht., So zählten am Ende des 16.Jahrhunderts neben dem Kernland beziehungsweise dem „geschlossenen Bezirk“ mit seinen Gnotschaften noch Besitztümer in folgenden Regionen zum Einfluss- und Herrschaftsbereich der Fürstpropstei:, Geschichte., Frühgeschichte, Namensgebung und Ersterwähnung., Zur Früh- beziehungsweise Vorgeschichte der Region um Berchtesgaden existieren lediglich Streufunde (vorwiegend Lochäxte) aus der Jungsteinzeit, die den Aufenthalt von Fischern und Jägern vor 4000 Jahren belegen. Ein Münzfund aus der Latènezeit (5. bis 1.Jahrhundert v.Chr.) könnte auch durch Verschleppung erklärt werden, da bislang keine Siedlungsreste aus dieser Zeit nachgewiesen werden konnten., Im Frühmittelalter gehörte das Gebiet des Berchtesgadener Landes zum baierischen Stammesherzogtum. Dem ersten Bischof von Salzburg und „Apostel Bayerns“ Rupert schenkte Herzog TheodoII. im Jahr 700 die Almen \\"Gauzo (Götschen)\\" und \\"Ladusa (Larosbach)\\" im heutigen Marktschellenberg. Der einstige Salzburggau war in mehrere Grafschaften unterteilt, von denen eine \\"Grafengaden\\" war. Zu ihr gehörte das Berchtesgadener Waldgebiet, in dem im 10. und 11.Jahrhundert das edelfreie Geschlecht der Aribonen lebte., Der erste Teil des Namens könnte sich entweder von der Perchta oder einem Siedler mit dem Namen \\"Perther\\" ableiten, der zweite Teil von \\"Gaden\\", einem umzäunten Wohnsitz. Nach Helm und Feulner könnte dieser \\"Perther\\" auch ein Aribone gewesen sein, der dort ein einstöckiges Haus beziehungsweise eine Jagdhütte unterhielt, in deren Nähe auch einige Hütten für Dienstleute standen. Ab Ende des 12. Jahrhunderts ist in den Urkunden häufig von \\"„berhtersgaden“\\" die Rede. Eine andere Quelle nennt die Schreibweisen \\"„Berchtersgadmen“\\" für 1106 (im Gegensatz zur fehlerhaften Schreibweise \\"„Berthercatmen“\\" einer päpstlichen Kanzlei), für 1121 \\"„Perehtgeresgadem“\\"; weitere Schreibweisen im 12. Jahrhundert seien \\"„Perhtersgadem“\\", \\"„Perthersgadem“\\" und \\"„Berhtersgadem“\\" gewesen. In der 1456 gefertigten Kopie einer Urkunde von 1266 ist zum ersten Mal die heutige Schreibweise „Berchtesgaden“ enthalten. Spätestens ab dem 18. Jahrhundert ist (auch) von \\"Brechtolsgaden\\" die Rede, in \\"Historische abhandlungen der königlich-baierischen Akademie\\" aus dem Jahr 1807 vom „vormaligen Stift Bertholdsgaden“. Und in Herders Conversations-Lexikon von 1854 gibt es, korrespondierend mit einer Berchtesgadener Sage, die alternierenden Stichwörter „Berchtesgaden“ und „Berchtoldsgaden“., Erstmals urkundlich erwähnt wurde Berchtesgaden im Jahre 1102.

Insgesamt 16 deutsche Meisterschaften und elf Titel im DFB-Pokal wurden durch Mannschaften aus dem Ruhrgebiet gewonnen. 1937 wurde der FC Schalke 04 erster Double-Sieger in Deutschland, Borussia Dortmund konnte 1966 als erster deutscher Verein einen Europapokal gewinnen und im Jahr 1997 gewann Dortmund die Champions League und der FC Schalke 04 den UEFA-Pokal. Insgesamt spielten in der Bundesliga bislang sieben Vereine aus dem Ruhrgebiet, aktuell (2022/23) spielen mit Schalke, Dortmund und dem VfL Bochum drei Vereine in der höchsten Spielklasse. Insbesondere Borussia Dortmund und der FC Schalke 04 nehmen eine bedeutende Rolle im deutschen Fußball ein und sind auch überregional populär., Geschichte des Ruhrgebietsfußballs., \\"Übersichtskarte des Ruhrgebiets; aufgeführt sind alle Städte mit mehr als 50.000 Einwohnern\\", Entstehung der ersten Fußballvereine im Revier., Als erster reiner Fußballverein des Ruhrgebiets (und fünftältester Deutschlands) gründete sich 1892 der Wittener Fußballclub. Wie in vielen anderen Städten des Landes und entgegen dem verbreiteten Klischee waren die ersten aktiven Fußballer des Reviers jedoch keine Arbeiter, sondern Schüler aus der Oberschicht, die den in den Jahren zuvor aus England „importierten“ und zunächst nur an den Gymnasien und Realgymnasien Westdeutschlands populär gewordenen Sport nun auch in ihrer Freizeit gemeinsam ausübten., Wie und wann genau der Fußball seinen Weg in den Sportunterricht an deutschen Schulen fand, lässt sich nur schwer rekonstruieren. Zwar waren in England schon um 1845 die ersten Vorläufer von Fußball und Rugby entstanden, in Deutschland wurde bis in die 1870er Jahre (und auch danach) an den Lehranstalten jedoch vor allem geturnt. Dennoch wurde Fußball in den 1860ern auf dem Kontinent durch englische Emigranten bekannt, deren Kinder in ihren Schulen und Pensionaten den Sport ausübten und ihre deutschen Freunde zum Mitspielen aufforderten. Nachdem 1872 das Braunschweiger Gymnasium als erste deutsche Schule freiwillige Ballspiele anbot, breitete sich der Fußball sukzessive im Land aus und wurde vielerorts in den Unterricht integriert., Parallel zu den reinen Fußballvereinen, die sich verbreitet nach Wittener Vorbild als Organisationen von Oberschülern gründeten, entstanden in den 1890ern auch viele Fußballabteilungen in den Turnvereinen der Region. Auch der erste bedeutende Verein des Ruhrgebiets, der Duisburger SpV, war ursprünglich als Spielabteilung des Duisburger Turnvereins von 1848 entstanden und hatte sich erst 1900, acht Jahre nach Gründung der Abteilung, vom Stammverein getrennt., In den ersten Jahren der Ausübung des Sports in Vereinen existierten noch keine verbindlichen Regeln, weder zur Durchführung des Spiels selbst noch in Hinblick auf Vereinswettbewerbe. Als erster Verband in Westdeutschland entstand dann im September 1898 der Rheinische Spielverband, der zunächst nur aus neun Gründungsmitgliedern bestand, sich jedoch schnell zum einflussreichsten Verband der Region entwickelte und bereits zwei Jahre später als Rheinisch-Westfälischer Spielverband (ab 1907 dann: Westdeutscher Spielverband, kurz WSV) für den gesamten westdeutschen Raum zuständig war. Regelmäßige Meisterschaftsrunden in Westdeutschland wurden ab 1902 ausgespielt, zunächst in drei Bezirken mit jeweils drei Leistungsklassen., Bereits drei Jahre später waren so viele neue Vereine dem Verband beigetreten, dass eine Neueinteilung der Bezirke nötig wurde. Das Ruhrgebiet wurde erstmals geteilt, der westliche Teil (zum Rheinland gehörig) wurde dem Bezirk Ruhr, der westfälische Teil im Osten dem Bezirk Mark zugeordnet. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass anfangs mehrere erste Ligen im Verbandsgebiet existierten und die stärksten Mannschaften der Region nur noch in Endrunden oder Pokalspielen gegeneinander antraten. Aus diesem Grund wurde 1909 die Einrichtung einer „Ligaklasse“ beschlossen, in der die zehn besten Vereine der Bezirke die Westdeutsche Meisterschaft ausspielen sollten; entsprechend der Leistungsstärke der Mannschaften zur damaligen Zeit entstammten alle Mannschaften dem Rheinland, in der Gründungssaison waren neben dem Duisburger SV nur noch Preußen Duisburg und der Essener Turnerbund aus dem Ruhrgebiet vertreten. Trotz dieser Bündelung der Kräfte erreichte in den Jahren vor dem Krieg nur der Duisburger SV ein Endspiel um die deutsche Meisterschaft, in dem man 1913 dem VfB Leipzig mit 1:3 unterlag., Dennoch entwickelte sich der Fußball auch im Ruhrgebiet rasant. Bereits 1914 gehörten dem Westdeutschen Verband 603 Vereine an, von denen ein gutes Drittel aus dem Revier stammte. Allerdings setzte sich zunächst die Tradition fort, dass die Aktiven überwiegend aus der Mittel- und Oberschicht stammten und sich nur sehr vereinzelt Vereine aus dem direkten Umfeld des Arbeitermilieus gründeten. Die Ursachen hierfür sind vielfältiger Natur, liegen aber vor allem in der neu definierten Rolle des Sports im Bürgertum. Während sich das Turnen spätestens seit der Gründung des Kaiserreichs zum Sport der Konservativen entwickelt hatte, übte der progressive Teil des Bürgertums um die Jahrhundertwende eher englisch geprägte Sportarten wie Fußball, Tennis oder Rudern aus. Zudem hatte die Arbeitszeitverkürzung für Angestellte aus dem Jahr 1891 den arbeitsfreien Sonntag zur Folge, an dem Zeit für soziales Leben insbesondere auch im Sport war. Jedoch spitzte sich der Konflikt zwischen Turnern und Fußballern in den Jahren vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg zu, Lehrer und Behörden setzten vielfach Verbote des Spiels durch., Der Fußball konnte sich letztlich dennoch ausbreiten, nicht zuletzt dank guter Verbindungen seiner Offiziellen zum Militär. Vielfach wurde in der Armee Fußball zur körperlichen Ertüchtigung gespielt, zudem hatten sich der Deutsche Fußball-Bund nebst seinen Landesverbänden bereits früh als Kriegsbefürworter bekannt. So ruhten während des Kriegs zwar die Meisterschaftsrunden, jedoch hatte der DFB einen Kriegspokal ausgelobt, um den die wenigen Sportler, die nicht eingezogen wurden, spielten. Gleichzeitig wurden in der Armee selbst Regiments- und Kompaniemeisterschaften ausgetragen, die zur weiteren Popularisierung dieses Sports beitrugen., Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg – Fußball wird zum Sport der Massen., Politisch wie sozial waren die Arbeiter in den Zechen und Industrieanlagen zur Zeit des Kaiserreichs weitgehend isoliert. Die neu errichteten Wohngebiete für das Industrieproletariat entstanden außerhalb der Innenstädte des Ruhrgebiets, die von Angestellten und Gewerbetreibenden dominiert wurden. Entsprechend wenige Kontakte entstanden demnach zwischen dem Bürgertum und der Arbeiterschicht; zudem blieben die Einwanderer aus Ostpreußen und Polen vorwiegend unter sich und siedelten sich vornehmlich dort an, wo bereits große Gruppen von ihnen lebten., Unter diesen Rahmenbedingungen konnte sich das Proletariat nur zögernd für den Fußball begeistern. Erst nach der Jahrhundertwende, also gut zehn Jahre nach der Gründung des ersten Fußballvereins der Oberschicht, begann die Zeit des Arbeiterfußballs – zunächst in Form von Straßenmannschaften und Unterabteilungen kirchlicher Jünglingsvereine, die im Umfeld der Arbeitersiedlungen rund um die Zechen des Reviers beheimatet waren. Beeinflusst wurden die zumeist jungen Aktiven vom Treiben auf den Sportplätzen, auf denen nach Gründung des Spielverbands 1902 nun auch regelmäßig Meisterschaftsspiele stattfanden., Begünstigt wurde die wachsende Zahl aktiver Fußballer in der Arbeiterklasse durch die Vorteile, die der Fußball gegenüber anderen prominenten Sportarten der Zeit besaß. Nicht nur hielt sich der finanzielle Aufwand für das unorganisierte „Pöhlen“ in Grenzen, auch besaßen viele Arbeiter die notwendigen Fähigkeiten zur Ausübung des Sports, der gleichermaßen körperliche Durchsetzungsfähigkeit wie Kooperationsbereitschaft benötigt. Dennoch war es bis in die Zeit der Weimarer Republik hinein für viele Arbeiter unmöglich, einem „echten“ Fußballverein beizutreten – die Preise für Trikots und Fußballschuhe übertrafen den Lohn für eine Schicht um ein Vielfaches. Und in den nicht seltenen Fällen, wo sich, zumeist unter finanzieller Unterstützung von Gastwirten, Arbeitervereine gründeten und um Eintritt in den WSV baten, wurde ihnen dieser verwehrt– häufig aus politischen Gründen, mitunter jedoch auch zur Sicherung des Spielbetriebs, da viele Vereine nur für wenige Monate existierten., Mit der neuen Rolle der Arbeiterschicht im Zuge der Novemberrevolution von 1918 beschleunigte sich der Aufstieg des Fußballs zum Volkssport dann noch einmal massiv. Nicht nur erhielten die arbeitenden Massen politische Freiheiten, sie profitierten auch von den sozialen Errungenschaften der Zeit; insbesondere die Einführung freier Wochenenden auch für Arbeitskräfte in der Industrie ließ den Sport zu einem Vergnügen für die gesamte Bevölkerung werden. Bis in die 1930er Jahre verzeichnete der DFB einen Anstieg seiner Mitgliederzahlen von 161.000 aus dem Jahr 1913 hin zu über einer Million Mitglieder, zudem gründeten sich die Deutsche Jugendkraft als katholischer Sportverband und vielerorts wurden Werksmannschaften eingerichtet., Neben einer Explosion der Aktivenzahlen begann in den 1920ern auch der große Erfolg des Fußballs als Publikumssport. Dadurch, dass viele der Spitzenvereine noch eng in ihrem lokalen Milieu verankert waren, konnten sich die Zuschauer leicht mit „ihrem“ Verein identifizieren. Als Konsequenz schnellten die Zuschauerzahlen in die Höhe, neue Stadien wie das Wedaustadion in Duisburg oder das Essener Stadion am Uhlenkrug wurden gebaut. Zudem entdeckte die Presse den Sport; die ersten Fußballzeitschriften entstanden, und 1926 wurde mit der Partie Schwarz-Weiß Essens gegen den VfL Osnabrück eine der ersten Fußballbegegnungen im Radio übertragen., Sportlich gehörten die Mannschaften des Ruhrgebiets zwischen 1918 und 1930 noch nicht zur absoluten Leistungsspitze in Deutschland. Zwar konnte die DJK Katernberg zweimal (1921 und 1924) die DJK-Meisterschaft erringen, unter dem Dach des DFB reichte es jedoch für keinen der Vereine des Reviers zum großen Triumph. Regional dominierten bis zum Ende des Jahrzehnts vor allem die Vereine, die auch in der wilhelminischen Zeit führend waren, der Duisburger Spielverein und der Essener Turnerbund/Schwarz-Weiß Essen; ab 1926, als der BV Altenessen 06 Ruhrbezirksmeister werden konnte, liefen ihnen jedoch viele der Arbeiterclubs sportlich den Rang ab. Besonders der FC Schalke 04 dominierte ab 1928 den Fußball im Revier und schwang sich: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Fußball Nordrhein-Westfalen, Sport Ruhrgebiet, Meisterschaften, DFB-Pokal, FC Schalke 04, Borussia Dortmund, Champions League, UEFA-Pokal, Geschichte des Ruhrgebietsfußballs, Fußballvereine, Westdeutscher Spielverband"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Fußball-Europameisterschaft, Fußball-Europameisterschaft 2004, Fußballveranstaltung 2004, Sportveranstaltung in Portugal], Die Endrunde der 12.

Am Turnier nahmen 16 Nationalmannschaften teil, die in 31 Spielen zunächst in Gruppen und danach im K.-o.-System gegeneinander antraten., Die Nationalmannschaft Griechenlands, die als Außenseiter angereist war, gewann das Turnier nach einem 1:0-Sieg über Portugal im Finale von Lissabon und wurde damit zum ersten Mal Fußball-Europameister. Mit dem Mittelfeldspieler Theodoros Zagorakis stellte Griechenland zudem den besten Spieler des Turniers. Der Vize-Weltmeister von 2002, Deutschland, scheiterte, wie auch vier Jahre zuvor, bereits in der Gruppenphase. Die Schweiz scheiterte ebenso in der Gruppenphase, Österreich bereits in der Qualifikation. Torschützenkönig wurde der Tscheche Milan Baroš., Vergabe., Portugal bekam die Austragung der Europameisterschaft 2004 am 12. Oktober 1999 in Aachen von der UEFA zugesprochen. Das Land setzte sich dabei unter anderem gegen Spanien und Österreich/Ungarn durch. Portugal hatte Spanien die gemeinsame Austragung des Turniers angeboten, die Spanier lehnten jedoch in der Hoffnung auf den Zuschlag für eine eigenständige Ausrichtung ab., Reglement., Turnierform., Wie schon bei den letzten beiden Europameisterschaften zuvor wurde auch diesmal die Vorrunde in vier Gruppen zu vier Mannschaften bestritten. Die jeweils ersten beiden Mannschaften jeder Gruppe qualifizierten sich für das Viertelfinale., Silver Goal., Das einzige Mal bei einer Fußball-Europameisterschaft galt ab Viertelfinale die Silver-Goal-Regel: Sollte es in einem Spiel der Finalrunde nach der regulären Spielzeit unentschieden stehen, würden zunächst 15 Minuten nachgespielt. Nur bei einem erneuten Unentschieden käme es zu einer weiteren 15-minütigen Verlängerung. Danach würde ein Elfmeterschießen ausgetragen., Das einzige Spiel, in dem ein Silver Goal erzielt wurde, war das Halbfinale zwischen Griechenland und Tschechien, welches die Griechen gewannen., Entscheidungskriterien für die Gruppenphase., Die Platzierung der Mannschaften in den Vorrundengruppen ergab sich nach den folgenden Kriterien in folgender Reihenfolge:, Falls sich am letzten Spieltag der Gruppenphase zwei Mannschaften gegenübergestanden hätten, die nach Ende der regulären Spielzeit Remis spielten und dieselbe Anzahl an Punkten und dieselbe Tordifferenz aufwiesen und es kein weiteres Team gegeben hätte, das ebenso viele Punkte verbuchen konnte, wäre die Entscheidung um die Platzierung in der Gruppe im Elfmeterschießen gefallen., Teilnehmer., Die Qualifikationsrunde für die Europameisterschaft 2004 fand von September 2002 bis Oktober 2003 in zehn Gruppen statt, in denen jeweils fünf Mannschaften spielten. Portugal war als Gastgeber automatisch qualifiziert. Die zehn Gruppensieger qualifizierten sich automatisch für die Endrunde. Unter den zehn Gruppenzweiten wurden fünf Relegationsspiele ausgetragen, deren fünf Sieger ebenfalls die Endrunde erreichten., Auslosung der Endrunde., Bei der Auslosung für die Europameisterschaftsendrunde am 29. November 2003 in Lissabon wurden die 16 Mannschaften entsprechend ihren Ergebnissen bei den Qualifikationen für die WM 2002 und die EM 2004 in vier Lostöpfe eingeteilt. Mannschaften aus den gleichen Lostöpfen konnten in den Gruppenspielen nicht aufeinandertreffen. Lostopf A bestand aus Frankreich (als Europameister 2000 als Gruppenkopf gesetzt), Portugal (als Gruppenkopf in Gruppe A gesetzt) Schweden und Tschechien. In Topf B fanden sich England, Spanien, Italien und Deutschland wieder. In Lostopf C befanden sich die Niederlande, Kroatien, Dänemark und Russland und in Lostopf D Bulgarien, Schweiz, Griechenland und Lettland. Die Auslosung ergab folgende Gruppeneinteilung:, Vorrunde., Gruppe A., Der Gastgeber Portugal startete mit einer Niederlage gegen Griechenland ins Turnier, wodurch die Mannschaft von Luiz Felipe Scolari früh unter Druck geraten war. Nach dem Sieg gegen Russland musste Spanien besiegt werden, was im letzten Gruppenspiel gelang., Griechenland gewann das Eröffnungsspiel gegen den Gastgeber Portugal, worauf im zweiten Spiel ein Unentschieden gegen Spanien folgte. Nach der Niederlage gegen das bereits ausgeschiedene Russland, die knapp zum Viertelfinaleinzug reichte, ging die Fachwelt davon aus, dass gegen Europameister Frankreich das Turnieraus kommen würde., Spanien begann das Turnier mit einem Sieg gegen Russland. Nach dem Unentschieden gegen Griechenland hätte ein Unentschieden gegen Portugal zum Weiterkommen genügt. Die 0:1-Niederlage gegen den Nachbarn führte zum Aus, weil Griechenland nicht mit mehr als einem Tor Unterschied gegen Russland verlor. Somit hatte Spanien gegenüber Griechenland bei gleichem Torverhältnis weniger Tore erzielt., Russland verlor die ersten beiden Spiele gegen Spanien und Portugal. Dies führte dazu, dass der Sieg gegen Griechenland im letzten Gruppenspiel nicht zum Einzug ins Viertelfinale reichte., Im Spiel Russland gegen Griechenland wurde von dem russischen Spieler Dmitri Kiritschenko der Rekord für das am schnellsten erzielte Tor bei einer EM aufgestellt. Er traf 67 Sekunden nach dem Anpfiff., Gruppe B., Frankreich gelang ein später Auftaktsieg gegen England, dem ein Unentschieden gegen Kroatien folgte. Im letzten Spiel gegen die Schweiz stellte Frankreich durch ein Tor von Zidane und einen Doppelpack von Henry den Einzug in die Viertelfinals sicher., England verlor das erste Gruppenspiel gegen Frankreich, bei dem David Beckham seinen ersten Elfmeter bei dieser EM verschossen hatte. Frankreich drehte die Partie in der Nachspielzeit durch ein Freistoß- und ein Elfmetertor von Zinédine Zidane zum Endstand von 2:1. England hatte bis zur 91. Minute mit 1:0 geführt. Ein Sieg gegen die Schweiz und ein nach 0:1-Rückstand am Ende deutlicher Sieg gegen Kroatien ermöglichte das Weiterkommen. Der 18-jährige Wayne Rooney erzielte gegen die Schweiz und Kroatien jeweils zwei Tore und trug so zur Viertelfinal-Qualifikation der Engländer bei., Kroatien war nach dem ersten Gruppenspiel gegen die Schweiz, das mit einem torlosen Unentschieden geendet hatte, in Rücklage geraten. Kroatien erzielte mit dem 2:2 gegen Frankreich einen Achtungserfolg, schied nach dem 2:4 im letzten Gruppenspiel gegen England jedoch aus., Die Schweiz ging als Außenseiter in die Gruppe B und hatte nach dem Unentschieden gegen Kroatien keine großen Chancen mehr auf das Weiterkommen. Nach Niederlagen gegen England und Frankreich schied die Mannschaft aus., Johan Vonlanthen wurde durch seinen zwischenzeitlichen Ausgleichstreffer für die Schweiz zum jüngsten Torschützen der EM-Geschichte., Gruppe C., Schweden startete mit dem 5:0 gegen Bulgarien in das Turnier. Der in die schwedische Nationalelf zurückgekehrte Henrik Larsson, der unter anderem ein Tor durch einen Flugkopfball erzielte, sowie Zlatan Ibrahimović mit einem Elfmetertor waren die besten Spieler des mit der höchsten Tordifferenz im Turnier gewonnenen Spiels. Das 1:1-Unentschieden gegen Italien und das 2:2 gegen Dänemark reichten zum Weiterkommen als Gruppenerster., Dänemark startete mit einem 0:0 gegen Italien ins Turnier. Der folgende Sieg gegen Bulgarien sorgte dafür, dass Schweden und Dänemark ein 2:2 im letzten Gruppenspiel reichte, um den Viertelfinaleinzug zu schaffen., Italien begann die Euro 2004 mit zwei Unentschieden gegen Dänemark und Schweden. Trotz des späten 2:1-Erfolges gegen Bulgarien reichte es den Italienern nicht, da Dänemark und Schweden sich 2:2 trennten. Da schon im Vorhinein klar war, dass sich Dänemark und Schweden bei diesem Ergebnis beide für das Viertelfinale qualifizieren würden und der dänische Torwart in der 89. Minute noch den 2:2-Ausgleich der Schweden verursachte, kam in den italienischen Medien der Verdacht einer Absprache auf. Die ironisch gemeinte Äußerung des dänischen Trainers Morten Olsen (\\"„Natürlich machen wir einen Deal.“\\") heizte diese Spekulationen noch auf., Bulgarien war nach dem 0:5 gegen Schweden und der weiteren Niederlage gegen Dänemark schon vor dem letzten Spiel ausgeschieden. Die Bulgaren hielten im letzten Gruppenspiel gegen Italien gut mit und verloren erst durch ein Tor in der Nachspielzeit., Gruppe D., Tschechien gewann das erste Gruppenspiel nach einem 0:1-Rückstand gegen Lettland mit 2:1. Die Tschechen gewannen das zweite Spiel mit 3:2 gegen die Niederlande, das nach einem 0:2-Rückstand zustande kam. Die Stärke der tschechischen Mannschaft resultierte nicht nur aus ihrem technischen Können, sondern auch aus ihrer guten Moral und dem mannschaftlichen Zusammenhalt. Da Tschechien nach diesen zwei Siegen als Gruppensieger feststand, spielte im letzten Gruppenspiel gegen die deutsche Mannschaft eine B-Elf. Abermals lag die Mannschaft 0:1 hinten und gewann mit 2:1. Tschechien galt spätestens nach dem Weiterkommen in dieser Gruppe als einer der Anwärter auf den Titel des Europameisters., Die Niederlande erkämpften gegen Deutschland ein 1:1. Da das Spiel gegen Tschechien nach 2:0-Führung mit 2:3 verloren ging, konnten die Niederländer das Viertelfinale im letzten Spiel gegen Lettland nicht mehr aus eigener Kraft erreichen. Tschechien gelang wie bei den anderen beiden Gruppenspielen die Umwandlung eines Rückstands (hier von zwei Toren) in einen Sieg. Bereits im Vorfeld der EM gab es Unruhe im niederländischen Team, die von der Kritik am Trainer Dick Advocaat herrührte. Trotzdem gewann die Mannschaft mit 3:0 gegen Lettland und feierte dank der deutschen Niederlage gegen Tschechien den Einzug ins Viertelfinale., Deutschland schied – zum dritten Mal nach 1984 und 2000 – nach den Gruppenspielen aus. Im Spiel gegen die Niederlande kassierte die Mannschaft neun Minuten vor Schluss den Ausgleich. Gegen Lettland erreichte die Mannschaft ein torloses Remis. Da die Niederlande gegen Tschechien verloren, hätte die deutsche Mannschaft dank dieser Unterstützung mit einem Sieg gegen die B-Elf Tschechiens das Viertelfinale erreichen können. Die 1:0-Führung durch Michael Ballack drehten die Tschechen jedoch in ein 1:2., Lettland, dessen Qualifikation eine große Überraschung gewesen war, spielte gut mit. Die Letten verloren im Eröffnungsspiel trotz Führung gegen Tschechien und erkämpften sich gegen Deutschland ein 0:0. Dadurch gab es noch theoretisch die Möglichkeit, ins Viertelfinale einzuziehen. Doch gegen die Niederlande verloren die Balten deutlich mit 0:3., Finalrunde., 1 Sieg nach Silver Goal2 Sieg im Elfmeterschießen, Viertelfinale., Während der regulären Spielzeit geriet Portugal durch ein frühes Tor der Engländer in Rückstand.

Juli 1962 in Dortmund zur Saison 1963/64 eingeführt; zuvor wurde der deutsche Fußballmeister vom DFB in einer Endrunde mit Endspiel ermittelt., Rekordmeister der Bundesliga und der deutschen Meisterschaft ist der amtierende Meister FC Bayern München mit 32 (Bundesliga) bzw. 33 Titeln (gesamt)., Modus und Ausrichtung., Austragungsmodus., Während eines Meisterschaftsjahres, das sich in eine Hin- und Rückrunde unterteilt, treffen alle 18 Vereine der Bundesliga anhand eines vor der Saison festgelegten Spielplans zweimal aufeinander; einmal im eigenen Stadion und einmal im Stadion des Gegners. Eine Bundesligaspielzeit mit ihren (derzeit) 34 Spieltagen erstreckt sich in der Regel von August bis Mai. In Jahren, in denen eine Welt- oder Europameisterschaft stattfindet, endet die Spielzeit zum Teil bereits im April. Im Winter wurde bis Mitte der 1980er bis auf eine kurze Unterbrechung durchgespielt. Dabei fand mit dem Spiel des 1. FC Nürnberg gegen den VfB Stuttgart (1:1) am 31. Dezember 1964 auch eine Partie am Silvestertag statt. Eine von Anfang Dezember bis Ende Februar dauernde Winterpause wurde erstmals zur Saison 1986/87 eingeführt, aktuell werden üblicherweise drei Wochen im Dezember und Januar pausiert. Die einzelnen Spieltage wurden früher immer samstags um 15:30 Uhr angepfiffen, auch heute finden vier oder fünf der neun Spiele um diese Uhrzeit statt. Seit längerer Zeit finden auch ein Spiel am Freitagabend und zwei (manchmal auch drei) Spiele am Sonntagnachmittag statt. Ein weiteres Spiel findet seit einigen Jahren samstags um 18:30 statt. Ab der Saison 2017/18 wurden erstmals fünf Spiele pro Saison am Montagabend angepfiffen, aufgrund heftiger Proteste der Fans wurden sie zur Saison 2021/22 wieder abgeschafft.

Die Schlüsselzahl und damit der Spielplan wird unter Zuhilfenahme eines Computerprogramms unter Berücksichtigung relevanter Parameter wie anderer Großereignisse vorgeschlagen. Die Terminfestsetzung der Spiele richtet sich nach dem Rahmenterminkalender der FIFA und UEFA. Zudem wird die Zentrale Informationsstelle für Sicherheit (ZIS) frühzeitig in die Spieltagsplanung einbezogen, um ihn abzusegnen und sogenannte Doppler auszuschließen. So sollen beispielsweise gleichzeitige Heimspiele von Borussia Dortmund und dem FC Schalke 04 vermieden werden., Die Mannschaft, die nach dem letzten Spieltag der Rückrunde den ersten Platz belegt, erhält bis zum Abschluss des darauffolgenden Meisterschaftsjahres den Titel „Deutscher Fußballmeister“. Die zwei letztplatzierten Mannschaften müssen in die 2. Bundesliga absteigen, deren zwei erstplatzierte Mannschaften im Gegenzug direkt in die Bundesliga aufsteigen. Darüber hinaus finden seit der Saison 2008/09 (wieder) Relegationsspiele zwischen dem Drittletzten der Bundesliga und dem Drittplatzierten der 2. Bundesliga statt. Neben dem Deutschen Meister und den Absteigern werden über die Bundesliga auch die Teilnehmer an den europäischen Vereinswettbewerben ermittelt. Dabei bestimmt die UEFA-Fünfjahreswertung, welcher nationale Verband mit wie vielen Vereinen in der Champions League (bis 1992: Europapokal der Landesmeister), der UEFA Europa League oder der UEFA Europa Conference League (früher im UEFA-Pokal und UEFA Intertoto Cup) vertreten ist und zu welcher Phase die Klubs in die Wettbewerbe einsteigen. Je höher eine Liga in der UEFA-Fünfjahreswertung steht, desto mehr Vereine aus dieser Spielklasse haben die Möglichkeit, am internationalen Wettbewerb teilzunehmen. Aufgrund der gegenwärtigen Platzierung Deutschlands in der Fünfjahreswertung nehmen Meister, Vizemeister und der Dritt- und Viertplatzierte der Bundesliga an der Champions League teil. Seit der Saison 2016/17 qualifiziert sich neben dem Drittplatzierten auch der Viertplatzierte direkt für die Champions League; seither gibt es keine Champions-League-Qualifikationsspiele mehr. Der Meisterschaftsfünfte ist ebenso wie der DFB-Pokalsieger für die Europa League qualifiziert, der Sechstplatzierte nimmt an den Play-off-Spielen für die Europa Conference League teil. Alle an der Bundesliga teilnehmenden Mannschaften sind automatisch auch für den DFB-Pokal qualifiziert. Ist der DFB-Pokalsieger bereits über die Bundesliga für die Champions League oder die Europa League qualifiziert, spielt der Tabellensechste in der Europa League, während der Siebtplatzierte an der Qualifikationsrunde zur Europa Conference League teilnimmt. Zusätzlich konnten sich bis zur Saison 2015/16 weitere Mannschaften über die Fair-Play-Wertung qualifizieren. Dies gelang 2005 dem 1. FSV Mainz 05 und 2008 Hertha BSC jeweils für den UEFA-Pokal., Nach jeder Partie erhält die siegreiche Mannschaft drei Punkte und die besiegte keinen Punkt, bei einem Unentschieden jede Mannschaft einen Punkt. Die erreichten Punkte einer Spielzeit werden addiert und ergeben so für jeden Spieltag eine aktuelle Rangliste der Vereine. Bei Punktgleichheit entscheidet die bessere Tordifferenz über die Reihenfolge der Platzierung, bei gleicher Differenz die Anzahl der erzielten Tore. Sollten danach zwei Mannschaften immer noch gleichplatziert sein, entscheidet das Gesamtergebnis aus den Partien gegeneinander, wobei die auswärts erzielten Tore stärker zählen. Falls auch die erzielten Auswärtstore in allen Spielen gleich sind, wird auf neutralem Platz ein Entscheidungsspiel ausgetragen. Dies war bisher in der Bundesliga jedoch noch nie der Fall., Der Austragungsmodus der Bundesliga ist seit der Erstaustragung 1963 nahezu unverändert geblieben. Es schwankte nur die Zahl der teilnehmenden Vereine (16, 18, 20) sowie die Anzahl der Abstiegsplätze (2 bis 4). Zeitweilig wurden, wie auch aktuell, Relegationsspiele zur Ermittlung eines Auf- und Absteigers (oder auch des beidseitigen Klassenverbleibs) ausgetragen, vgl. dazu \\"Relegation zur deutschen Fußball-Bundesliga\\". Bis 1969 wurde bei Punktgleichheit nicht die Tordifferenz, sondern der Torquotient herangezogen. Die Drei-Punkte-Regel gilt seit der Saison 1995/96. Davor gab es für einen Sieg zwei Punkte und für ein Unentschieden einen Punkt. In der Tabelle wurden dabei für jede Mannschaft die gewonnenen Punkte zu den nicht gewonnenen bzw. abgegebenen Punkten ins Verhältnis gesetzt., Qualifikation für Europäische Wettbewerbe., Neben dem Meister qualifizieren sich die Mannschaften auf den Plätzen 2 bis 4 ebenfalls für die Gruppenphase der UEFA Champions League. Der Fünftplatzierte und der Sieger des DFB-Pokal starten in der Gruppenphase der UEFA Europa League. Der Sechstplatzierte erreicht die Play-offs der UEFA Europa Conference League. Landet der Pokalsieger auf einem der ersten 5 Plätzen in der Liga, rückt der 6. in die Europa League auf, und die Mannschaft auf Platz 7 spielt in der Conference League. Dies gilt ebenso, wenn der Pokalsieger in der abgelaufenen Saison Platz 6 belegt., Sollte eine Mannschaft einen europäischen Wettbewerb gewinnen, die sich über die Liga nicht erneut für einen Europapokal qualifizieren konnte, erhöht sich das deutsche Starterfeld um eine weitere Mannschaft. Letztmals war dies nach der Saison 2021/22 der Fall, als Eintracht Frankfurt die Europe League gewann, aber in der Liga nur Platz 11 belegte. Als Folge dessen starten in der kommenden Saison 5 deutsche Mannschaften in der Champions League., Ausrichter (DFB/DFL)., Bis ins Jahr 2001 wurde die Bundesliga unter dem Dach des Deutschen Fußball-Bundes (DFB) ausgetragen. Seitdem sind der DFB und die als Zusammenschluss der 36 Lizenzvereine der Bundesliga und 2. Bundesliga gegründete Deutsche Fußball Liga (offiziell: \\"DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga e. V.\\", bis August 2016 \\"Ligaverband\\"/\\"Die Liga – Fußballverband e. V.\\") gemeinsame Veranstalter. Ein Grundlagenvertrag regelt das Verhältnis zwischen DFB und DFL e.V. Die operativen Aufgaben hat der DFL-Verein an seine hundertprozentige Tochter, die \\"DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH\\" (DFL), übertragen., Ziel der Deutschen Fußball Liga ist der Erhalt und die Stärkung des professionell betriebenen Fußballs in Deutschland. Die DFL sieht sich dabei als Dienstleister für alle Mitglieder der beiden Ligen und vertritt die Vereine gegenüber Medien und Öffentlichkeit. Grundsätzlich ist das Aufgabengebiet der DFL in die drei Hauptzweige Spielbetrieb, Lizenzierung und Vermarktung gegliedert. Neben der Organisation des Profifußballs, bei der die DFL für die Ansetzung aller 68 Spiele in der Bundesliga und 2. Bundesliga je Saison zuständig ist, vergibt sie die Übertragungsrechte an den Spielen der Lizenzligen für Fernseh- und Hörfunkübertragungen sowie im Internet. Außerdem betreibt die DFL nationale sowie internationale Markenbildung und ist für die Lizenzierung der 36 Profiklubs der 1. und 2. Bundesliga zuständig., Lizenzierung., Zur Teilnahme an der Bundesliga benötigt jede Mannschaft eine Lizenz von der DFL bzw. früher vom DFB. Die Lizenz wird aufgrund sportlicher, rechtlicher, personell-administrativer, infrastruktureller und sicherheitstechnischer, medientechnischer sowie finanzieller Kriterien vergeben. Hierbei stehen die genannten Voraussetzungen gleichgewichtig nebeneinander, jedoch entscheidet sich die Vergabe einer Lizenz regelmäßig an den finanziellen Kriterien, welche die wirtschaftliche Leistungsfähigkeit der Vereine sicherstellen sollen., Nachdem die wirtschaftliche Leistungsfähigkeit der Klubs bis 2007 lediglich im Frühjahr überprüft wurde, wird ab der Saison 2007/08 eine sogenannte „Lizenzierungsnachschau“ eingeführt. Hierbei wird die Finanzlage wirtschaftlich schwächerer Klubs, die ihre Lizenz nur mit Auflagen erhalten, im Herbst erneut geprüft. Auf der Basis der Bilanz zum 30.

Juni bis zum 7. Juli 1974 in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und West-Berlin statt., Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland gewann das Turnier mit einem 2:1-Sieg über die Niederlande im Finale von München und wurde damit zum zweiten Mal, nach 1954, Fußball-Weltmeister – als erster Weltmeister, der auch aktueller Europameister war, welches erst die spanische Fußballnationalmannschaft 2010 wiederholen konnte. Den dritten Platz belegte die Mannschaft Polens, die mit Grzegorz Lato, der während des Turniers sieben Tore erzielte, den Torschützenkönig stellte. Titelverteidiger Brasilien wurde Vierter, der Vize-Weltmeister von 1970 (Italien) schied bereits in der ersten Runde aus., Vergabe., Nach mehreren erfolglosen Bewerbungen erhielt die Bundesrepublik Deutschland am 6. Juli 1966 während des FIFA-Kongresses in London den Zuschlag für die Austragung der Weltmeisterschaft 1974. Das Votum war einstimmig. Die unterlegenen Mitbewerber Argentinien und Spanien gingen nicht leer aus: Argentinien bekam die Ausrichtung der WM 1978 und Spanien die der WM 1982 zugesprochen, und hatte somit fast 16 Jahre Zeit, um sich vorzubereiten – so viel wie noch kein anderer Veranstalter., Bereits drei Monate früher, am 16. April 1966, hatte die bayerische Landeshauptstadt München den Zuschlag für die Olympischen Spiele 1972 erhalten. Das Jahr 1966 bedeutete somit einen Durchbruch für die bundesdeutsche Sportdiplomatie, da 21Jahre nach Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs und der nationalsozialistischen Herrschaft ein deutscher Staat wieder für würdig befunden wurde, die beiden bedeutendsten internationalen Sportveranstaltungen auszurichten., Spielorte., Die Spiele der Weltmeisterschaft wurden in neun Stadien in neun verschiedenen Städten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland einschließlich West-Berlin ausgetragen., Qualifikation., Die Bewerbungsfrist zur Teilnahme an der Qualifikation zur Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1974 endete am 30. Juni 1971. Die Auslosung der Qualifikationsgruppen fand am 17. Juli 1971 in Düsseldorf statt. Von 99 gemeldeten Nationen waren zwei direkt für die Endrunde qualifiziert. Nachdem sieben Mannschaften ihre Teilnahme zurückgezogen hatten, nahmen schließlich 90 an der Qualifikation teil. Neben dem amtierenden Weltmeister Brasilien und Gastgeber BR Deutschland, die automatisch zur Teilnahme am Turnier berechtigt waren, konnten sich 14 weitere Mannschaften für die WM-Endrunde qualifizieren., Überraschend dabei war insbesondere das Ausscheiden Englands gegen Polen, womit bei der Weltmeisterschaft 1974 ein früherer Weltmeister fehlte. Zum wiederholten Male setzte sich auch Bulgarien durch, diesmal gegen Portugal, dessen große Zeit und die von Eusébio endgültig vorbei war. Etwas unerwartet schied in der Qualifikation auch Spanien gegen Jugoslawien aus und Mexiko belegte in der Qualifikationsrunde hinter Haiti und Trinidad und Tobago nur den dritten Platz. Neben den Fußballern der Karibik schafften erstmals auch die DDR, Australien und Zaire, als erstes südlich der Sahara gelegene Land überhaupt, die Qualifikation., Während die Sieger der restlichen Qualifikationsgruppen direkt für die Weltmeisterschaft qualifiziert waren, musste die Sowjetunion als Erster der Europagruppe 9 in zwei Play-off-Spielen um die Teilnahme an der WM-Endrunde gegen Chile, den Sieger der Südamerika-Gruppe 3, antreten. Im ersten Spiel in Moskau trennten sich beide Mannschaften 0:0. Zum Rückspiel in Chile trat die Sowjetunion nicht an, da das Spiel im Nationalstadion von Santiago de Chile durchgeführt werden sollte, in dem während des von der CIA gestützten Militärputsches nur wenige Wochen vorher im September 1973 Oppositionelle inhaftiert worden waren. Später wurde von Folterungen und Morden, die dort stattgefunden hatten, berichtet. Trotzdem wurde das Spiel angepfiffen, jedoch nach dem 1:0 abgebrochen, da mangels anwesender sowjetischer Spieler kein Wiederanstoß möglich war. Die sowjetische Mannschaft wurde von der FIFA disqualifiziert und das Spiel 2:0 für Chile gewertet. Nur der Euphorie aufgrund der erstmals geglückten WM-Qualifikation der DDR-Auswahl war es zu verdanken, dass die DDR an der WM weiter teilnahm., Für die Endrunde der Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1974 in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland qualifizierten sich schließlich die folgenden Mannschaften:, Modus., Die WM 1974 wurde nach einem neuen Modus ausgetragen. Zwar bildeten die 16 Teilnehmer wie gehabt vier Gruppen mit je vier Mannschaften, von denen sich jeweils die ersten beiden für die nächste Runde qualifizierten. Jedoch wurde das Turnier nicht im K.-o.-System fortgesetzt, sondern in zwei Zwischenrunden-Gruppen mit je vier Mannschaften. Die Sieger der zweiten Finalrunde bestritten das Endspiel um die Weltmeisterschaft, die Zweitplatzierten das Spiel um Platz drei., Zwar hatte es 1950 schon eine zweite Gruppenphase gegeben, jedoch spielten damals nur die besten Vier gegeneinander, und es gab kein Endspiel. Mit dieser Neuerung sollte zum einen verhindert werden, dass ein Favorit in der K.-o.-Runde früh ausschied, so wie bei der WM 1970 die Engländer, und zum anderen sorgten mehr Partien für höhere Einnahmen. So musste eine Mannschaft, die Weltmeister werden wollte, erstmals sieben statt sechs Spiele bestreiten. Die Gesamtzahl der Spiele erhöhte sich damit von 32 auf 38, womit sich die Investitionen in den Stadionneu- und -umbau besser begründen ließen, zumal es im Gegensatz zur WM 1970 neun statt fünf Austragungsorte gab. Speziell im Hinblick auf die WM 1974 wurde die Zuordnung zu den beiden Gruppen der zweiten Finalrunde im Vorfeld mit der Absicht festgelegt, dass Veranstalter und Europameister Deutschland und Weltmeister Brasilien als erwartete Sieger ihrer Vorrundengruppen in der zweiten Finalrunde nicht aufeinandertreffen sollten, wodurch ein WM-Finale mit den beiden Favoriten unmöglich geworden wäre. Lediglich wenn einer von beiden Gruppenzweiter geworden wäre, wäre es zu einem vorzeitigen Aufeinandertreffen gekommen – sofern der andere Erster geworden wäre. Da sowohl die Bundesrepublik nach der Niederlage gegen die DDR als auch Brasilien auf Grund der schlechteren Tordifferenz gegenüber Jugoslawien in ihren Gruppen nur Zweite wurden, trafen sie in der Zwischenrunde nicht aufeinander. Die DFB-Elf kam als Gruppenzweiter in die Gruppe B; die DDR als Gruppensieger traf dagegen als erste deutsche Mannschaft bei einer Weltmeisterschaft in Gruppe A auf die Brasilianer., Der 1974 neu eingeführte Modus hatte bei der folgenden Weltmeisterschaft in Argentinien Bestand. Dort zeigten sich erste Schwächen, als Argentinien nur wegen der besseren Tordifferenz gegenüber den im gesamten Turnier ungeschlagenen Brasilianern das Endspiel erreichte. Nach einer noch weniger gelungenen Zwischenlösung bei der WM 1982 wurde ab der WM 1986 wieder das K.-o.-System nach der Vorrunde verwendet., Bei Punktgleichheit mehrerer Mannschaften in den Gruppenspielen entschied zunächst die Tordifferenz und dann die Anzahl der erzielten Treffer über die Platzierung. Bei übereinstimmenden Punkten und Toren hätte in der ersten Finalrunde das Los entschieden, in der zweiten Finalrunde hingegen zunächst das Ergebnis (also die bessere Platzierung) aus der ersten Finalrunde und schließlich ebenfalls das Los über den endgültigen Tabellenstand. Ein Unentschieden im Finale sowie im Spiel um den dritten Platz hätte zunächst zur Verlängerung der Spielzeit geführt. Hätte die Verlängerung keine Entscheidung gebracht, wäre der Sieger im Spiel um Platz drei direkt im Elfmeterschießen ermittelt worden. Beim Endspiel hätte es eine Neuansetzung innerhalb der nächsten Tage gegeben. Erst nach einem Unentschieden trotz Verlängerung im zweiten Finale hätte ein Elfmeterschießen die Weltmeisterschaft 1974 entschieden., Nachdem bei der WM 1970 bereits die Rote Karte in das Regelwerk aufgenommen worden war, ohne jedoch eingesetzt zu werden, wurde die erste Rote Karte bei einer Fußball-WM am 14. Juni 1974 im Vorrundenspiel BR Deutschland – Chile gegen den Chilenen Caszely nach einem Revanchefoul an Berti Vogts vom türkischen Schiedsrichter Doğan Babacan gezeigt. Anschließend zeigten die Schiedsrichter noch vier weitere Rote Karten im Turnierverlauf., Neuer WM-Pokal., Nachdem der Coupe Jules Rimet nach der Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1970 in Mexiko mit dem dritten Titelgewinn der Brasilianer in den ständigen Besitz der Südamerikaner übergegangen war, stiftete der Weltverband FIFA für die kommenden Weltmeisterschaften den neuen FIFA-WM-Pokal. Künstler aus sieben Ländern reichten insgesamt 53 Entwürfe dafür ein. Die Entscheidung fiel schließlich auf das Werk des italienischen Künstlers Silvio Gazzaniga, dessen Trophäe zwei triumphierende Fußballspieler, die gemeinsam die Weltkugel in ihren ausgestreckten Händen halten, beschreibt., Der bei der Weltmeisterschaft 1974 erstmals überreichte Pokal besteht aus massivem 18-karätigen Gold, ist 36,8 Zentimeter hoch und wiegt 6175 Gramm. Im Sockel, auf dessen Unterseite die Gewinner des Pokals eingraviert werden, sind zwei Ringe aus dem Halbedelstein Malachit eingelegt., Im Gegensatz zu seinem Vorgänger bleibt die neue Trophäe stets Eigentum der FIFA und kann nicht dauerhaft von einem Land gewonnen werden. Der amtierende Weltmeister behielt zunächst den Pokal bis zur nächsten WM und bekam im Anschluss eine Nachbildung, die nicht wie das Original aus massivem Gold, sondern lediglich vergoldet war. Mittlerweile wird der Pokal direkt nach dem Finale, spätestens bei der Abreise aus dem Gastland an die FIFA zurückgegeben und der Weltmeister erhält im Gegenzug eine Replik., Auslosung., Die Auslosung der WM-Endrunde fand am 5. Januar 1974 im großen Sendesaal des Hessischen Rundfunks in Frankfurt statt. Die Veranstaltung wurde weltweit von etwa 800 Millionen Menschen verfolgt., Für die Auslosung wurden die qualifizierten Mannschaften in vier Töpfe aufgeteilt. Die Zuordnung erfolgte nach einem Beschluss der FIFA vom selben Tage. Als Grundlage dienten neben einer Beurteilung des Leistungsvermögens, welches sich aus früheren Erfolgen und augenblicklichen Resultaten addierte, sowie geografische, kontinentale sowie sportpolitische Aspekte. Eine Besonderheit war, dass zum Zeitpunkt der Auslosung erst 15 der insgesamt 16 Teilnehmer bekannt waren, da in der Qualifikationsgruppe 7 ein Entscheidungsspiel zwischen Spanien und dem sich schließlich qualifizierenden Jugoslawien nötig war, das erst am 13. Februar 1974 stattfand.

Set within the enchanting world of Palladium Fantasy, Carthania is a land characterized by its unique blend of Cuban mannerisms, a suspicious and fearful disposition towards outsiders, and a strong sense of national pride and identity. At the heart of Carthania lies a monarchy headed by the esteemed and respected ruler, Bashnier. Known as the \\"Carths,\\" the people of Carthania display a fierce loyalty to their kingdom and harbor a deep wariness towards foreigners, stemming from a long history of territorial disputes and conflicts. Their cautious nature is a reflection of their instinctual need to protect their way of life. Carthania stands out for its marvelous military architecture, characterized by towering citadels, fortified walls, and commanding defensive structures. The sight of these imposing edifices serves as a testament to the nation's strength and indomitable spirit. Military might plays a crucial role in their society, both for self-defense and expansionist ambitions. The Carthanian economy is highly efficient and operates within a controlled market. Trade flourishes within the kingdom's borders, ensuring a stable and organized flow of resources. Yet, despite their economic prowess, the Carths remain watchful, ever cautious of the influence and manipulation of foreign powers. Notably, Carthania upholds a unique approach to justice and redemption. The kingdom employs special units known as \\"prison legions,\\" where prisoners can earn their freedom after accumulating a formidable 1000 kills in battle. This unorthodox system offers criminals a slim chance at redemption, although it is not without controversy and criticism. Carthanian society also embraces slavery, a practice considered normal within their cultural context. Slaves are acquired through various means, including conquest, trade, and even internal punishment for heinous crimes. However, the treatment of slaves and their conditions can vary greatly throughout the realm. One fascinating aspect of Carthania's urban landscape is the presence of gargoyle statues pervasive throughout the cities. These stony guardians serve as an efficient security measure, providing constant vigilance against potential threats and intruders. Their intimidating presence is an ever-present reminder of the Carthanian people's commitment to safety and defense. In summary, Carthania is a captivating human kingdom within the Palladium Fantasy setting, blending Cuban mannerisms, a suspicious nature towards outsiders, and deeply-rooted traditions.

Here are four ways in which a modern military unit could infiltrate any of the cities or towns in the Kingdom of Carthania: 1. Covert Night Operation: Under the cover of darkness, the military unit could perform a stealthy insertion into the target city using advanced night vision and stealth equipment. Utilizing their training in small-unit tactics, they would move silently and undetected through the outskirts of the city, relying on their knowledge of the terrain and hiding in the shadows. Once inside, they would navigate through alleyways and backstreets to reach their objective, avoiding patrols and surveillance. 2. Undercover as Civilians: The military unit could assume civilian identities, utilizing local disguises and blending into the daily life of the city. By seamlessly integrating themselves into the population, they would gather intelligence, maintain a low profile, and identify potential threats or vulnerabilities. This approach would require the unit members to fully research and understand the local culture, customs, and language to avoid arousing suspicion. 3. Electronic Surveillance and Cyber Infiltration: Using advanced surveillance and hacking capabilities, the military unit could infiltrate the city's network infrastructure and surveillance systems. By exploiting vulnerabilities and backdoors, they would gain access to key data and surveillance feeds, allowing them to monitor the city's activities, identify high-value targets, and gather intelligence for future operations. Through covert cyber infiltration, they could control critical systems to create distractions or disrupt security measures. 4. Airborne Assault: Leveraging aerial capabilities, the military unit could conduct an airborne assault on the target city. Utilizing helicopters or transport aircraft, they would perform a high-speed insertion onto designated landing zones within the city or nearby. From there, they would swiftly secure key strategic positions, neutralize threats, and establish a stronghold from which they can gather intelligence or carry out specific objectives. This method allows for rapid deployment and shock effect to overwhelm the city's defenses. 5. Collaborative Approach with Local Forces: Instead of a direct infiltration, the military unit could covertly work alongside local forces or resistance groups sympathetic to their cause. By forming alliances and sharing resources, the joint team could exploit local knowledge, gather intelligence,"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Comedy-Fernsehserie, Comedy Central, Dystopie im Film, Fernsehserie (Fox Broadcasting Company), Fernsehserie (Vereinigte Staaten), Fernsehserie der 1990er Jahre, Fernsehserie der 2000er Jahre, Fernsehserie der 2010er Jahre, Futurama, Science-Fiction-Fernsehserie], Futurama ist eine Science-Fiction-Zeichentrickserie von Matt Groening und David X. Cohen, die zu Beginn des 31. Jahrhunderts spielt und von Alltag und Abenteuern der befreundeten Mitarbeiter des interstellaren Lieferunternehmens \\"Planet Express\\" mit Sitz in \\"Neu New York\\" erzählt., Die erste Folge wurde von dem US-amerikanischen Fernsehsender Fox am 28. März 1999 ausgestrahlt, die erste Folge der deutschen Synchronfassung am 4. September 2000 von ProSieben. 2003 wurde die Serie abgesetzt. Nachdem Wiederholungen gute Einschaltquoten erzielten, erlebte sie 2007 ein Comeback in Form von vier Direct-to-Video-Produktionen in Spielfilmlänge. Aufgeteilt in jeweils vier Episoden wurden diese ab 2008 als neue Staffel bei Comedy Central ausgestrahlt. Mit der Ausstrahlung von zwei weiteren Staffeln begann der Sender im Juni 2010, danach wurde die Serie erneut eingestellt. Am 4. September 2013 wurde die letzte von insgesamt 140 Episoden veröffentlicht., Am 9. Februar 2022 kündigte der Streaminganbieter Hulu an, eine weitere 20 Folgen umfassende Staffel zu produzieren. Die Veröffentlichung wurde für die USA auf Hulu und für Deutschland auf Disney+ für den 24. Juli 2023 angekündigt., Kritiker lobten das Werk vor allem wegen seines Humors. Es wurde unter anderem mit sechs Emmy- und sieben Annie-Awards ausgezeichnet., Inhalt., Die Handlung der Serie beginnt Silvester 1999, als der New Yorker Pizzabote Philip J. Fry um Mitternacht – scheinbar versehentlich – in einen kryostatischen Tiefschlaf versetzt wird, aus dem er eintausend Jahre später Silvester 2999 wieder erwacht. Bei \\"Planet Express\\", einem interplanetaren Lieferdienst, der von seinem entfernten Nachfahren Professor Farnsworth geleitet wird, nimmt er eine Anstellung an. In seinen Mitarbeitern findet er Freunde. Die nachfolgenden Episoden stürzen die Kollegen in skurrile Abenteuer, die etwa durch Lieferaufträge zu entfernten Planeten oder Erfindungen des Professors ausgelöst werden. Dabei werden Themen junger Erwachsener behandelt, die sich eher über ihre Arbeit und ihr soziales Netzwerk als über eine Familie definieren: Erwerbstätigkeit, Freundschaft, Liebe, Sex., Die einzelnen Folgen sind in sich geschlossen und kehren an ihrem Ende im Wesentlichen zur Ausgangssituation zurück. Gleichzeitig bauen sie aufeinander auf, und die Charaktere entwickeln sich im Laufe der Serie weiter. Soweit dagegen Details für die Serie nebensächlich bleiben, werden Anschlussfehler in Kauf genommen, um Themen der Gegenwart und Klischees des Science-Fiction-Genres zu persiflieren., Figuren., Die Belegschaft von \\"Planet Express\\" stellt die Hauptfiguren von \\"Futurama\\": eine kleine Gruppe von Individualisten, die sich nicht in die Gleichförmigkeit ihrer Zukunftsgesellschaft einfügen. Das zentrale Trio, bestehend aus Fry, Leela und dem Roboter Bender, taucht in jeder Episode auf, wenngleich der Fokus einzelner Geschichten bisweilen auch auf einer der anderen Haupt- oder Nebenfiguren liegt., Philip J. Fry, Protagonist der Serie ist der Mittzwanziger Philip J. Fry, der bei seinem Nachnamen gerufen wird. Der Antiheld wird als unreif, einfältig, faul und antriebslos charakterisiert, ein Couch-Potato und College-Abbrecher ohne besondere Begabungen oder Ambitionen. Mit seinem Leben am Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts war Fry, der als Pizzabote jobbte, unzufrieden; tausend Jahre später gilt er zwar noch immer als Versager, sein neues Leben als Lieferjunge bei \\"Planet Express\\" gefällt ihm aber besser. Seine lange Zeit unerwiderte Liebe gilt seiner Kollegin Leela., Turanga Leela, Leela ist die kompetente und verantwortungsvolle, bisweilen aber ihre Aggressionen nicht unter Kontrolle habende Pilotin des Lieferraumschiffs von \\"Planet Express\\". Sie ist in Frys Alter und trotz ihres sexy Äußeren frustrierter Single. Kurz nach der Geburt von ihren Eltern ausgesetzt, wuchs die einäugige Leela in einem Waisenhaus in dem Glauben auf, eine Außerirdische unbekannter Herkunft zu sein, möglicherweise die Letzte ihrer Art. Erst im Laufe der Serie erfährt sie, dass sie ein Kind menschlicher Mutanten ist. Dank ausgereifter Kampfsport-Fähigkeiten besiegt sie ihre Gegner in körperlichen Auseinandersetzungen regelmäßig., Bender Bending Rodriguez, Frys bester Freund und Mitbewohner ist Bender, ein humanoider Roboter. Ursprünglich zum Biegen von Stahlträgern gebaut, führt er ein egozentrisches und nach menschlichen Maßstäben lasterhaftes Leben: Er flucht, trinkt, raucht Zigarren, ist faul, mag das Glücksspiel, konsumiert Roboter-Pornografie, besucht Roboter-Prostituierte, bestiehlt sogar seine Freunde regelmäßig und wünscht sich nicht selten, die gesamte Menschheit zu töten., Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, Der einzige noch lebende Verwandte von Fry ist der 160-jährige Professor Farnsworth, Gründer und Chef von \\"Planet Express\\". Zugleich lehrt der schrullige, zerstreute Wissenschaftler als Physik-Professor an der \\"Mars-Universität\\". Er hat keine Skrupel, seine Mannschaft immer wieder auf lebensgefährliche Missionen zu schicken. Trotz seiner fortgeschrittenen Demenz gelingt ihm immer wieder die Erfindung neuer Gerätschaften. Neben seiner immer wieder auftretenden geistigen Schwäche leidet er auch an diversen anderen Altersgebrechen wie Inkontinenz, seniler Bettfluch und starker Kurzsichtigkeit, weshalb er eine extrem starke Brille tragen muss. Er hat einen dreizehnjährigen Klon-Sohn, Cubert Farnsworth., Hermes Conrad, Hermes erledigt die Verwaltung und Buchhaltung bei \\"Planet Express\\". Stets bemüht, die Produktivität des Unternehmens zu steigern, ermahnt er seine Kollegen regelmäßig, sich bei der Arbeit mehr zu bemühen. Der Jamaikaner ist ein gewissenhafter und akribischer Bürokrat aus Überzeugung, aber auch treuer Familienmensch und früherer Olympiateilnehmer in der Disziplin Limbo. Seine Frau LaBarbara ist ungleich attraktiver. Ihr gemeinsamer Sohn Dwight ist etwa im selben Alter wie der Klon des Professors, Cubert. Beide sind eng befreundet und besuchen gemeinsam ein Internat., Dr. John Zoidberg, Dr.Zoidberg ist ein menschengroßer, krabbenartiger Außerirdischer. Obwohl er kaum etwas über die menschliche Anatomie weiß, arbeitet er als Belegschaftsarzt bei \\"Planet Express\\" und es gelingen ihm mitunter erstaunlich komplexe Eingriffe. Trotz dieses Berufs lebt er in Armut und sucht verzweifelt nach Freundschaft und Anerkennung. Wie sich in einer Folge herausstellt, ist Zoidberg nicht einmal Mediziner, sondern hat seinen Doktortitel in Kunstgeschichte erworben. Er und der Professor sind schon lange befreundet., Amy Wong, Amy, die jüngste der Hauptfiguren, studierte zunächst Ingenieurwesen an der \\"Mars-Universität\\" und ist Praktikantin bei \\"Planet Express\\". Sie ist zwar oberflächlich, tollpatschig und gelegentlich naiv, gilt aber wegen ihres niedlich-hübschen Aussehens als besonders attraktiv. Andererseits stellt sie auch immer wieder ihr Wissen, Integrität und bisweilen auch Tiefgang unter Beweis. Das verwöhnte Einzelkind äußerst reicher Eltern chinesischer Abstammung geht gerne aus und flirtet gern. Sie spricht dementsprechend auch Chinesisch und verfällt vor allem beim Fluchen ab und an in ihre Muttersprache. Des Weiteren beherrscht sie Marsianisch. Die Eltern, denen eine Hälfte des Planeten Mars gehört, haben keinen größeren Wunsch, als dass ihnen ihre Tochter endlich Enkelkinder schenkt. Dabei ist ihnen letztlich egal, wer der Vater ist, sie versuchen indes dennoch, Amy immer wieder mit Männern zu verkuppeln. Im Laufe der Serie beginnt sie eine romantische Beziehung zu Kif Kroker und erlangt ihren Doktortitel., Weitere Figuren, Außerdem gehört eine Reihe wiederkehrender Nebenfiguren zum Ensemble der Serie. Zu den wichtigsten, die bisweilen zu den zentralen Figuren einzelner Episoden avancieren, zählen der Raumschiffflotten-Kapitän Zapp Brannigan, sein außerirdischer Erster Offizier Kif Kroker, Leelas vermeintliches Haustier Nibbler, die Monopolistin Mom und deren drei minderbemittelte Söhne oder auch der Roboterteufel und der Schauspiel-Roboter Calculon. Auch Figuren, die für die Handlung ohne Bedeutung bleiben, tauchen in unregelmäßigen Abständen auf, beispielsweise der Arbeiter Sal und der \\"Planet-Express\\"-Hausmeister Scruffy. Hinter der hohen Figurendichte steht die Absicht, den treuen Zuschauer für seine Aufmerksamkeit zu belohnen., Fester Bestandteil von \\"Futurama\\" ist die Idee, dass es künftig möglich sein wird, menschliche Köpfe in übergroßen Einmachgläsern am Leben zu halten. Dadurch können Prominente der Gegenwart und historische Persönlichkeiten in die Serie eingebaut werden, entweder in Form eines Gastauftritts oder einer Parodie. Größere Gastauftritte als Köpfe in Einmachgläsern haben unter anderem die Beastie Boys, Stephen W. Hawking, Beck, Lucy Liu, Al Gore, Conan O’Brien und die Brückencrew aus der Science-Fiction-Serie \\"Raumschiff Enterprise\\" (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig und George Takei). Dagegen wird der ehemalige US-Präsident Richard Nixon bei zahlreichen Auftritten mit grundsätzlich unsympathischer Färbung parodiert., Schauplatz., Neu New York., \\"Futurama\\" ist zu Beginn des 31. Jahrhunderts angesiedelt, einer Zeit voller technologischer Wunder. Den Hauptschauplatz der Serie bildet das futuristische \\"Neu New York\\", wo \\"Planet Express\\" seinen Sitz hat. Die Metropole wurde über dem zerstörten New York erbaut. Dessen Ruinen liegen, nun als „altes New York“ bezeichnet, wie in einer Katakombe im Abwassersystem der neuen Stadt und dienen einer Gruppe von der Oberfläche verbannter Mutanten als Wohnstätte. \\"Neu New York\\" ist eine Stadt der Extreme, voller Kriminalität, Armut und Prostitution, und ein Schmelztiegel der Kulturen. Viele Orte in der Stadt stellen eine Referenz zu Orten des gegenwärtigen New York dar, präsentieren sich aber als deren Weiterentwicklung – so tritt beispielsweise anstelle des Madison Square Garden der \\"Madison Cube Garden\\". Das Automobil wurde vom schwebenden Hovercar abgelöst und die herkömmlichen öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel durch ein System aus Röhren ersetzt, das die Passagiere rohrpostartig ansaugt und zum Zielort transportiert., Gesellschaft und Kultur., \\"Futurama\\" führt die Zukunft einer kapitalistischen Gesellschaft vor. Entgegen anderen Science-Fiction-Werken lässt sich die Serie dabei nicht in die Kategorien Utopie oder Dystopie einteilen; die Zukunft dient hier vielmehr als Kulisse für eine übertreibende Darstellung der heutigen Gesellschaft.

Das Team bestritt während des Algerienkrieges zwischen 1958 und 1962 in Osteuropa, Asien und Afrika etwa 80 Begegnungen, wobei es sportlich sehr erfolgreich war. Es setzte sich aus Spielern zusammen, die bis unmittelbar vor seiner Gründung größtenteils in der professionellen Première Division des „Mutterlandes“ Frankreich, vereinzelt auch bei nordafrikanischen Vereinen tätig waren. Nachdem Algerien die Unabhängigkeit erlangt hatte, arbeiteten zahlreiche seiner rund 30 Mitglieder als Spieler, Trainer oder Funktionäre im 1963 gegründeten algerischen Fußballverband mit; in die französischen Profiligen kehrte nur eine Minderheit von ihnen zurück. Wegen dieser personellen Kontinuität gilt die FLN-Auswahl als legitimer Vorgänger der \\"Fennecs\\", der offiziellen Nationalmannschaft des Landes, als die sie zahlreiche Algerier auch damals schon ansahen., Historischer Hintergrund., Algerien war seit der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts ein Teil der französischen Kolonialbesitzungen in Nordafrika; da es Hauptziel der Immigration von Festlandsfranzosen –aber auch zahlreicher Spanier und Italiener– war, wurde das Gebiet politisch und verwaltungsmäßig zunehmend enger an Frankreich angebunden. Die an der Mittelmeerküste gelegenen Siedlungskerne Algier, Oran, Constantine und Bône wurden zu Hauptorten und Präfektursitzen von vier Départements, die als „französisches Algerien“ \\"(Algérie française)\\" integraler Bestandteil des französischen Staates waren. Innerhalb der algerischen Gesellschaft dominierten die Angehörigen der europäischen Einwanderer, in Frankreich als Algerienfranzosen bzw. Pieds-Noirs \\"(„Schwarzfüße“)\\" bezeichnet; auch die Zivilverwaltung und die Besatzungsarmee standen fest unter europäischer Kontrolle., \\"Die „Nationale Befreiungsfront“ FLN war die aus der paramilitärischen Organisation Spéciale (OS) von 1947 und dem Comité révolutionnaire dunité et daction (CRUA) von 1954 entstandene Nachfolgeorganisation, die einen Plan für den Unabhängigkeitskrieg gegen Frankreich ausarbeiten und dabei die strukturellen und strategischen Fehler der vorangegangenen Jahre vermeiden wollte.\\", Wenngleich der Beginn des Algerienkriegs bereits auf 1954 zu datieren ist, nahmen die militärischen Auseinandersetzungen zwischen bewaffneten Kräften des einheimischen FLN und der französischen Armee nach der Schlacht von Algier (1957) eine neue Qualität an. Die Brutalität der „antirevolutionären Kriegführung“ unter General Salan und die Repressionsmaßnahmen der Verwaltungsorgane verstärkten die Unterstützung weiter Teile der Bevölkerung für den FLN. Der Konflikt wirkte sich auf alle Lebensbereiche aus: so explodierte am 10.Februar 1957 unter anderem eine Bombe im Fußballstadion von El Biar und tötete acht Fans, woraufhin französische Zuschauer drei Algerier lynchten. Überlagert wurde dieser Kolonialkrieg von einem blutigen „Bruderkonflikt“ zwischen dem FLN und dem Mouvement National Algérien (MNA) unter Messali Hadj, der hauptsächlich in Frankreich selbst ausgetragen wurde. So tötete ein FLN-Mitglied den wegen seiner moderaten Haltung als „Verräter“ bezeichneten Nationalversammlungsabgeordneten Ali Chekkal am 26.Mai 1957, während dieser auf der Haupttribüne des Pariser Olympiastadions an der Seite von Staatspräsident René Coty dem französischen Pokalfinale beiwohnte., Der auch für Frankreich schmerzhafte Prozess der Entkolonialisierung als Folge des Indochinakriegs –von der militärischen Niederlage in Vietnam (1954) über die Unabhängigkeit Marokkos und Tunesiens hin zur Suezkrise (1956)– beschleunigte das Ende der Vierten Republik; am 1.Juni 1958 wurde Charles de Gaulle zum Ministerpräsidenten mit außerordentlichen Vollmachten gewählt. Ende 1958 scheiterte eine UN-Resolution zugunsten der algerischen Unabhängigkeit noch knapp an der erforderlichen Zweidrittelmehrheit (35:18 bei 28 Enthaltungen); zwei Jahre später hingegen wurde ein entsprechender Beschluss gefasst (63:8 bei 27 Enthaltungen). Im September 1959 kündigte de Gaulle an, Algerien die Selbstbestimmung zu gewähren; ab Juni 1960 begannen Verhandlungen mit Vertretern der provisorischen Regierung Algeriens in Melun. Auch wenn es dagegen sowohl in Frankreich als auch bei Teilen insbesondere der nicht-arabischen Bevölkerung Algeriens erhebliche Widerstände gab –beispielsweise bildete sich im Januar 1961 die prokoloniale Untergrundorganisation OAS, die erstmals im April des Jahres gegen de Gaulles Politik putschte–, schritt dieser Prozess voran., Mit dem Inkrafttreten der Verträge von Évian nach positivem Ausgang der Referenden in Frankreich (8.April 1962, 91 % Ja-Stimmen) und Algerien (3.Juli 1962, 99,7 %) endete die französische Herrschaft; dies war auch der Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Fußballauswahl des FLN aufgelöst wurde. An ihre Stelle trat die algerische Nationalmannschaft, die im Januar 1963 ihr erstes offizielles Länderspiel bestritt, nachdem der nationale Fußballverband Fédération Algérienne de Football in den Weltfußballverband FIFA aufgenommen worden war., Algerier im französischen Berufsfußball., Der Fußball gehörte in Algerien bereits im ersten Drittel des 20. Jahrhunderts zu den bevorzugten Sportarten, und das nicht nur bei den europäischen Einwanderern, sondern auch in der autochthonen Bevölkerung. So gab es 1934 in den algerisch-französischen Départements mehr registrierte Spieler als im Großraum Paris. Schon seit dem Ersten Weltkrieg waren zahlreiche Fußballer aus Nordafrika von den großen Vereinen Frankreichs verpflichtet worden. Olympique Marseille etwa galt in den 1930er Jahren als „Filiale Algeriens“, wofür spätere Nationalspieler wie Joseph Alcazar, Emmanuel Aznar, Abdelkader Ben Bouali und Mario Zatelli als bekannteste Beispiele stehen. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg bedienten sich Frankreichs Profiklubs verstärkt im Maghreb; wie schon in den 1930er Jahren zog es die neu Verpflichteten ganz überwiegend zu südfranzösischen Vereinen, und in der Mehrzahl handelte es sich um Offensivspieler. Dass Nordafrikaner als französische Staatsangehörige galten, erleichterte den Klubs die Einhaltung der vom Verband vorgeschriebenen Beschränkung auf anfänglich zwei Ausländer pro Mannschaft. Dazu kam, dass sie ihnen in der Regel weniger bezahlen mussten und dafür qualitativ mindestens gleichwertige Spieler bekamen: 1954 schlug eine Nordafrika-Auswahl Frankreichs A-Nationalelf im Pariser Prinzenparkstadion mit 3:2, wobei mit Abderrahman Mahjoub und Abdelaziz Ben Tifour zwei Maghrebiner den blauen Dress der Franzosen trugen, während der französische Nationalspieler Larbi Ben Barek als Kapitän der Nordafrika-Auswahl fungierte. Auch die Tatsache, dass der bescheidene algerische Amateurligist \\"SCU El Biar\\" die zu europäischer Bedeutung aufgestiegene und in Bestbesetzung angetretene Erstligaelf von Stade Reims 1957 aus dem französischen Pokalwettbewerb zu eliminieren vermochte, ist ein Indiz für die Existenz eines beachtlichen Talentreservoirs an der Südküste des Mittelmeeres., Von den 40 nordafrikanischen Spielern, die zwischen 1945 und 1955 in Frankreich unter Vertrag genommen wurden, waren 23 Algerier. 1956 und 1957 nahm ihre Zahl stark zu, um ab 1958 rapide zurückzugehen (siehe Tabelle rechts). Hingegen wurden, von einzelnen Ausnahmen abgesehen, Fußballer aus den frankophonen Teilen Subsahara-Afrika, insbesondere Französisch-Westafrika, erst ab Mitte der 1950er verpflichtet und machten erst ab Mitte der 1960er mehr als ein Drittel aller ausländischen Spieler aus., Zu Beginn des 21.Jahrhunderts sind es eher die algerischstämmigen Angehörigen der zweiten und dritten Immigrantengeneration wie Zinédine Zidane oder, noch aktueller, Samir Nasri und Karim Benzema, die die Bedeutung Algeriens für den französischen Profifußball veranschaulichen. Erstligaspieler, die ausschließlich die algerische Staatsbürgerschaft besaßen und von einem dortigen Verein kamen, gab es 1991 lediglich noch zwei. Auch diese gegenwärtigen Beispiele bestätigen allerdings, dass die beiden obigen Aussagen über die frühen Jahre weiterhin zutreffen, wonach das algerische Erbe vor allem im südlichen Frankreich und, fußballerisch, im Offensivbereich anzutreffen ist., Entstehung des FLN-Teams., Die Planungsphase., Im Herbst 1957, nach der Schlacht von Algier, beschloss die Leitung des FLN, eine „algerische Nationalmannschaft“ aufzubauen, um damit in anderen Staaten für die Unabhängigkeit Algeriens zu werben. Sie sollte auf dem sportlichen Sektor ergänzen, was durch die Gründung autonomer algerischer Organisationen in anderen Bereichen (Militär, Gewerkschaften, Studentenverband, Kulturvereine) zuvor bereits gelungen war: den Nachweis zu erbringen, dass das Land zu einer eigenständigen Entwicklung fähig war, und zugleich die Voraussetzungen für ein funktionierendes Gemeinwesen nach dem „Sieg der Revolution“ zu schaffen. Zudem erhoffte man sich positive Auswirkungen auf die Moral der eigenen Bevölkerung. Dazu schien es erforderlich, eine wirklich spielstarke Elf zusammenzustellen, weshalb sie aus Profis bestehen sollte. Dabei betrachtete eine Strömung innerhalb der FLN-Führung den Fußballsport, insbesondere den professionellen, als „Teil des kolonialherrschaftlichen Erbes“, der die kulturelle Hegemonie Frankreichs sichern helfe., Im Endergebnis konnte sich diese Position allerdings nicht durchsetzen. Das offizielle FLN-Kommuniqué vom 15.April 1958 betonte vielmehr die Bedeutung einer erfolgreichen Mannschaft für die Herausbildung einer „nationalen Identität“ und lobte die Spieler als „konsequente Patrioten, die die Unabhängigkeit ihres Vaterlands über alles andere stellen und der algerischen Jugend ein Beispiel von Mut, Rechtschaffenheit und Selbstlosigkeit geben“., Mit der Aufgabe, die Spieler auszuwählen, wurde Mohamed Boumezrag betraut, zu dieser Zeit eines der Vorstandsmitglieder des algerischen Regionalverbandes der Fédération Française de Football (FFF), der sie später auch trainierte und während der Reisen betreute. Politisch war seitens des FLN Mohamed Allam für die Planung und Geheimhaltung während der Aufbauphase, danach für die Reiselogistik und den Schutz der Spieler verantwortlich.

In der Neurobiologie wird für G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren häufig der Begriff metabotrope Rezeptoren verwendet, um sie von einem anderen Rezeptortyp, den ligandengesteuerten Ionenkanälen (Ionotroper Rezeptor), zu unterscheiden. Diese Unterscheidung ist jedoch nicht ausreichend trennscharf, denn auch enzym-gekoppelte Rezeptoren gehören zu den metabotropen Rezeptoren., Die Familie der G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren stellt mit mehr als 1000 verschiedenen Mitgliedern die größte Proteinsuperfamilie dar. G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren sind für die Verarbeitung von Licht-, Geruchs- und einer Vielzahl von Geschmacksreizen verantwortlich. Sie spielen eine entscheidende Rolle bei Entzündungsprozessen, der gezielten Zellbewegung (Taxis), dem Transport von Stoffen durch die Zellmembran (Endozytose und Exozytose) sowie beim Zellwachstum und bei der Zelldifferenzierung. Sie sind darüber hinaus als Zielstrukturen für die Wirkung von Hormonen, wie Adrenalin oder Glucagon, und Neurotransmittern, wie Serotonin und Acetylcholin, verantwortlich. Auch einige Viren nutzen G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren als Bindungsstellen für den Eintritt in die Zelle (beispielsweise HIV)., Definition., Als G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren im engeren Sinn werden alle heptahelikalen, das heißt mit 7 Helices in der Zellmembran verankerten Rezeptoren bezeichnet, die zur Bindung und Aktivierung von G-Proteinen befähigt sind. Zusätzlich zur Bindung von G-Proteinen sind viele dieser Rezeptoren in der Lage, auch mit anderen signalweiterleitenden Proteinen zu interagieren. Als G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren werden, wie im Fall vieler sogenannter „Orphan-GPCRs“, auch Rezeptorproteine bezeichnet, für die eine Kopplung mit G-Proteinen lediglich vermutet wird. Bisweilen wird dieser Begriff auch auf Rezeptoren angewandt, die zwar nicht zur Bindung und Aktivierung von G-Proteinen befähigt sind, jedoch auf Grund ihrer phylogenetischen Verwandtschaft mit anderen, der klassischen Definition genügenden G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren dieser Familie zugerechnet werden können., Dem gegenüber werden prokaryotische Rhodopsine, die zwar in ihrer Struktur eukaryotischen G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren ähneln, aber nicht zur Bindung von G-Proteinen befähigt sind und als Ionenkanäle fungieren, nicht der Familie der G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren zugeordnet., Vorkommen., G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren kommen in fast allen Lebewesen vor. Besonders zahlreich sind sie bei Wirbeltieren zu finden. Aber auch Wirbellose, Protozoen (z.B. Amöben) und Pilze (beispielsweise in Hefen) besitzen G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren. Auch einige pflanzliche Zellmembranproteine können auf Grund ihrer Fähigkeit, heterotrimäre G-Proteine zu aktivieren, den G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren zugerechnet werden. Sie spielen insbesondere eine Rolle als Phytohormon-Rezeptoren. Allerdings sind nicht alle dieser pflanzlichen Rezeptoren wie der GCR1 der Acker-Schmalwand klassische heptahelikale G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren, sondern können wie GCR2, der größere Ähnlichkeiten zu bakteriellen Lanthionin-Synthasen besitzt, abweichende Strukturmotive besitzen. Einige Fotorezeptoren mit einer Struktur, die G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren ähnelt, können sogar in Archaeen gefunden werden (Bacteriorhodopsine). Diese als Ionenkanäle fungierenden Rezeptoren haben jedoch keine Verwandtschaft zu Fotorezeptoren höherer Tiere und werden in der Regel nicht der Familie der G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren zugerechnet., Beim Menschen konnten bisher etwa 800 G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren identifiziert werden. Diese werden durch etwa 3 % des menschlichen Genoms kodiert. Mehr als die Hälfte der G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren des Menschen werden den Geruchsrezeptoren (olfaktorischen Rezeptoren) zugeordnet. Bei über 140 der ca. 800 G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren ist der endogene Ligand nicht bekannt und sie werden deshalb als \\"Orphan-GPCRs\\" bezeichnet., Struktur., Auf Grund ihrer Struktur gehören mit Ausnahme des pflanzlichen GCR2 alle G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren der Superfamilie der heptahelikalen Transmembranproteine (gebräuchliche Synonyme: Sieben-Transmembrandomänen-Rezeptoren, 7-TM-Rezeptoren und heptahelikale Rezeptoren) an. Sie bestehen aus Untereinheiten mit sieben (griechisch „\\"hepta\\"“) die Zellmembran durchspannenden (transmembranären) Helixstrukturen, die durch drei intrazelluläre und drei extrazelluläre Schleifen miteinander verbunden sind. G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren besitzen eine extrazelluläre oder transmembranäre Bindungsdomäne für einen Liganden. Das G-Protein bindet an der zellinneren (intrazellulären) Seite des Rezeptors. Zum Vergleich des Aufbaus der verschiedenen G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren untereinander wurde das Ballesteros-Weinstein-System der Nomenklatur entwickelt., Lange Zeit konnte die Struktur G-Protein-gekoppelter Rezeptoren nur anhand der Analogie zur bekannten Struktur des Bakteriorhodopsins vorausgesagt werden. Die dreidimensionale Strukturaufklärung eines G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptors bei Wirbeltieren, des Rhodopsins des Hausrinds, gelang im Jahr 2000 mit Hilfe der Röntgenstrukturanalyse. Die Kristallisierung und Strukturaufklärung anderer G-Protein-gekoppelter Rezeptoren ist hingegen wegen ihrer physikochemischen Eigenschaften und aufgrund der geringen Rezeptordichte in der Membran erschwert. Daher konnte erst im Jahr 2007 die Kristallstruktur eines ligandenaktivierten G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptors (menschlicher β2-Adrenozeptor) unter Verwendung technischer Tricks, wie der Verwendung stabilisierender Antikörper oder der Fusion mit leicht zu kristallisierenden Proteinen, aufgeklärt werden., Inzwischen wurde die dreidimensionale Struktur, einschließlich die der Transmembrandomänen, für zahlreiche G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren der physiologisch und therapeutisch bedeutsamen Klasse A aufgeklärt. Die Strukturaufklärung erfolgte überwiegend mit Hilfe der Röntgenkristallanalyse unter Verwendung von Fusionsproteinen oder Methoden zur thermischen Stabilisierung. Auf diese Weise wurde unter anderem die Struktur des β1-Adrenozeptors, des A2A-Adenosinrezeptors, des D3-Dopaminrezeptors, der Opioidrezeptoren κ, μ, δ, Nociceptin, des S1P1-Rezeptors, der muskarinischen Acetylcholinrezeptoren M2 und M3, des Histamin-H1-Rezeptors, der Serotonin-Rezeptoren 5-HT1B und 5-HT2B, der Chemokinrezeptoren CCR5 und CXCR4, des Neurotensinrezeptors NTS1 und des Protease-aktivierten Rezeptors PAR1 aufgeklärt. Mittels Kernspinresonanzspektroskopie wurde die dreidimensionale Struktur des natürlichen humanen Chemokinrezeptors CXCR1 ermittelt. Genutzt werden die Flüssig- und Festphasenspektroskopie., Für G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren der Klasse A liegen Strukturdaten der Rezeptoren in Komplex mit Signaltransduktionsmolekülen, wie beispielsweise heterotrimäre G-Proteine und Arrestin, und für verschiedene Aktivierungszustände vor. Diese Daten liefern einen wichtigen Einblick in den molekularen Mechanismus der Rezeptoraktivierung und der Signalweiterleitung., Von den G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren der Klasse B liegen die Strukturdaten für den Corticotropin-Releasing-Hormon-Rezeptor1 und den Glucagonrezeptor vor. Von den Rhodopsin-ähnlichen G-Protein-gekoppelten-Rezeptoren der KlasseA unterscheidet sich der bisher einzige strukturaufgeklärte G-Protein-Rezeptor der KlasseF, der Smoothened-Rezeptor, durch ein Fehlen vieler typischer Strukturmotive und durch ausgeprägte extrazelluläre Schleifen., Für zahlreiche weitere G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren konnten zumindest Teile der Struktur, wie beispielsweise die der extrazellulären Domänen, experimentell bestimmt werden., Auch die Sonderrolle des pflanzlichen Phytohormonrezeptors GCR2 unter den G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren konnte mit Hilfe der Röntgenstrukturanalyse bestätigt werden. Zwar wurde er auf Grund biochemischer Voraussagen und der Aktivierung durch das Phytohormon Abscisinsäure der Gruppe der G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren zugeordnet, besitzt aber wesentlich abweichende physikochemische Eigenschaften. Mit seinen identifizierten 14 Helices ist er der einzige bekannte nicht heptahelikale G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptor und ähnelt strukturell eher bakteriellen Lanthionin-Synthasen., Transmembrandomänen., Die sieben membrandurchspannenden helikalen Domänen G-Protein-gekoppelter Rezeptoren, die bei Sicht auf den Rezeptor von der extrazellulären Seite aus entgegen dem Uhrzeigersinn angeordnet sind, betten sich aufgrund ihrer überwiegend lipophilen Außenoberfläche in eine Lipidmembran wie die Zellmembran ein. Das obere Drittel des Rezeptors beherbergt über den Kontakt zu den Transmembrandomänen III, V und VI die Bindungsstelle für einen primären (orthosterischen) Liganden, mit der Ausnahme, dass dieselbe Bindungsstelle in GPCR der Klasse C (GPCR-C) eine allosterische ist., Im Gegensatz zu den extrazellulären und intrazellulären Domänen sind die Transmembrandomänen innerhalb der Familie G-Protein-gekoppelter Rezeptoren stark konserviert. Einige Aminosäuresequenzen (Motive) innerhalb der Transmembrandomänen sind für viele G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren charakteristisch. Beispielsweise können das E/DRY-Motiv der Transmembrandomäne III und das NPxxY-Motiv der Transmembrandomäne VII in fast allen Rhodopsin-ähnlichen Rezeptoren gefunden werden. Ihnen wird eine wichtige Rolle bei der Rezeptoraktivierung zugeschrieben., Am Beispiel des MOR ist die Modulation eines GPCR durch Ionen seit 1973 bekannt. Die im Kern von 70 bis 90 % der GPCR-A befindliche Natriumbindungsstelle ist hoch konserviert und weit überwiegend verankert über die saure Aminosäure Aspartat in der Position D2.50. In dieser Bindungsstelle stabilisiert ein einzelnes Natriumkation antagonistische Rezeptorzustände, vermag andererseits aber auch die Efficacy von Vollagonisten zu erhöhen. Das Ion wird durch Aktivierung verdrängt, wobei die Bindungsstelle kollabiert.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"GPCR, Neurochemie, Signaltransduktion, Rezeptortyp, ligandengesteuerte Ionenkanäle, metabotrope Rezeptoren, Proteinsuperfamilie, Hormone, Neurotransmitter, Fotorezeptoren"},{"instruction":"Puedes explicarme esto mejor?A partir de la época de la segunda posguerra cuando se impone la necesidad de afinar las decisiones y las formas de intervención públicas, como una manera de cumplir con la responsabilidad de garantizar la «procura existencial», entendida como un proceso que extiende la protección social a todos los ciudadanos Sólo la burocratización del Estado y del derecho reconoce en general la definitiva posibilidad de una rigurosa distinción conceptual entre un orden jurídico ‹objetivo› y los derechos ‹subjetivos› de los individuos por él garantizados (…) la burocratización presupone la separación abstracta entre el ‹Estado› en cuanto sostén abstracto de los derechos de mando y creador de ‹normas jurídicas›, y todas las atribuciones personales de los individuos»","output":"Este texto está hablando sobre la necesidad de mejorar la toma de decisiones y la intervención del gobierno después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

Obwohl seine Gestalt an die Antilopen Afrikas und Asiens erinnert, gehört er nicht zu deren Familie der Hornträger. Er bildet die heute monotypische Familie der \\"Gabelhornträger\\" (Antilocapridae) als ihr einziger rezenter Vertreter., Merkmale., Habitus., Der Gabelbock ist etwa so groß wie ein Damhirsch. Er hat eine Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von bis zu 150 Zentimetern (der Schwanz ist 8 bis 15cm lang), eine Körperhöhe von 90 Zentimetern und ein Gewicht von 50 bis 70 Kilogramm. Die Männchen sind etwas größer als die Weibchen (Sexualdimorphismus). Das Fell ist oberseits gelb- bis rotbraun und unterseits bis zu den Flanken weiß gefärbt; weiße Bänder finden sich zudem auf der Vorderseite des Halses und um das Maul herum. Die Männchen haben außerdem eine schwarze Zeichnung im Gesicht und am Hals. Ein Gabelbock kann seine Körperhaare aufrichten. Durch das Aufstellen der weißen Rumpfhaare gibt er ein weithin sichtbares Signal, das in einer Herde als Warnung wahrgenommen wird., Unterscheidbar sind die Geschlechter auch durch die Hörner. Beim Männchen können sie bis zu 25cm lang werden (meist sind sie doppelt so lang wie die Ohren) und gabeln sich in ein kurzes nach vorne gerichtetes und ein langes nach oben gerichtetes und etwas zurückgebogenes Ende – von dieser Eigenschaft leitet sich ihr deutscher Name ab. Weibchen haben oft gar keine Hörner; falls doch, dann sind diese niemals länger als die Ohren., Unter den Sinnesorganen des Gabelbocks kommt dem Auge die größte Bedeutung zu. Durch die Lage der Augen an den Kopfseiten hat ein Gabelbock die Möglichkeit, ein Blickfeld von nahezu 360° zu beobachten. Gehör- und Geruchssinn sind von etwas geringerer Bedeutung, beide sind aber dennoch gut entwickelt. Die Ohren können aufgestellt und in verschiedene Richtungen gewendet werden. Die Nase spielt vor allem beim Erkennen von Reviergrenzen eine Rolle., Anders als bei anderen Paarhufern fehlen die Afterklauen vollständig, die Gliedmaßen tragen also nur die dritte und die vierte Zehe., Gabelböcke zeichnen sich durch eine außergewöhnliche Sprungkraft aus. So können sie mit einem einzigen Sprung bis zu sechs Meter vorwärts schnellen., Schädel- und Gebissmerkmale., Der Gabelbock besitzt ein reduziertes Gebiss: im Unterkiefer sind je Kieferhälfte 3 Schneidezähne, 1 Eckzahn, 3 Prämolaren und 3 Molaren ausgebildet, im Oberkiefer fehlen die Schneide- und Eckzähne. Die Zahnformel lautet somit formula_1, insgesamt sind also 32 Zähne ausgebildet. Die unteren Schneidezähne besitzen eine spachtelartige Form, ähnlich ist der Eckzahn gestaltet (\\"incisiform\\"). Die Backenzähne sind allgemein hochkronig (\\"hypsodont\\") und weisen auf den Kauflächen ein mondsichelartig geformtes (\\"selenodontes\\") Zahnschmelzmuster auf. Hervorzuheben ist vor allem die Hochkronigkeit, die teilweise jene der spezialisierten Grasfresser unter den Rindern übertrifft., Hörner., Eine Besonderheit stellen die Hörner dar, die direkt oberhalb des Augenfensters ansetzen. Wie die der Hornträger bestehen sie aus einer knöchernen Grundlage (Schaft), die mit Keratin überzogen ist (Hornscheide). Dabei gabelt sich der Hornschaft beim heutigen Gabelbock selber nicht, nur der Keratinüberzug bildet die beiden Hornspitzen aus. Jedes Jahr werden die Hornscheiden nach der Brunft etwa ab Oktober gewechselt. Nur die Knochenzapfen bleiben zeitlebens bestehen, während die Hornscheide sich ablöst und zu Boden fällt. Darunter hat sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits neue Hornmasse gebildet, die noch mit einem pelzigen Überzug bedeckt ist. Das jährliche Wachstum des Keratinüberzuges ist nach rund zehn Monaten abgeschlossen. In dieser Hinsicht ähnelt der Gabelbock den Hirschen, die ihr Geweih jährlich wechseln, weicht aber markant von den Hornträgern ab, bei denen es nicht zu einem Austausch der Hornscheide kommt. Fossile Vertreter der Gabelhornträger besaßen zum Teil sehr komplexe Hörner mit mehreren oder vielfach gegabelten beziehungsweise in sich gedrehten Schäften. Hier ist unklar, ob es ebenfalls zu einem jährlichen Abrieb der Hornscheide kam. Einige Experten sehen darin ein besonderes Merkmal des heute lebenden Gabelbocks. Die frühesten Gabelhornträger besaßen noch mit Haut überzogene Hörner, was anhand von Blutkanälchen an den Hornschäften nachgewiesen wurde. Allgemein wird das Wachstum der Hörner – wie bei anderen Stirnwaffenträgern auch – gesteuert über Gene, die für die Bildung von Haut, Knochen und Nerven verantwortlich sind., Verbreitung., Der Gabelbock entwickelte sich in den Grasländern Nordamerikas und war einst weit über die Prärie und auch in den Wüsten und Halbwüsten der südwestlichen USA sowie des nordwestlichen Mexiko verbreitet. Er bevorzugt Regionen mit weitem Sichtfeld und einer mosaikartigen Vegetation aus offenen Steppen- und Staudenlandschaften. Ursprünglich über weite Bereiche der Großen Ebenen bis hin zum Saskatchewan River im Norden verbreitet, ist er seit der Besiedlung Nordamerikas durch die Europäer in höhere Gebirgslagen des westlichen Kontinentalteiles zurückgedrängt worden. In den Rocky Mountains kommt er bis in Höhen von 3350 m vor. Generell meidet der Gabelbock geschlossenere Landschaften (\\"siehe auch:\\" Bedrohung und Schutz)., Lebensweise., Gabelböcke können zu allen Tages- und Nachtzeiten aktiv sein, sind dies jedoch überwiegend während der Dämmerung. Wo die Umstände es erforderlich machen, führen sie jahreszeitliche Wanderungen durch, die über Strecken von bis zu 260 Kilometern führen können. Dies ist beispielsweise in Wüsten notwendig, um Wasserläufe zu suchen, oder in felsigen Gegenden, die im Winter kein ausreichendes Nahrungsangebot haben. Die weitesten untersuchten Wanderungen führen aus dem Grand-Teton-Nationalpark über die Gros Ventre Range zum Oberlauf des Green Rivers in Wyoming., Im Sommer werden ältere Männchen zu Einzelgängern und versuchen, durch Kämpfe ein Territorium zu erstreiten. In diesem sammeln sie einen Harem um sich. Ein Territorium kann vier Quadratkilometer umfassen und wird durch Urin markiert und somit abgesteckt. Das Männchen ist fortan damit beschäftigt, andere Männchen am Betreten und Weibchen am Verlassen des Territoriums zu hindern. Bei einem Aufeinandertreffen zweier Männchen reichen meistens Drohgebärden mit lauten Schreien und Scheinattacken aus, um über Sieger und Verlierer zu entscheiden. Kommt es doch einmal zum Kampf, können die scharfkantigen Hörner ernsthafte Verletzungen und sogar den Tod verursachen., Im Herbst und im Winter tun sich all die kleinen Verbände mit einzelgängerischen Männchen zu großen Herden zusammen, die in historischen Zeiten mehrere zehntausend Tiere umfassen konnten, heute jedoch maximal aus wenig mehr als 1000 Tieren bestehen., Jüngere Männchen, die noch nicht kämpfen können, finden sich zu kleinen Verbänden zusammen; alte Männchen, die zu schwach zum Kämpfen geworden sind, bleiben einzelgängerisch und versuchen, den Revieren der Artgenossen auszuweichen. Die Weibchen leben in Gruppen von etwa 20 Tieren. Nach einer Tragzeit von achteinhalb Monaten sondert sich das Weibchen von der Herde ab und bringt ein bis zwei, sehr selten drei Junge mit einem Geburtsgewicht von etwa drei Kilogramm zur Welt. Diese haben zunächst ein graues Fell, das nach drei Monaten die typischen Farben der Alttiere annimmt. Die ersten drei Tage werden sie in einem Versteck gehalten, und etwa nach einer Woche können junge Gabelböcke selbst rennen. Obwohl sie schon nach drei Wochen Gras zu sich nehmen, werden sie noch fünf bis sechs Monate lang gesäugt. Die Geschlechtsreife erreichen die Weibchen mit 15 bis 16, die Männchen mit etwa 24 Monaten., Gabelböcke haben eine geringe Lebenserwartung und werden selbst unter günstigen Umständen selten älter als zehn Jahre., Ernährung., Der Gabelbock ist stark wählerisch in seinem Nahrungsverhalten. Generell ernährt er sich von verschiedenen Pflanzen, vor allem von Kräutern, Blättern, Sprossen und Gräsern. Häufig verbringt ein Tier nur relativ kurze Zeit, etwa eine halbe Minute, an einer Nahrungsressource. Vor allem im Frühjahr und zu Beginn des Sommers bevorzugt der Gabelbock Gras, während er im Herbst und Winter Blätter an Stauden frisst. Bedeutend sind hierbei vor allem \\"Artemisia\\"-Gewächse. In Trockenlandschaften bilden zudem Kakteen einen Teil der Ernährungsgrundlage., Geschwindigkeit., Im Laufen können Gabelböcke Geschwindigkeiten von 60 bis 70km/h erreichen; anhand von gemessenen Schrittlängen wurde sogar eine Geschwindigkeit von 86,5km/h angenommen. Derart hohe Geschwindigkeiten können über eine Strecke von bis zu fünf Kilometern durchgehalten werden. Eine Distanz von 11 Kilometern können sie in 10Minuten bei einer Durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit von 65km/h überwinden. Die Tiere sind also eher Langstreckenläufer als Sprinter. Die körperliche Anpassung an solche Geschwindigkeiten besteht nicht nur in dem schlanken Körperbau und den kräftigen Beinen, sondern auch in einer Vergrößerung von Lungen und Herz – das Herz eines Gabelbocks ist etwa doppelt so groß wie das eines Hausschafs. Weitere Anpassungen bestehen beispielsweise in einer erhöhten Anzahl der Mitochondrien pro Muskelvolumen. Es sind solche Verstärkungen der allgemeinen Säugetierstrukturen – und nicht die Entwicklung neuer Strukturen –, die es dem Gabelbock ermöglichen, einen höheren Sauerstoffanteil aus der Atemluft aufzunehmen und zu verwerten, als es für ein Säugetier seiner Größe zu erwarten ist., Oft stößt man auf die Aussage, Gabelböcke seien nach dem Gepard die schnellsten Säugetiere der Welt. Hier ist aber die Frage, ob die Höchst- oder die Durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit gemeint ist. Über sehr kurze Distanzen können manche afrikanisch-asiatische Antilopen, wie zum Beispiel die Hirschziegenantilope, die gleiche Geschwindigkeit erreichen. Allerdings sind Gabelböcke die schnellsten Säugetiere des amerikanischen Doppelkontinents und, gemessen über eine Strecke von fünf Kilometern, wahrscheinlich sogar die schnellsten Sä: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Gabelbock, Gabelhornantilope, Wiederkäuer, Prärie, Sonora-Wüste, Gestalt, Antilopen, Hornträger, Hörner, Sinnesorganen, Gebissmerkmale"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Aufgelöst 1917, Fotoausstellung, Fotografie (Vereinigte Staaten), Galerie in den Vereinigten Staaten, Gegründet 1905, Kultur (New York City)], Die Galerie 291 oder kurz \\"291\\" war eine avantgardistische Kunstgalerie in der Fifth Avenue in New York. Sie wurde 1905 als \\"Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession\\" von den US-amerikanischen Fotografen Alfred Stieglitz und Edward Steichen gegründet. Die \\"291\\" zeigte neben fotografischen Arbeiten auch afrikanische Kunst und präsentierte erstmals europäische Künstler der Moderne in den Vereinigten Staaten. Ihr Galerist Alfred Stieglitz war eine Schlüsselfigur in der Fotografie- und Kunstgeschichte und einer der ersten modernen Ausstellungsmacher. Die Galerie und ihre Hauszeitschriften \\"Camera Work\\" und \\"291\\" waren wichtige Künstlerforen und impulsgebend für prädadaistische Tendenzen, den New-York-Dada und die darauf folgende Entstehung erster moderner Kunstrichtungen in den Vereinigten Staaten des frühen 20.Jahrhunderts., Geschichte., \\"Photo-Secession\\", \\"Camera Work\\" und der Piktorialismus., Die Entstehungsgeschichte der Galerie ist eng mit der Photo-Secession verbunden, einer Fotografenvereinigung, die 1902 von Stieglitz gemeinsam mit seinem Protegé, dem Maler und Fotografen Edward Steichen, nach dem Vorbild der Londoner Brotherhood of the Linked Ring als „elitärer Club“ gegründet wurde. Der Begriff „Secession“ spielte auf die Künstler der Wiener Secession an, die sich vom akademischen Establishment abgespalten hatten. Stieglitz sah die Secession als „Protest und Spaltung vom Geist der Doktrinären und der Kompromissler.“ Die Photo-Secession nahm von 1902 bis 1904 Gestalt an. Die ersten Mitglieder waren, neben Steichen und Stieglitz, international namhafte Fotografen des Piktorialismus wie Frank Eugene, Gertrude Käsebier, Joseph Keiley und Clarence Hudson White. Etwas später schlossen sich Anne Brigman, Alvin Langdon Coburn und George Henry Seeley an. Begleitend gab Stieglitz das aufwändig gestaltete, im teuren Heliogravüre-Verfahren produzierte Hochglanzmagazin \\"Camera Work\\" heraus, um die Fotografien der Photo-Secessionisten und den von ihm proklamierten Piktorialismus zu verbreiten. Das Magazin erschien vierteljährlich von 1902 bis 1917 mit insgesamt 50 Ausgaben und diente Stieglitz bis zur Schließung der Galerie als „Hauszeitschrift“, die neben Essays und Theorieentwicklung zur Fotografie aktuelle Exponate vorstellte. Neben der Analyse fotografischer Arbeiten der Secessionisten boten die frühen Ausgaben wissenschaftliche Artikel und naturalistische Fotografien, spätere Ausgaben konzentrierten sich auf ebenso applaudierende wie harte Kunstkritiken der von Stieglitz organisierten Ausstellungen., Gründung., Die Wanderausstellungen der Photo-Secessionisten und \\"Camera Work\\" wurden mit großem Zuspruch angenommen. Dennoch sah Stieglitz seine Position als Leitfigur der Fotografengemeinde ernsthaft gefährdet, als der professionelle Fotograf Curtis Bell, der zugleich Präsident der \\"American Federation of Photographic Societies\\" war, im Dezember 1904 die Ausstellung \\"The First American Photographic Salon\\" in der New Yorker Clausen Gallery veranstaltete. Das Ausstellungskuratorium bestand aus namhaften Künstlern wie William Merritt Chase, Kenyon Cox und Robert Henri; die Schau präsentierte amerikanische und europäische Fotografen und wurde von vielen als direkter Angriff auf Stieglitz’ Vorherrschaft betrachtet. Stieglitz sah sich nun genötigt, sich und die Photo-Secession „von der Mittelmäßigkeit und Selbstgefälligkeit, die die künstlerische Fotografie bedrohen“, loszulösen., 5th Avenue 291 und 293., 1902 kehrte Edward Steichen aus Paris nach New York zurück und mietete im obersten Stock des Gebäudes an der Fifth Avenue Nummer 291, zwischen 30. und 31. Straße, ein kleines Studio. Das Haus, um 1870 im Stil des Neoklassizismus gebaut, war vierstöckig, aus braunem Klinker (Brownstone) ausgeführt und schloss oben mit einer prägnanten Attika, als Aufkantung des Flachdachrandes, ab. Im ersten und zweiten Stock war ein Erker (bay window) mit großen Fenstern vorgebaut. Die nebeneinander liegenden Häuser 291 und 293 verband ein großer Hausflur (Hallway), ein kleiner, „klappriger“ Aufzug konnte dadurch von beiden Häusern benutzt werden. Die Häuser wurden 1935 abgerissen und durch Neubauten ersetzt, die heute noch bestehen. Der Standort kam Steichen sehr entgegen, da der \\"Camera-Club\\" ganz in der Nähe in der 29. Straße eine gut ausgerüstete Dunkelkammer, seine Versammlungsräume und seine Bibliothek hatte. 1905 zog Steichen, der inzwischen geheiratet und Kinder hatte – quer durch die Hallway – in größere Räume in das Haus Nummer 293., Dadurch wurde sein ehemaliges Studio frei und Stieglitz konnte es, auf Vermittlung von Steichen, für 50 Dollar im Monat mieten. Zusätzlich konnte er zwei zusätzliche Räume hinzunehmen, um dort eine Galerie, die er \\"The Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession\\" nannte, zu betreiben. Die von Steichen gestaltete Galerieräume wurde in der April-Ausgabe 1906 von Camera Work beschrieben:, Die Galerie bestand lediglich aus drei Räumen; der größte maß 4,50×5,10m, der mittlere 4,50×4,50m und der schmalste nur 4,50× 2,50m. In einem Leitartikel erklärte \\"Camera Work\\", dass „291 ein Laboratorium, eine Versuchsstation [sei] und nicht als Kunstgalerie im herkömmlichen Sinne angesehen werden darf.“, Aus der Befürchtung heraus, es gäbe nicht genügend fotografische Werke, um eine Galerie zu unterhalten, und mit dem Wunsch, Fotografie mit „den anderen Künsten“ zu vergleichen, entschieden sie sich, nicht nur die „allerbesten Fotografien der Welt“, sondern auch Malereien, Zeichnungen und Skulpturen zu zeigen und diese in Beziehung zueinander zu setzen. Die Galerie sollte zugleich ein kommerzieller Raum sein, obwohl Stieglitz eine ausgesprochene Abneigung gegen die Kommerzialisierung der Kunst sowie finanzielle Diskussionen im Allgemeinen hatte. Stieglitz betrachtete dies als eine Form der Prostitution, und wenn er bemerkte, dass jemand ein Kunstwerk wie ein Konsumgut behandelte, zögerte er nicht, plötzlich den doppelten Preis dafür zu verlangen., 1908 sollte die Miete für seine drei Räume in 5th Avenue 291 erheblich steigen. Stieglitz und seine Freunde von der Photo-Secession sah sich außerstande, diesen Betrag in Verbindung mit einem langfristigen Mietvertrag, aufzubringen. Der Kunstmäzen Paul Haviland half der Gruppe finanziell und Stieglitz konnte im Nachbarhaus 5th Avenue 293 einen dreijährigen Mietvertrag, wenn auch für kleinere Räume, abschließen. Der Umzug – wieder quer durch den Hallway – fand im Januar 1908 statt. Der neue Ausstellungsraum maß nur 4,60×4,60 m, umfasste jedoch auch kleinere Nebenräume. „Nachdem Haviland ihn davon überzeugt hatte, dass der neue Raum praktikabel war, trommelte Stieglitz einige andere Freunde zusammen und brachte zusätzliche Mittel für Betriebskosten, Material, Druck und Rahmung auf.“ Obwohl sich nun die Hausnummer in ”293“ geändert hatte, beschlossen die Freunde, die „291“ („two-nine-one“) weiterhin als Galeriename zu nutzen., Eröffnung, erste Ausstellungen 1905–1906., Die \\"Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession\\", die alsbald in \\"291\\" umbenannt wurde, eröffnete am 25. November 1905. Wie die Zeitschrift \\"Camera Work\\" sollte die Galerie den Piktorialisten ein Forum bieten, als Präsentationsfläche dienen und das Medium Fotografie als eigenständige Kunstform im Kunstbetrieb etablieren. Überdies sollten die Fotografien mit dem dezenten Hinweis „Preise auf Anfrage“ zum Verkauf angeboten werden., Die offizielle Eröffnungsausstellung im Januar 1906 präsentierte Gummibichromatdrucke der französischen Fotografen Robert Demachy, René Le Bègue und Constant Puyo. Der Ausstellung folgte eine Zwei-Personen-Schau mit Fotoarbeiten von Gertrude Käsebier und Clarence H. White, sowie vier weitere Ausstellungen im selben Jahr, in denen britische Fotografen gezeigt und erste Drucke von Edward Steichen vorgestellt wurden. Eine Schau war deutschen und österreichischen Fotografen gewidmet und eine weitere den Photo-Secessionisten., Richtungswandel zur Kunstgalerie der Moderne 1907–1908., Die Galerie beschränkte sich nur kurzfristig auf Einzel- und Gruppenausstellungen der Fotografen. Bereits im Januar 1907 zeigte Stieglitz Zeichnungen der englischen Illustratorin Pamela Colman Smith, die mit der Gestaltung des Waite-Smith Tarot bekannt wurde., Über Edward Steichen, der 1906 nach Paris zurückkehrte, entstanden viele wichtige Kontakt zur europäischen Avantgarde. Steichen lernte die meisten Künstler über die dort lebende einflussreiche amerikanische Sammlerfamilie Stein – Michael, Sarah, Leo und Gertrude Stein – kennen. Er erinnerte sich später „[…] bei den Steins sah ich sämtliche Arten der modernen Malerei, von Cézanne und Renoir bis zu Matisse und Picasso.“ Stieglitz bezeichnete Steichen einmal humorvoll als „seinen Kunst-Scout vor Ort“., Unter Steichens Einfluss zeigte die Galerie ab 1908 Werke der europäischen Künstler-Avantgarde wie Georges Braque, Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, Francis Picabia, Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec oder die Bildhauer Constantin Brâncuși und Auguste Rodin, sowie amerikanische Künstler die zeitweise in Europa arbeiteten, wie Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove oder Alfred Maurer., In einem Brief an Stieglitz regte Steichen von Paris aus an, „wir sollten die moderneren Werke rotieren lassen, sodass sowohl Fotografien als auch konventionelle, verständliche Kunstwerke gezeigt werden. Und als ‚rotes Tuch‘ könnten wir Picasso nehmen, um die Rechnung zu begleichen, wenn wir ihn bekommen, denn er ist ein verrückter Steinzeitmensch [,] hasst Ausstellungen etc. wie auch immer, wir werden es mit ihm versuchen.“, Die Ausstellungssaison 1907/08 begann Stieglitz mit einer Werkschau der Photo-Secessionisten, gefolgt von einer Ausstellung mit Rodins spontanen, minimalistischen Aquarellzeichnungen, die eine für die damalige Zeit schockierend sexuelle Thematik besaßen. Die 58 Zeichnungen wurden erstmals öffentlich gezeigt. Rodin hegte zwar kein besonderes Interesse an einer Werkschau in den Vereinigten Staaten, dennoch hatte Steichen ihn überreden können, die Arbeiten nach Übersee zu verschicken. Allgemein sahen die meisten europäischen Künstler zu der Zeit wenig Sinn darin, ihre Werke ohne Erfolgsbilanz und Aussicht auf gute Verkäufe an eine kleine amerikanische Galerie zu geben, und Rodin brauchte 1908 weder Geld noch Aufmerksamkeit, obgleich er wusste, dass er viele Bewunderer in den Staaten hatte. Stieglitz präsentierte Rodins Zeichnungen ungerahmt hinter Glas in den beiden schmaleren Räumen der Galerie. Im Frühjahr 1910 folgte eine weitere Rodin-Ausstellung mit 41 Zeichnung: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Galerie 291 - Fotografie - New York - Alfred Stieglitz - Photo-Secession - Künstlervereinigung - avantgardistisch - Kultur - moderne Kunst - Ausstellungen"},{"instruction":"How to use nanofluid and porous media to write a high-quality article in the field of parabolic solar collectors?","output":"Writing a high-quality article on the utilization of nanofluid and porous media in parabolic solar collectors requires a systematic approach.

Berühmt wurde er auch dadurch, dass die katholische Kirche ihn verurteilte, weil einige seiner Theorien der damaligen Weltsicht widersprachen; 1992 rehabilitierte sie ihn., Leben und Werk., Herkunft und Lehrjahre., Galileo Galilei stammte aus einer verarmten Florentiner Patrizierfamilie. Sein Familienzweig hatte den Namen eines bedeutenden Vorfahren angenommen, des Arztes Galileo Bonaiuti (15.Jahrhundert). Galileis Vater Vincenzo war vorübergehend nach der Heirat mit Giulia Ammannati (Pisa, 1562) Tuchhändler, ansonsten aber Musiker, Komponist und Musiktheoretiker und hatte mathematische Kenntnisse und Interessen; er lebte ab den 1570er Jahren ständig in Florenz. Dort untersuchte er unter anderem den Klang einer schwingenden Saite und entdeckte den quadratischen Zusammenhang zwischen den Veränderungen von Spannung bzw. Länge der Saite, wenn die Tonhöhe sich um ein bestimmtes Intervall ändern soll., Galilei wurde als Novize im Kloster der Vallombrosaner erzogen und zeigte Neigung, in den Benediktinerorden einzutreten, wurde aber von seinem Vater nach Hause geholt und 1580 zum Medizinstudium nach Pisa geschickt, wo sich Galileo 1581 einschrieb; dort war einer seiner Dozenten Andrea Camuzio., Nach vier Jahren brach er sein Studium ab und ging nach Florenz, um bei Ostilio Ricci, einem Gelehrten aus der Schule von Nicolo Tartaglia, Mathematik zu studieren. Er bestritt seinen Lebensunterhalt mit Privatunterricht, beschäftigte sich mit angewandter Mathematik, Mechanik und Hydraulik und begann, in den gebildeten Kreisen der Stadt mit Vorträgen und Manuskripten auf sich aufmerksam zu machen. Vor der Accademia Fiorentina glänzte er mit einem geometrisch-philologischen Referat über die Topografie von Dantes Hölle (\\"Due lezioni all’Accademia fiorentina circa la figura, sito e grandezza dell’Inferno di Dante,\\" 1588). 1585/86 veröffentlichte er erste Ergebnisse zur Schwere fester Körper \\"(Theoremata circa centrum gravitatis solidorum)\\" (in der Tradition von Archimedes’ Schrift darüber) und löste ein in einer Anekdote über Archimedes überliefertes antikes Problem (Krone des Hieron II.) durch Konstruktion einer hydrostatischen Waage zur Bestimmung des spezifischen Gewichts (\\"La bilancetta,\\" Manuskript). Seine 1587 erfolgte Bewerbung um eine Professorenstelle für Mathematik an der Päpstlichen Universität von Bologna hatte keinen Erfolg, obwohl er sich in der Bewerbung drei Jahre älter machte. Man zog den älteren Giovanni Antonio Magini vor, der außerdem dort studiert hatte. Die Gutachter vermuteten auch einen Fehler in den von Galilei der Bewerbung beigegebenen mathematischen Schriften. Danach schuf er sich aber einen Ruf als Mathematiker in Florenz unter anderem durch öffentliche Vorlesungen in der Akademie über die Architektur-Maße der Hölle (1588) und durch ein Manuskript über die Theorie der Schwerpunkte in der Tradition von Archimedes (1587), das er zirkulieren ließ., Hochschullehrer in Pisa, 1589–1592., Im Jahr 1589 erhielt Galilei für drei Jahre eine Stelle als Hochschullehrer und Inhaber des Lehrstuhls für Mathematik an der Universität Pisa. Er unterrichtete Euklids Elemente und elementare Astronomie sowie Astrologie für Mediziner. Die Bezahlung war allerdings gering; dennoch gelang es ihm, vorzügliche Instrumente zu bauen und zu verkaufen. Auch entwickelte er ein –noch sehr ungenau arbeitendes– Thermometer. Er untersuchte die Pendelbewegung und fand, dass die Periode nicht von der Auslenkung oder dem Gewicht des Pendels, sondern von dessen Länge abhängt. Bis in seine letzten Lebensjahre beschäftigte ihn das Problem, wie man diese Entdeckung zur Konstruktion einer Pendeluhr nutzen kann., Ausgehend von der Bewegung des Pendels führte Galilei als Versuchsanordnung zur Untersuchung der Fallgesetze die schiefe Ebene mit anschließender horizontaler Bahn ein. Die schiefe Ebene diente ihm zur „Verdünnung“ der Schwerkraft, weil die Messung der Fallgeschwindigkeit damals noch zu ungenau war. Galilei benützte in diesen Experimenten Kugeln aus verschiedenen Materialien. Das erlaubte es erstmals, den langsam anrollenden Kugeln eine bestimmte Geschwindigkeit zu erteilen und diese zu messen. So entdeckte er die Beschleunigung und die Tatsache, dass diese etwas von der Geschwindigkeit völlig verschiedenes ist. Dies wiederum ließ sich am besten in der Formelsprache der Mathematik darstellen. Am deutlichsten formulierte Galilei diese neue Einstellung zur Physik 1623 im \\"Saggiatore:\\", Galileis Schüler und erster Biograf Vincenzo Viviani behauptete, Galilei habe in Pisa auch Fallversuche vom Schiefen Turm unternommen. In Galileis eigenen Schriften und Aufzeichnungen findet sich jedoch kein Hinweis auf solche Versuche. Davon zu unterscheiden ist das Turmargument als Gedankenexperiment, auf das Galilei in seinem Hauptwerk \\"Dialogo\\" eingeht., Galilei fasste die Ergebnisse seiner mechanischen Untersuchungen in einem Manuskript zusammen, das heute als \\"De motu antiquiora\\" zitiert wird und erst 1890 gedruckt wurde. Darin enthaltene Angriffe auf Aristoteles nahmen seine aristotelisch geprägten Kollegen in Pisa unfreundlich auf. Galileis Anstellung wurde 1592 nicht verlängert. Seine materielle Situation war zusätzlich dadurch verschärft, dass 1591 sein Vater gestorben war und er nun als ältester Sohn auch für seine Geschwister (einen Bruder und drei Schwestern) und Mutter Verantwortung übernehmen musste., Professor in Padua, 1592–1610., Dank guter Protektion aus florentinischen Kreisen wurde Galilei 1592 auf den Lehrstuhl für Mathematik an der Universität Padua berufen, auf den sich auch Giordano Bruno Hoffnungen gemacht hatte. In Padua, das zur reichen und liberalen Republik Venedig gehörte, blieb Galilei 18 Jahre lang., Obwohl seine Stelle wesentlich besser dotiert war als die vorige in Pisa, besserte Galilei sein Gehalt auf, indem er neben seinen akademischen Vorlesungen vornehmen Schülern Privatunterricht erteilte, darunter zwei späteren Kardinälen. Ferner vertrieb Galilei ab 1597 einen \\"Proportionszirkel\\". Für die Fertigung dieses Vorläufers des Rechenschiebers, der \\"Compasso\\" genannt wurde und dessen Konstruktion er erheblich verbessert hatte, beschäftigte er einen eigenen Mechaniker. Bereits in diesem Jahr ließ er in einem Brief an Johannes Kepler deutlich erkennen, dass er das heliozentrische Weltsystem gegenüber dem vorherrschenden Glauben an das geozentrische Weltbild favorisierte: „… unser Lehrer Copernicus, der verlacht wurde“., Die heute nach Kepler benannte Supernova von 1604 veranlasste ihn zu drei öffentlichen Vorträgen, in denen er die aristotelische Astronomie und Naturphilosophie angriff. Aus der Tatsache, dass keine Parallaxe festgestellt werden konnte, schloss Galilei wie bereits 1572 Tycho Brahe, dass der neue Stern weit von der Erde entfernt sei und sich deshalb in der Fixsternsphäre befinden müsse. Nach herrschender Lehre wurde diese Sphäre für unveränderlich gehalten und Galilei vertrat damit ein weiteres Argument gegen die Anschauungen der Peripatetiker, wie man die Aristoteles-Schüler auch nannte. Seine Untersuchungen zu den Bewegungsgesetzen setzte er in diesen Jahren fort., 1609 erfuhr Galilei von dem im Jahr zuvor in Holland von Jan Lipperhey erfundenen Fernrohr. Er baute aus käuflichen Linsen ein Gerät mit ungefähr vierfacher Vergrößerung, lernte dann selbst Linsen zu schleifen und erreichte bald eine acht- bis neunfache, in späteren Jahren bis zu 33-fache Vergrößerung. Aus dieser Zeit stammt auch ein in der Nationalbibliothek von Florenz entdeckter Einkaufszettel, der Einblick gibt, wie Galilei seine diesbezüglichen Erkenntnisse in die Praxis umsetzte., Am 25.August 1609 führte Galilei sein Instrument, dessen militärischer Nutzen auf der Hand lag und das im Gegensatz zum wenig später entwickelten Kepler-Fernrohr eine aufrecht stehende Abbildung lieferte, der venezianischen Regierung –der Signoria– vor. Das Instrument machte einen tiefen Eindruck und Galilei überließ der Signoria das völlig illusorische alleinige Recht zur Herstellung solcher Instrumente, woraufhin sein Gehalt erhöht wurde. Verschiedentlich wurde behauptet, Galilei habe die Erfindung des Fernrohrs wider besseres Wissen für sich beansprucht, so durch Brecht im Drama \\"Leben des Galilei\\" und durch Hans Conrad Zander, der sich auf das Galilei-Zitat zu einem „neulich von ihm erfundenen Fernrohr“ aus dem Sidereus Nuncius beruft. Dagegen hat Galilei die Grundidee des Teleskops wohl nicht als seine eigene Erfindung ausgegeben, eine Gehaltskürzung (-suspension) im folgenden Jahr deutet aber an, dass sich die Signoria durchaus hinters Licht geführt fühlte., Als einer der ersten Forscher nutzte Galilei ein Fernrohr zur Himmelsbeobachtung. Dies bedeutete eine Revolution in der Astronomie, denn bis dahin waren die Menschen auf Beobachtungen mit dem bloßen Auge angewiesen. Er stellte fest, dass die Oberfläche des Mondes rau und uneben ist, mit Erhebungen, Klüften und Kratern. Er erkannte zudem, dass die dunkle Partie der Mondoberfläche von der Erde aufgehellt wird (sog. Erdschein) und dass die Planeten –im Gegensatz zu den Fixsternen– als Scheiben zu sehen sind. Er entdeckte die vier größten Monde des Jupiter, die er in Vorbereitung seines Wechsels an den Medici-Hof die \\"Mediceischen Gestirne\\" nannte und die heute als die \\"Galileischen Monde\\" bezeichnet werden. Unabhängig von ihm gelang dies fast gleichzeitig Simon Marius. Der chinesische Astronom Gan De schreibt bereits im Jahr 365 v. Chr., einen Begleiter des Jupiter gesehen zu haben. Vermutlich war dies Ganymed, der unter idealen Bedingungen für das bloße Auge sichtbar ist. Galilei beobachtete, dass es sich bei der Milchstraße nicht um ein nebliges Gebilde (wie es dem bloßen Auge vorkommt), sondern um \\"„nihil aliud quam innumerarum Stellarum coacervatim consitarum congeries\\" (nichts anderes als eine Anhäufung zahlloser Sterne)“ handelt. Diese Entdeckungen und seine Federzeichnung der Mondoberfläche wurden im \\"Sidereus Nuncius\\" (Sternenbote bzw. Nachricht von den Sternen) von 1610 veröffentlicht und machten Galilei auf einen Schlag berühmt.

If left untreated, the infection can spread to the surrounding tissues and potentially cause an abscess or localized infection. However, it is rare for a root canal infection to spread and cause a systemic infection in the body. In some cases, if the infection is severe and left untreated for a long time, it can potentially spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. This is known as bacteremia. However, this is also rare and usually only occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems or certain pre-existing medical conditions. Overall, while a root canal infection can cause localized infections or complications, it does not commonly cause widespread infections in the body. However, it is important to seek prompt dental treatment if you suspect a root canal infection to prevent any potential complications."},{"instruction":"Does root canal infection cause bacteria","output":"Yes, a root canal infection is caused by bacteria. The infection occurs when bacteria enter the pulp of the tooth, usually due to tooth decay, a cracked tooth, or other types of dental trauma. The bacteria then multiply and cause an infection in the pulp, leading to inflammation, pain, and other symptoms. It is important to treat a root canal infection to remove the bacteria and prevent further complications."},{"instruction":"How much the bacteria need to creat a root canal infection","output":"The development of a root canal infection requires the presence of bacteria in the pulp of the tooth. However, the exact quantity of bacteria needed to cause an infection can vary from person to person and depends on various factors. Generally, the bacteria need a sufficient number to overwhelm the body's natural defense mechanisms and establish an infection. This can occur when there is a significant amount of dental decay or a deep cavity that allows bacteria to reach the pulp and multiply. Additionally, factors such as compromised immune systems, poor oral hygiene, and inadequate dental treatment can increase the risk of bacteria causing a root canal infection. It's worth noting that the ability to develop an infection is not solely dependent on the quantity of bacteria, but also the type and aggressiveness of the bacteria involved, as well as the individual's immune response. Prompt treatment of dental decay and oral infections is important to prevent the bacteria from developing into a root canal infection."},{"instruction":"How long does the bacteria need to cause root canal?","output":"The time it takes for bacteria to cause a root canal infection can vary depending on several factors, such as the individual's oral hygiene, immune response, and the specific type of bacteria involved. In general, the process of a root canal infection can take several months to develop. Initially, the bacteria need to penetrate the hard outer layers of the tooth, such as the enamel and dentin, to reach the softer pulp tissue inside. This can occur when there is dental decay, a cracked or fractured tooth, or other forms of dental trauma that expose the pulp to bacteria. Once the bacteria reach the pulp, they can multiply and gradually cause inflammation and infection. The speed at which this occurs can vary based on the aggressiveness of the bacteria and the individual's immune response. Some individuals may experience a faster progression of the infection, while others may have a slower or more gradual development. It's important to note that if you suspect a root canal infection, prompt dental treatment is necessary to remove the bacteria and prevent further complications. The timeline of the infection can vary, but seeking care as soon as possible can help prevent further damage to the tooth and surrounding tissues."},{"instruction":"I need a specific number","output":"I apologize for the confusion, but it is not possible to provide a specific number for how long it takes for bacteria to cause a root canal infection. The timeline can vary significantly from person to person and depends on various factors, as mentioned earlier. Each individual's oral health, immune response, and the specific conditions present in their mouth can affect the speed at which a root canal infection develops. It is best to consult with a dental professional, who can evaluate your specific situation and provide more personalized information."},{"instruction":"So what is the average number or common number","output":"While it's challenging to provide a specific average or common number for the time it takes for bacteria to cause a root canal infection, it is generally believed that it can take several months for the infection to develop. The process typically begins with the bacteria penetrating the tooth's harder outer layers, such as the enamel and dentin, to reach the pulp. From there, the bacteria gradually multiply and cause inflammation and infection in the pulp. The speed at which this occurs can vary based on individual factors such as oral hygiene, immune response, and the aggressiveness of the bacteria involved. However, it's important to note that each case can be unique and there is no precise timetable for the development of a root canal infection. Early detection and prompt dental treatment are crucial to preventing further complications and preserving the tooth. I encourage you to consult with a dental professional for a more accurate evaluation and information specific to your situation."},{"instruction":"Are there bacteria in root canal","output":"Yes, a root canal infection is caused by bacteria that infect the pulp of the tooth. When bacteria enter the tooth through dental decay, a crack, or trauma, they can multiply and cause an infection in the pulp. This infection can lead to inflammation, pain, and other symptoms associated with a root canal infection. During a root canal treatment, the dentist or endodontist removes the infected pulp along with the bacteria from the root canal system. The canal is then cleaned, disinfected, and sealed to prevent further bacterial growth and reinfection. Therefore, although bacteria may initially be present in a root canal infection, the goal of treatment is to eliminate them from the root canal space."},{"instruction":"Does this bacteria entire into our body","output":"During a root canal infection, bacteria are localized within the tooth and surrounding tissues. However, if the infection is left untreated or becomes severe, it is possible for bacteria to enter the bloodstream and potentially spread to other parts of the body. This is known as bacteremia. Bacteremia occurs when bacteria from an infection enter the bloodstream. It can happen during dental procedures, including root canal treatment, as well as during activities that can cause injury or trauma to the mouth, such as brushing vigorously or chewing hard foods. In most healthy individuals, the immune system is able to control and eliminate the bacteria from the bloodstream, preventing widespread infection. However, individuals with weakened immune systems or certain pre-existing medical conditions may be at a higher risk of complications from bacteremia. It's worth noting that the risk of systemic infection from a root canal infection is generally low, but it is still important to seek prompt treatment to prevent any potential complications. Maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups can help reduce the risk of developing a root canal infection or any associated complications."},{"instruction":"ما هو موقع الفيسبوك","output":"موقع الفيسبوك هو منصة تواصل اجتماعي عبر الإنترنت تأسست في عام 2004. يتيح الموقع للمستخدمين إنشاء حسابات شخصية وتحديث حالتهم ومشاركة المحتوى مثل الصور والفيديوهات والروابط مع الأصدقاء والعائلة والزملاء والشركات والمجتمعات الأخرى. كما يمكن للمستخدمين البحث عن أصدقاء جدد والانضمام إلى مجموعات وصفحات على الفيسبوك للتفاعل مع مواضيع واهتمامات مشتركة."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Chemisches Element, Erdmetall, Gallium, Gesundheitsschädlicher Stoff bei Verschlucken, Gruppe-13-Element, Periode-4-Element, Umweltgefährlicher Stoff (chronisch wassergefährdend)], Gallium ist ein selten vorkommendes chemisches Element mit dem Elementsymbol Ga und der Ordnungszahl 31. Im Periodensystem steht es in der 4. Periode und ist das dritte Element der 3. Hauptgruppe, 13.IUPAC-Gruppe, oder Borgruppe. Es ist ein silberweißes, leicht zu verflüssigendes Metall. Gallium kristallisiert nicht in einer der sonst häufig bei Metallen anzutreffenden Kristallstrukturen, sondern in seiner stabilsten Modifikation in einer orthorhombischen Struktur mit Gallium-Dimeren. Daneben sind noch sechs weitere Modifikationen bekannt, die sich bei speziellen Kristallisationsbedingungen oder unter hohem Druck bilden. In seinen chemischen Eigenschaften ähnelt das Metall stark dem Aluminium., In der Natur kommt Gallium nur in geringem Umfang und meist als Beimischung in Aluminium-, Zink- oder Germaniumerzen vor; Galliumminerale sind sehr selten. Gallium wird auch als Nebenprodukt bei der Produktion von Aluminium oder Zink gewonnen. Der größte Teil des Galliums wird zum III-V-Verbindungshalbleiter Galliumarsenid weiterverarbeitet, der vor allem in der Hochfrequenztechnik, beispielsweise für HF-Transistoren, und in der Optoelektronik, beispielsweise für Leuchtdioden, verwendet wird., Geschichte., Erstmals wurde ein dem später Gallium genanntem entsprechendes Element 1871 von Dmitri Mendelejew vorausgesagt. Er prognostizierte mit Hilfe des von ihm entwickelten Periodensystems ein neues, \\"Eka-Aluminium\\" genanntes Element und sagte auch einige Eigenschaften dieses Elementes (Atommasse, spezifisches Gewicht, Schmelzpunktlage und Art der Salze) voraus., Der französische Chemiker Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, der Mendelejews Voraussagen nicht kannte, hatte herausgefunden, dass in der Linienabfolge im Linienspektrum von Elementfamilien bestimmte Gesetze herrschen, und versuchte, diese für die Aluminiumfamilie zu bestätigen. Dabei erkannte er, dass zwischen Aluminium und Indium ein weiteres, noch unbekanntes Element stehen müsse. 1875 gelang es ihm schließlich, im Emissionsspektrum von Zinkblende-Erz, das er in Säure gelöst und mit metallischem Zink versetzt hatte, zwei violette Spektrallinien nachzuweisen, die er dem unbekannten Element zuordnete., Anschließend konnte Lecoq de Boisbaudran aus einigen hundert Kilogramm Zinkblende eine größere Menge Galliumhydroxid gewinnen. Daraus stellte er durch Lösen in einer Kaliumcarbonatlösung und Elektrolyse erstmals elementares Gallium dar., Lecoq de Boisbaudran benannte das Element nach Gallien, der lateinischen Bezeichnung seines Heimatlandes Frankreich., Nachdem die Eigenschaften des neuen Elementes bestimmt waren, erkannte Mendelejew schnell, dass es sich dabei um das von ihm vorausberechnete Eka-Aluminium handeln müsse. Viele Eigenschaften stimmten sehr genau mit den vorausberechneten Werten überein. So wich der theoretisch ermittelte Wert der Dichte von 5,9 nur sehr wenig vom experimentellen von 5,904 ab., Vorkommen., Gallium ist auf der Erde ein seltenes Element. Mit einem Gehalt von 19ppm in der kontinentalen Erdkruste ist seine Häufigkeit vergleichbar mit derjenigen von Lithium und Blei. Es kommt nicht elementar, sondern nur gebunden vor, vorwiegend in Aluminium-, Zink- oder Germaniumerzen. Zu den galliumreichsten Erzen zählen Bauxite, Zinkblende-Erze und Germanit., Die Galliumgehalte sind meist gering; so enthält der in Surinam gefundene Bauxit mit dem höchsten bekannten Gehalt nur 0,008 % Gallium. Die weltweit in Bauxit befindlichen Galliumreserven werden auf 1,6·106Tonnen geschätzt. Höhere Gehalte mit bis zu 1 % Gallium kommen in Germanit vor. Lediglich in der Apex-Mine im US-Bundesstaat Utah kommen so hohe Gehalte in den Erzen vor, dass ein Abbau zur Galliumgewinnung versucht wurde. Dies scheiterte jedoch nach kurzer Zeit aus Rentabilitätsgründen., Nur wenige Galliumminerale sind bekannt; zu diesen zählen die vorwiegend in Tsumeb in Namibia gefundenen Gallit (CuGaS2), Söhngeit (Ga(OH)3) und Tsumgallit (GaO(OH))., Gewinnung und Darstellung., Gallium wird als Nebenprodukt bei der Aluminiumherstellung aus Bauxit im Bayer-Verfahren gewonnen. Als Ausgangsprodukt dient das dabei in Natronlauge gelöste Gemisch von Natriumaluminat und Natriumgallat. Durch verschiedene Verfahren kann hieraus Gallium vom Aluminium getrennt werden. Eine Möglichkeit ist die fraktionierte Kristallisation mit Hilfe von Kohlenstoffdioxid, wobei zunächst bevorzugt Aluminiumhydroxid ausfällt, während sich das leichter lösliche Natriumgallat in der Natronlauge anreichert. Erst nach weiteren Prozessschritten wird Galliumhydroxid gefällt, vermischt mit Aluminiumhydroxid. Anschließend wird das Gemisch in Natronlauge gelöst und Gallium durch Elektrolyse gewonnen. Da dieses Verfahren energie- und arbeitsaufwendig ist, wird es nur in Ländern mit geringen Kosten dafür, etwa der Volksrepublik China, angewendet., Gallium kann auch direkt durch Elektrolyse aus der Natronlauge gewonnen werden. Dazu werden Quecksilberkathoden eingesetzt, wobei sich bei der Elektrolyse ein Galliumamalgam bildet. Auch das Versetzen der Lösung mit Natriumamalgam ist möglich., Mit Hilfe spezieller Hydroxychinoline als Chelatliganden ist es möglich, Gallium aus der Natronlauge mit Kerosin zu extrahieren und so vom Aluminium zu trennen. Weitere Elemente, die dabei ebenfalls extrahiert werden, können mit verdünnten Säuren abgetrennt werden. Anschließend wird die verbliebene Galliumverbindung in konzentrierter Salz- oder Schwefelsäure gelöst und elektrolytisch zum Metall reduziert. Im Labormaßstab lässt sich Gallium durch Elektrolyse einer Lösung von Galliumhydroxid in Natronlauge an Platin- oder Wolfram-Elektroden darstellen., Für viele technische Anwendungen wird sehr reines Gallium benötigt; für Halbleiter beispielsweise darf es mitunter nur ein Hundertmillionstel an Fremdstoffen enthalten. Mögliche Reinigungsverfahren sind Vakuumdestillation, fraktionierte Kristallisation oder Zonenschmelzen., Die Menge an produziertem Gallium ist gering, aber aufgrund der zunehmenden Verwendung in der Halbleiterindustrie stark steigend. 2008 betrug die Weltprimärproduktion 95Tonnen, im Jahr 2021 schon geschätzt 430 Tonnen, davon 225t hochreines Gallium. Hauptproduktionsland von primärem Gallium mit fast 97 % Weltmarktanteil im Jahr 2020 war China. Da es nach 2012 zu einem Überschuss an Gallium und damit Preisverfall kam, stellten damals viele Länder die Primärproduktion von Gallium ein. Kasachstan z.B. 2013, Ungarn 2015, Deutschland 2016, Großbritannien 2018 und die Ukraine 2019. Wegen steigender Preise 2020 und 2021 kündigte Deutschland eine Wiederaufnahme der Primärproduktion von Gallium für Ende 2021 an. Eine weitere wichtige Quelle ist das Wiederaufbereiten von galliumhaltigen Abfällen, daraus wurden 2008 weitere 135Tonnen Gallium gewonnen. Galliumrecycling findet in den Vereinigten Staaten, Japan, der Slowakei, Deutschland, der Volksrepublik China und Kanada statt. Die weltweiten Reserven an Gallium sind unbekannt. Durchschnittlich enthalten Bauxit und manche Zinkerze ca. 50 ppm Gallium. Somit ergibt sich rechnerisch aus den weltweit bekannten Bauxitreserven eine Menge von ca. 1 Mio. Tonnen Gallium, wovon aber nur 10 % als gewinnbar gelten., Die Produktion von Gallium ist sehr energieintensiv. Laut Angaben der Rohstoffallianz ERMA ist das ein Grund, warum etwa 80 Prozent aus der VR China kommen., Die Volksrepublik China hat im Juli bekanntgegeben, dass ab dem 1. August 2023 Genehmigungen für den Export von Gallium und Germanium nötig sein werden. Die staatlichen Förderkonzerne der DR Kongo und Russlands haben angekündigt, ihre Fördermengen auszuweiten. Kasachstan hat in der Vergangenheit schon bis zu 40 Prozent des Galliumbedarfs auf der Welt abgedeckt., Eigenschaften., Physikalische Eigenschaften., Gallium ist ein silberweißes, weiches (Mohs-Härte: 1,5) Metall. Es hat einen für Metalle ungewöhnlich niedrigen Schmelzpunkt, der bei 29,76°C liegt. Es ist damit nach Quecksilber und Caesium das Metall mit dem niedrigsten Schmelzpunkt, der auch deutlich unter denjenigen der benachbarten Elemente Aluminium und Indium liegt. Verantwortlich hierfür ist wahrscheinlich die ungewöhnliche Kristallstruktur, die im Gegensatz zu den Strukturen anderer Metalle keine hohe Symmetrie aufweist und daher nicht sehr stabil ist. Da der Siedepunkt mit 2400°C vergleichsweise hoch liegt, besitzt Gallium einen ungewöhnlich großen Bereich, in dem es flüssig ist. Auf Grund der schwierigen Kristallisation lässt sich flüssiges Gallium leicht unter den Schmelzpunkt abkühlen (Unterkühlung) und kristallisiert bei der Bildung von Kristallisationskeimen schlagartig. Typische Werte der Unterkühlung liegen bei Temperaturunterschieden von 40 bis 70 °C. Schmelzpunkt und Gefrierpunkt werden durch Verminderung der Größe verringert, so weist ein 35 nm großer Partikel Gallium eine Schmelztemperatur von ca. −14,7°C und eine Gefriertemperatur von ca. −128,3 °C auf. Die physikalischen Eigenschaften verändern sich durch den fest-flüssigen Phasenübergang. So sinkt die elektrische Leitfähigkeit am Phasenübergang von ca. 0,71 · 105 S/cm (Feststoff) auf 0,38· 105 S/cm (Flüssigkeit). Weiterhin besitzt Gallium – wie Silicium, einige andere Elemente und Wasser – eine Dichteanomalie; seine Dichte ist im flüssigen Zustand um etwa 3,2 % höher als in fester Form und liegt bei ca. 6,09 g/cm³. Dies ist typisch für Stoffe, die im festen Zustand molekulare Bindungen besitzen. Weitere wichtige Parameter für Flüssigkeiten sind die Oberflächenspannung und die Viskosität. Die Oberflächenspannung wurde von vielen Wissenschaftlern gemessen und man hat sich auf einen Wert von ca. 711 mN/m geeinigt (zum Vergleich liegt die Oberflächenspannung von Wasser bei ca. 72,7 mN/m). Die Oberflächenspannung sinkt durch Oxidation (Gallium oxidiert an der Luft spontan und schnell) auf etwa die Hälfte des ursprünglichen Wertes (ca. 360 mN/m), ist jedoch schwer zu messen, da sich die Oxidschicht wie ein Feststoff verhält und somit eine Fließgrenze entsteht. Die Viskosität von flüssigem Gallium liegt bei ca. 2,0mPa·s., Gallium ist im festen Zustand diamagnetisch, wird jedoch im flüssigen Zustand paramagnetisch (\\"χm\\" = 2,4 · 10−6 bei 40°C)., Charakteristisch für seine Strukturen ist das Ausbilden von Gallium-Gallium-Bindungen. Es sind verschiedene Modifikationen bekannt, die sich bei unterschiedlichen Kristallisationsbedingungen (vier bekannte Modifikationen, α- bis δ-Gallium, unter Normald: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Chemisches Element, Erdmetall, Gallium, Gesundheitsschädlicher Stoff, Gruppe-13-Element, Periode-4-Element, Umweltgefährlicher Stoff, seltenes Element, Halbleiter, Primärproduktion"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geboren 1831, Gestorben 1881, James A.

November 1831 in Orange Township (heutiges Moreland Hills), Cuyahoga County, Ohio; †19. September 1881 in Elberon, Monmouth County, New Jersey) war ein amerikanischer Politiker (Republikanische Partei) und vom 4.März 1881 bis zu seinem Tod infolge eines Attentats der 20.Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten., Garfield wuchs in ärmlichen Verhältnissen im damaligen Grenzland \\"(Frontier)\\" als Halbwaise auf. Als überzeugter Anhänger des christlichen Restoration Movements („Erneuerungsbewegung“) besuchte er dessen \\"Western Reserve Eclectic Institute\\" (heutiges Hiram College) und wechselte später auf das Williams College, wo er seinen Abschluss machte. Danach war er Lehrer am Hiram College, bis er 1859 in die Politik ging und in den Senat von Ohio gewählt wurde. Parallel dazu studierte er Jura. Während des Sezessionskriegs kämpfte er für die Nordstaaten und brachte es in der Unionsarmee zum Generalmajor, wobei er sich vor allem in der Schlacht von Middle Creek auszeichnen konnte., Ab 1863 war er Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten und zählte anfangs zur Fraktion der radikalen Republikaner. Später näherte er sich den \\"Half-Breeds\\" („Mischlingen, Halbblütern“) an, die eine Verwaltungsreform zur Abschaffung des Spoilssystems („Beutesystem“) anstrebten. Ein zentrales Projekt für Garfield im Kongress war die Durchsetzung einer auf dem Goldstandard beruhenden antiinflationäre Hartgeldpolitik. Die meisten Akzente konnte er als Vorsitzender des \\"Committee on Appropriations\\" („Haushaltsausschuss“) setzen. Im Jahr 1873 schädigten die mutmaßliche Verwicklung in den Korruptionsskandal um die Baufirma Crédit Mobilier of America und die Mitwirkung an einer Gehaltserhöhung für Kongressabgeordnete für einige Zeit sein Ansehen erheblich. Dennoch wurde er 1877 Fraktionsführer der Republikaner im Repräsentantenhaus. Im gleichen Jahr saß Garfield im Kongressausschuss, der über den umstrittenen Ausgang der Präsidentschaftswahl von 1876 entschied und war an der daran anschließenden Aushandlung des Kompromisses von 1877 beteiligt., Auf dem zwischen den Faktionen der \\"Stalwarts\\" („Feste, Starke, Mutige“) und \\"Half-Breeds\\" stark umkämpften Nominierungsparteitag der Republikaner im Juni 1880 konnte er sich als Überraschungssieger und Kompromisskandidat gegen Ulysses S. Grant und James G. Blaine durchsetzen. Nach seinem Sieg bei der Präsidentschaftswahl gegen den demokratischen Bewerber Winfield Scott Hancock war er nur für wenige Monate im Amt, die durch Querelen mit Roscoe Conkling um Stellenbesetzungen gekennzeichnet waren., Am 2. Juli 1881 wurde er bei einem Attentat von Charles J. Guiteau schwer verwundet und erlag seinen Verletzungen keine drei Monate später. Sein Mörder hatte sich zuvor erfolglos um eine Position in der Garfield-Administration beworben., Leben., Familie und Ausbildung (1831–1850)., James A. Garfield wurde nach seinem älteren Bruder James Ballou Garfield, der als Kind starb, und nach seinem Vater Abram Garfield benannt. Dessen Vorfahr Edward Garfield war 1630 aus Europa in die Massachusetts Bay Colony ausgewandert, wo seine Nachkommen für lange Zeit lebten. Abram Garfields Großvater übersiedelte nach der Amerikanischen Revolution nach Worchester in New York, wo auch sein Enkel zur Welt kam. James A. Garfields Mutter, Eliza Ballou, hatte aus Providence stammende Eltern und wurde in New Hampshire geboren. Nachdem ihr Vater gestorben war, lebte sie mit ihrer Mutter in Worchester, wo sie Abram Garfield kennenlernte. Im Februar 1820 heirateten sie und zogen in das malariaverseuchte Tal des Cuyahoga Rivers in der Western Reserve, damals vom restlichen Ohio isoliertes und durch ärmliche Lebensbedingungen gekennzeichnetes Grenzland \\"(Frontier)\\". Im Jahr 1829 erwarb Abram Garfield nach einem kurzfristigen geschäftlichen Erfolg als Kleinunternehmer im Kanalbau acht Hektar eigenes Farmland samt Blockhaus im Orange Township, dem heutigen Moreland Hills. Hier kam zwei Jahre später James A. Garfield als jüngstes von fünf Kindern zur Welt., Im Jahr 1833 traten Garfields Eltern dem Restoration Movement („Erneuerungsbewegung“) bei, einer christlichen Erweckungsbewegung unter Führung von Alexander Campbell. Diese Kirche, die in der Western Reserve als \\"Disciples of Christ\\" („Jünger Christi“) bekannt war und pietistische Züge aufwies, prägte den weiteren Lebensweg Garfields. Im Mai 1833 starb sein Vater an einer Lungenkrankheit, was die Familie an den Rand der Armut brachte. So musste die Mutter Teile ihres Grundbesitzes verkaufen, um die drängendsten Schulden abzuzahlen, und Garfields 12-jähriger Bruder Thomas die Farmarbeiten des Vaters übernehmen. Eliza Garfield heiratete im April 1842 erneut, aber verließ ihren in einem Nachbarort lebenden Mann nach einem Jahr, was in der damaligen Zeit als selten vorkommendes, skandalöses Verhalten galt. Als Jugendlicher wurde Garfield zu einem leidenschaftlichen Leser, den vor allem Seefahrtsgeschichten faszinierten. Im August 1848 verließ er kurzentschlossen die Mutter, um im nahegelegenen Cleveland auf einem Schiff anzuheuern. Letztendlich fand er eine Anstellung auf einem Kanalboot, das zwischen Cleveland und Pittsburgh verkehrte. Anfang Oktober musste er die Arbeit aufgeben und nach Hause zurückkehren, als bei ihm eine starke Fieberkrankheit ausbrach. Dort konnten ihn die Mutter und sein Grundschullehrer dazu überreden, fürs Erste weiter auf die Schule zu gehen., Ab März 1849 besuchte er eine weiterführende Akademie in Chester Township im Geauga County, die von Baptisten betrieben wurde. Zu dieser Zeit gab es kein bundesstaatliches Schulsystem in Ohio, weshalb Jugendliche auf Sekundarschulen dieser Art angewiesen waren, wenn sie nach der Grundschule weiterlernen wollten. In diesem Umfeld entwickelte Garfield einen außergewöhnlichen Bildungseifer und legte seine Seefahrtspläne rasch ad acta. Um Schule und Unterkunft in einer Pension zu finanzieren, arbeitete er in einer Zimmerei und wie viele seiner Mitschüler ab November 1849 nach einer oberflächlichen Prüfung als Lehrer. Auf einer regionalen Versammlung der \\"Disciples of Christ\\" im März 1850 hatte er ein religiöses Erweckungserlebnis und ließ sich taufen. Hatte er bis dahin vor allem der Mutter zuliebe die Gottesdienste besucht, war er von nun an ein überzeugter „Jünger Christi“. Sein Glaube spiegelte sich in seinen politischen Überzeugungen wider. So lehnte er den Abolitionismus, also die Sklavenbefreiung, ab, weil sich die Bibel an keiner Stelle gegen diese Institution ausspräche, und nahm nicht an den ausschweifenden Feiern zum Unabhängigkeitstag teil, sondern verbrachte die Zeit im Gebet. Aufgrund seiner religiösen Überzeugung und aus finanziellen Gründen fühlte er sich an der baptistischen Akademie zunehmend unwohl., Western Reserve Eclectic Institute und Williams College (1850–1856)., Gegen Ende 1850 verließ er die Schule in Geauga und arbeitete für ein Jahr als Lehrer und Zimmerer. Im Herbst 1851 schrieb er sich am Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (heutiges Hiram College) in Hiram im Portage County ein, eine von den \\"Disciples of Christ\\" betriebene Bildungseinrichtung. Aufgrund seiner Vorbildung und starken Physis genoss er unter den Mitschülern hohes Ansehen. Garfield gewann in dieser Zeit weiter an Selbstvertrauen und entdeckte an sich eine außergewöhnliche Begabung als Redner. Tatsächlich wurde er später einer der effektivsten Wahlredner seiner Generation. Das Curriculum umfasste neben der von ihm besonders geschätzten klassischen Bildung in Latein und Griechisch auch Geologie, Mathematik und Spencer-Schrift. Außerschulisch las er mit einer befreundeten Mitschülerin Horaz, Vergil, Sallust, Xenophon und das Neue Testament. Daher rührend verwendete er bei seinen späteren Reden im Kongress der Vereinigten Staaten oft lateinische Zitate als Stilmittel. Ab Frühjahr 1853 begann er sich als Prediger in den Kirchen der Umgebung zu betätigen. Gegen Jahresende entwickelte er eine zunehmende Leidenschaft für die Mitschülerin Lucretia Rudolph, die er seit der Akademie in Chester kannte. Ihr Vater Zeb Rudolph war ein führender \\"Disciple\\" und saß im Vorstand des Western Reserve Eclectic Institute. Einer Vertiefung ihrer Beziehung stand vorerst entgegen, dass sich Garfield am Eclectic Institute, an dem er seit einem Jahr selbst Unterricht gab, intellektuell unterfordert fühlte, und Anfang 1854 beschloss, auf eine Universität zu wechseln. Hinzu kam, dass das Eclectic Institute keinen staatlich anerkannten Bachelor-Abschluss anbot., Im Juli 1854 wurde er nach einer kurzen Prüfung durch den Universitätspräsidenten Mark Hopkins als Student am Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts zugelassen. Hopkins Einfluss schärfte in den folgenden Jahren die kritische Denkfähigkeit Garfields, der in dem geistigen Klima dieses neuenglischen und calvinistischen Colleges aufblühte und es später als den eigentlichen Start seines intellektuellen Lebens beschrieb. Anfangs wurde er von den zumeist jüngeren und aus wohlhabenden Verhältnissen stammenden Kommilitonen kritisch beäugt. Aufgrund seiner glänzenden Leistungen im Debattierclub, der in der Ära vor dem Aufkommen des Collegesports den Mittelpunkt studentischer Aktivitäten auf dem Campus bildete, verschaffte er sich rasch hohes Ansehen. In der Folge wurde er zum Vorsitzenden einiger Studentenclubs und zum Herausgeber des Universitätsmagazins \\"Williams Quarterly\\" gewählt. Weil einige der Kommilitonen streng religiöse Calvinisten waren, hielt er sich mit dem eigenen Glauben bedeckt. Den zu dieser Zeit an Bedeutung gewinnenden Studentenverbindungen \\"(Fraternities und Sororities)\\" stand er ablehnend gegenüber. Zur Finanzierung seines Studiums arbeitete er während der Semesterferien in den umliegenden Ortschaften als Lehrer. In Pownal, Vermont, unterrichtete er an der gleichen Schule wie ein Jahr zuvor sein späterer Vizepräsident Chester A. Arthur., Garfield war ein guter, aber kein brillanter Student, der mit seinen Leistungen deutlich in der oberen Hälfte des Jahrgangs lag. Am Williams College kam er vertieft mit Naturwissenschaften in Berührung, wobei er sich aber mit Chemie nie anfreunden konnte. Insbesondere begeisterte sich Garfield so sehr für Germanistik, dass er eine Zeit lang ein Studium in Göttingen in Erwägung zog. Hopkins und das akademische Umfeld insgesamt bewirkten, dass Garfield sich für Politik zu interessieren begann. Im Frühjahr des Präsidentschaftswahljahrs 1856 besuchte er eine Wahlkampfveranstaltung für John C. Frémont und hielt hier seine erste politische Rede. Einige von Garfields religiösen Überzeugungen kamen in dieser Phase ins Wanken. So bewog ihn das Studium von Theodor Körners Gedichten dazu, seinen den Lehren der \\"Disciples of Christ\\" geschuldeten Pazifismus zu überdenken.

Jahrhundert, Gotische Kirche, Gotisches Bauwerk im Landkreis Böblingen, Kirche in der Evangelischen Landeskirche in Württemberg, Kirchengebäude im Landkreis Böblingen, Kirchengebäude in Europa, Kulturdenkmal in Gärtringen, Veitskirche], Die evangelische St.-Veit-Kirche in Gärtringen gilt als eine der besterhaltenen spätgotischen Dorfkirchen Württembergs. Der älteste noch erhaltene Bauteil ist der Turm, der zwischen 1455 und 1460 errichtet wurde. Er stellt mit seiner Höhe von 38,5Metern, die auf die frühere Nutzung als Wehr- und Wachturm zurückzuführen ist, noch heute die dominierende Landmarke des Ortes dar. Das Jahr 1496, in dem der Chor fertiggestellt wurde, gilt als Baujahr der Wandpfeilerkirche., Die durchgängig eingewölbte Dorfkirche besitzt ungewöhnlich reichhaltige spätgotische Gewölbemalereien und wird als Denkmal von besonderer Bedeutung eingestuft. Der sanierungsbedürftige Innenraum der Kirche wurde von Mai 2009 bis September 2010 aufwendig restauriert., Geschichte., Baugeschichte., Der \\"Liber decimationis\\" aus dem Jahr 1275 erwähnt erstmals den Vorgängerbau der heutigen Kirche. Über die Abmessungen des Vorgängerbaus ist wenig bekannt, denn oberirdisch sind keine Überreste erhalten und es gab bisher keine Grabungen im Bereich der Kirche. Ein Hinweis auf das vorherige Kirchenschiff gibt es an der Turmwand im Dachstuhl des Langhauses. Dort ist die alte Giebellinie zu erkennen, woraus zu schließen ist, dass das frühere Langhaus flacher und um 4,5Meter niedriger war als das heutige., Im Jahr 1485, 30Jahre nach Fertigstellung des Turms, begann mit dem Chor der Bau einer geräumigeren Kirche. Er wurde 1496 fertiggestellt und in Gebrauch genommen. Das Langhausgewölbe war schon kurz darauf vollendet, vermutlich zwischen 1498 und 1500. Dies belegen dendrochronologische Untersuchungen der für den Dachstuhl des Langhauses verwendeten Bäume., Als 1869 der Architekt Christian Friedrich von Leins seine Pläne für eine umfassende Renovierung der Kirche entwarf, war die Kirche in den vorherigen Jahrhunderten schon mehrfach repariert und renoviert worden. Von Leins Pläne, die die Kirche weitgehend in einen neugotischen Bau verwandelt hätten, wurden jedoch nicht umgesetzt, sodass der ursprüngliche Baustil und die alte Bausubstanz erhalten blieben. Auch eine 1896 geplante gründliche Restaurierung durch Heinrich Dolmetsch unterblieb. Schließlich nahmen die Architekten Felix Schuster und Theodor Dolmetsch die überfällige Renovierung der Kirche 1913 in Angriff. Entsprechend dem gewandelten historischen Bewusstsein waren sie daran interessiert, das Überlieferte unverfälscht zu bewahren., Eine umfassende Restaurierung des Kircheninneren geschah 1965 unter Leitung des Architekten Paul Heim. Dabei wurde eine Öl-Umluftheizung eingebaut, Wand- und Gewölbemalereien wurden freigelegt und manche Änderungen der Renovierung von 1913 rückgängig gemacht. Eine aufwendige Sanierung des Dachstuhls im Jahr 2007 kostete 480.000Euro., Im Jahr 2008 zeigten sich Risse im Gewölbe, Sandsteinbrocken und Mörtelteile fielen gelegentlich von der Decke. Ein unterhalb der Decke gespanntes Netz schützte deshalb die Besucher vor den herabfallenden Trümmern, bis Mitte Mai 2009 die Renovierungsarbeiten begannen. Bei dieser Sanierung wurden die Gewölberippen, die sich durch Temperaturwechsel und auch durch statische Mängel vom Gewölbe zu lösen begannen, mit Edelstahlkernen an der Gewölbeschale befestigt. Weiterhin wurden die Innenwände gereinigt und das Heizungssystem ersetzt. Die Orgel wurde im Zuge dieser Kirchensanierung gereinigt, modernisiert und um zwei Register erweitert. Am 12. September 2010 wurde die Kirche mit einem Festgottesdienst wieder eröffnet., Kirchengeschichte., Die Pfalzgrafen von Tübingen waren bis ins späte 14. Jahrhundert die Patronatsherren der Kirche. Diese Funktion übernahm 1382 das Haus Württemberg, das 1456 die damit verbundenen Rechte dem \\"Stift Herrenberg\\" übertrug, in das die Kirche 1457 inkorporiert wurde. Nachdem der vertriebene Herzog Ulrich 1534 wieder nach Württemberg zurückgekehrt war, führte er bald die Reformation und den evangelischen Gottesdienst ein. Das Haus Württemberg ließ die in seinem Herrschaftsbereich gelegenen Stifte und Klöster auflösen und übte die Kirchenrechte wieder unmittelbar selbst aus. Die evangelische Landeskirche übernahm den letzten katholischen Pfarrer, Eustachius Kain, in ihren Dienst., Wann der Heilige Veit zum Kirchenheiligen erhoben wurde, ist nicht genau bekannt. Bis 1436 war er eindeutig nur Altar- und Kaplaneiheiliger. Die Verehrung des Heiligen Veit muss Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts bereits beträchtlich gewesen sein, sodass möglicherweise schon die vorherige Kirche ab etwa 1455 dem heiligen Veit geweiht war. Wahrscheinlich wechselte jedoch mit dem Bau der heutigen Kirche das Patrozinium., Baubeschreibung., Die Kirche steht am oberen Rand eines nach Süden und Osten abfallenden Geländes. Die größtenteils noch vorhandene, auf drei Seiten erneuerte Umfassungsmauer deutet durch ihre Höhe auf die einstige Wehrfunktion hin. Auf der Westseite erhebt sich über mächtigen Mauern der quadratische Turm. Seine mit 38,5Metern für eine Dorfkirche recht große Höhe beruht auf seiner ehemaligen Funktion als Wehr- und Wachturm. Der Turm ist zur Kirche ein wenig nach links verschoben. Er steht nicht mittig an der Westseite, sondern springt an der Nordseite ein Stück über das Kirchenschiff hinaus., Der Hauptzugang der Kirche befindet sich in einer kleinen Vorhalle an Turm und Westwand des Langhauses mit nahezu quadratischem Grundriss, die wie der Turm ausgerichtet ist. Das Langhaus ist knapp 20 Meter lang und etwas über 12 Meter breit, einschließlich der Einsatzkapellen. Es ist durch drei Strebepfeiler auf jeder Längsseite in vier Joche gegliedert. Die Westwand des Langhauses ist als einzige Wand des Kirchenschiffs wie der Turm und die Vorhalle ausgerichtet; die inneren Strebepfeiler stoßen nicht rechtwinklig an die Wand des Langhauses, sondern vermitteln zwischen den beiden unterschiedlichen Ausrichtungen. In den Räumen zwischen den Strebepfeilern bestehen Einsatzkapellen mit eigenen Gewölben., Im Osten schließt sich an das Langhaus der Chor an, dessen Breite der des Langhauses ohne die Kapellen entspricht. Chor und Langhaus sind durch einen Chorbogen getrennt. Der Chor ist knapp zwölf Meter lang und weist drei Querachsen sowie einen Dreiachtelschluss auf. Die Ecken des Chorpolygons und die Achsenflanken auf der Südseite sind mit äußeren Strebepfeilern versehen. An die Chornordseite schließt sich die rechteckige Sakristei an, deren Länge zwei Chorachsen entspricht. In der Breite ragt sie ein Stück über die Flucht der Langhausnordwand hinaus., Alle Räume sind mit Rippengewölben versehen, die Vorhalle, das Langhaus mit seinen acht Kapellen, der Chor und die Sakristei besitzen Netzrippengewölbe, die Turmhalle, der älteste Teil der Kirche, hat ein Kreuzrippengewölbe., Turm., Die Turmfassade untergliedert sich in vier Scheingeschosse verschiedener Höhe, die durch umlaufende Gesimse gekennzeichnet sind. Die Mauern bestehen wie der gesamte Bau aus verputzten Bruchsteinen. Nur Eckkanten, Gesimse sowie Tür- und Fenstergewände sind aus sichtbaren Hausteinen gemauert. Den oberen Abschluss bildet das aus der Erbauungszeit stammende Krüppelwalmdach mit Fachwerkgiebeln., Die drei unteren Geschosse haben rechteckige Fensterschlitze, die sich nach innen erweitern. Als Schallöffnung für den Glockenstuhl im vierten Geschoss dient auf jeder Seite ein großes Spitzbogenfenster mit Maßwerkfüllung. In die nach Westen und Osten zeigenden Giebel des Walmdaches sind die Zifferblätter der später hinzugekommenen Turmuhr eingelassen. Auf der Nord- und Südseite sind sie ein Stockwerk tiefer angebracht., Die Gliederung der Stockwerke im Inneren entspricht nicht der Fassadengestaltung. Die aus Eichenholz gezimmerten Turmeinbauten bilden sieben Stockwerke, den Turmdachstuhlboden eingeschlossen. Das Gebälk ruht auf Stufen des Mauerwerks, das sich innen von Stockwerk zu Stockwerk verjüngt., Vorhalle., Die rechteckige, außen schmucklose Vorhalle war mit ziemlicher Sicherheit bei der ursprünglichen Planung der Kirche nicht vorgesehen. Zwar setzt sich in der Vorhalle der Langhaussockel fort, und das Pultdach der Vorhalle schließt genau an das Dachgesims des Langhauses an, aber die Turmtür und der darüberliegende Fensterschlitz grenzen so eng an die Vorhalle, dass von einem nachträglichen Anbau ausgegangen wird. Im Inneren tragen Laubkonsolen das Netzgewölbe, das mit einem Schlussstein abschließt, den eine Darstellung des Kirchenheiligen Veit im Ölkessel ziert., Langhaus., Die einschiffige Kirche ist als Wandpfeilerkirche konstruiert. Das bedeutet, dass die statisch als Widerlager des Gewölbes erforderlichen Strebepfeiler als Wandpfeiler ausgeführt sind, die in der Gärtringer Kirche ganz in den Innenraum eingezogen wurden. Das Kirchenschiff wird damit auf beiden Längsseiten von einer Reihe von Einsatzkapellen flankiert, die durch die Wandpfeiler getrennt sind und sich in hohen Arkaden zur Mitte öffnen. Mit der Klosterkirche Blaubeuren und der Stadtkirche Schwaigern gibt es in Württemberg nur noch zwei weitere Kirchen dieses Typs., Die glatte Außenwand des Langhauses der St.-Veit-Kirche ist durch drei umlaufende Gesimse untergliedert: das Sockel-, das Sohlbank- und das Dachgesims. An der als Schauseite ausgebildeten Südfront befinden sich vier große, dreibahnige, regelmäßig angeordnete Spitzbogenfenster. Das kielbogenförmige Südportal ist etwas östlich der Symmetrieachse des Langhauses platziert, da es sonst auf einen der Strebepfeiler treffen würde. Auf der Nordseite existierten ursprünglich nur zwei Fenster in der ersten und zweiten Einsatzkapelle von Osten, wobei das letzte als einziges Maßwerkfenster des Langhauses nur zweibahnig ist. Die Tür- und Fensterdurchbrüche in der vierten Einsatzkapelle der Nordseite stammen aus späterer Zeit. Die Nordseite ist allerdings durch die hohe Kirchhofmauer weitgehend verdeckt., Das Kirchenschiff wird von einem gleichförmigen Netzgewölbe überspannt, dessen einfach gekehlte Rippen ohne Konsole der Wand entspringen.

Mit ihren Tochterunternehmen beliefert die GASAG über 700.000 Haushalts- und Gewerbekunden mit Erdgas, Bio-Erdgas und Ökostrom, sie ist aber auch Netzbetreiber und Produzent von erneuerbaren Energien sowie Energiedienstleister., Die Geschichte der GASAG begann 1847, als die ersten beiden städtischen Gaswerke in Berlin begannen, Stadtgas zu produzieren. In den 1990er Jahren wurde die GASAG in mehreren Schritten vollständig privatisiert. Seit 1999 gründete die GASAG verschiedene Tochtergesellschaften und entwickelte sich durch Beteiligung an weiteren Energieversorgungs- und Dienstleistungsunternehmen zu der GASAG-Gruppe. Die Gruppe beschäftigt heute über 1500 Mitarbeiter., Geschichte., Die erste Gaserleuchtungs-Anstalt (1825–1844)., Die in London gegründete Imperial Continental Gas Association (ICGA) hatte es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, in den größeren Städten Kontinentaleuropas eine Gasversorgung aufzubauen. Am 25. April 1825 schloss sie für 31.000Thaler im Jahr einen Vertrag mit dem Preußischen Ministerium des Innern und der Polizei über die Gasbeleuchtung der Straßen. Der Vertrag hatte eine Laufzeit von 21Jahren und enthielt das Recht, auch private Brennstellen („Privatflammen“) zu versorgen., Bereits fünf Tage nach Vertragsabschluss erfolgte die Grundsteinlegung für eine „Gaserleuchtungs-Anstalt“ auf einem Gelände (heutiges Sommerbad Kreuzberg) zwischen der \\"Communication am Halleschen Tor\\" (heutige Gitschiner Straße) und dem \\"Floßgraben\\", der ab 1845 zum Landwehrkanal ausgebaut wurde. Am 21.September 1826 meldete die \\"Vossische Zeitung\\" das Brennen der Gaslaternen in der Straße Unter den Linden bis zur Schloßbrücke., Die ICGA baute die Länge des Rohrnetzes bis 1846 auf 100Kilometer aus und versorgte 1019 öffentliche Laternen und 9772 „Privatflammen“. Zwischen der Stadt und der ICGA kam es wegen unverhältnismäßig hoher Gaspreise und nicht durchsetzbarer Forderungen der Behörden nach einem weiteren Ausbau des Gasnetzes zum jahrelangen Streit. In der Folge erhielt die Stadt am 25. August 1844 per königlicher Kabinettsorder die Genehmigung, ab dem 1. Januar 1847 die öffentliche Beleuchtung zu übernehmen., Die Stadt errichtet eigene Gaswerke (1844–1914)., Rudolf Sigismund Blochmann, der in Dresden und Leipzig bereits Gasanstalten gebaut hatte, wurde 1842 mit der Planung zur Gaslieferung an zirka 25.000 Abnahmestellen beauftragt. Vorausschauend hatte die Stadt in unmittelbarer Nähe der englischen Gasanstalten Grundstücke für den Bau der geplanten Gaswerke erworben. Am 1. Juli 1845 war der Baubeginn der beiden ersten städtischen Gaserleuchtungsanstalten. Im nordöstlichen Teil entstand unter der Bauleitung des Sohnes Georg Moritz Sigismund Blochmann die I.Städtische Gasanstalt südlich der Schillingbrücke zwischen Stralauer Platz und der Spree sowie im Südwesten die II.Städtische Gasanstalt (Gaswerk Hellweg) östlich der Prinzenstraße (heute: Böcklerpark) zwischen der Gitschiner Straße und dem damals im Ausbau befindlichen Landwehrkanal. Am 1.Januar 1847 begannen beide Gaswerke mit dem Betrieb und 2055 stadteigene öffentliche Gaslaternen erleuchteten die Innenstadt., Die städtischen Gasanstalten, geleitet durch ein „Curatorium für das städtische Erleuchtungswesen“, hatten keine Gewinne zum Ziel, sondern „den Kostenbeitrag für die öffentliche Beleuchtung in mäßiger Weise zu sichern“. Bedingt durch einen Preiswettbewerb mit der ICGA, die zunehmende Verbreitung von Gasherden und die wachsende Bevölkerung stieg die Zahl der Gasanschlüsse schnell an. Die Gasanstalten versorgten Ende 1847 3.350 öffentliche Gasflammen, 2.164 königliche Gasflammen und 15.114 Privatflammen. Die Gasproduktion steigt von rund fünf Millionen Kubikmeter im Jahr 1850 auf 149Millionen Kubikmeter im Jahr 1890 an. Vier Gaswerke versorgten 1890 insgesamt 27.900 öffentliche Leuchten und 1,5Millionen Privatflammen. Neu gebaut und mehrfach erweitert wurde die GasanstaltIII an der Müllerstraße (Sellerstraße) am Nordhafen sowie Nr.IV an der Danziger/Greifswalder Straße. Das GaswerkV an der Forckenbeckstraße im Ortsteil Schmargendorf folgte 1892 (Stilllegung: 1924) und das Großgaswerk (Nr.VI) in Tegel wurde 1905 eröffnet., Die \\"Städtischen Gaswerke\\" hatten sich zum größten Gasversorger Europas entwickelt. Aufgrund der umfangreichen Verwaltungsarbeiten, zum Beispiel der Erstellung von rund 1,2Millionen Rechnungen pro Jahr, wurde am 26. Oktober 1910 in der \\"Neuen Friedrichstraße\\" 109 (heute: Littenstraße) ein zentrales Verwaltungsgebäude bezogen. Das von Ludwig Hoffmann geplante, denkmalgeschützte Gebäude im Neorenaissance-Stil blieb bis 2002 in Nutzung des GASAG-Konzerns. Es wurde nachfolgend Sitz der privaten BEST-Sabel-Fachhochschule Berlin., Erster Weltkrieg (1914–1918)., In den ersten beiden Jahren des Ersten Weltkriegs stieg die Gasabgabe von 304 auf fast 330Millionenm³, weil die Bevölkerung aufgrund des Kohlenmangels auf Gas auswich. Darüber hinaus wurden kriegswichtige Betriebe neu mit Gas versorgt. Schwere Arbeiten, zum Beispiel Erdarbeiten oder Kohletransporte, wurden 1915/1916 durch Kriegsgefangene oder Auslandsarbeiter in großer Zahl durchgeführt. Kriegsbedingt wurde ab 1917 die Gasentnahme kontingentiert und im Jahr 1919 sogar Sperrstunden für die Entnahme eingeführt., Infolge des Krieges mit England wurde im Juli 1916 die englische Gasgesellschaft ICGA liquidiert. Die Auflösung der ICGA leitete eine grundlegende Umstrukturierung der Gaswirtschaft im Berliner Raum ein. Zwischen der Stadt Berlin, den Kommunen des Umlandes und den staatlichen Behörden kam es zu schweren Konflikten. Die Stadt Berlin war an einer Vereinheitlichung interessiert, während die Regierungsstellen versuchten, die Bestrebungen Berlins zu einem kommunalpolitischen Zusammenschluss in Richtung eines künftigen Groß-Berlins zu unterbinden. Das Angebot des Liquidators einer Minderheitsbeteiligung Berlins wurde durch den Magistrat von Berlin als Affront abgelehnt. Im April 1918 erhielten deshalb die Landkreise Teltow und Niederbarnim den Zuschlag für die gesamte Liquidationsmasse., Umverteilung der Gaspotentiale (1919–1929)., Am 27. April 1920 verabschiedete die Preußische Landesversammlung das Gesetz über die Bildung einer neuen Stadtgemeinde Berlin (Groß-Berlin-Gesetz). Durch den Zusammenschluss von acht Städten, 59 Gemeinden und 27 Gutsbezirken entstand für die Städtischen Gaswerke eine völlig neue Situation. Sie besaß jetzt 16 Gaswerke und Anteile an den Gasgesellschaften der ehemaligen Randgebiete, der \\"Deutschen Gasgesellschaft AG\\" für den Kreis Teltow und der \\"Gasgesellschaft Niederbarnim mbH\\". Nach Übergangsregelungen wurden durch Beschluss der Stadtverordnetenversammlung vom 26. Oktober 1923 drei gleichartige Aktiengesellschaften für die \\"Städtischen Werke\\" (Gas, Wasser, Elektrizität) gebildet, bei denen die Stadt 100 % der Aktien besaß. Die neue Firmenbezeichnung lautete \\"Städtische Gaswerke AG\\". Als Abkürzung bürgerte sich der Begriff \\"Gasag\\" ein., Die kleinen, sehr teuer produzierenden Gemeindegaswerke und die auf 11.375 Mitarbeiter gestiegene Beschäftigungszahl (bei einer Produktionsleistung von 2,172Millionenm³ pro Tag und einer Rohrnetzlänge von 4148Kilometern) zwang die Gasag zur Rationalisierung. 1921 wurden die Gaswerke in Wittenau und Tegel geschlossen, 1922 die Gaswerke \\"Gitschiner Straße\\", LichtenbergI und Heiligensee, 1923 Friedrichshagen und Rahnsdorf, 1924 Schmargendorf und Hermsdorf sowie 1925 Köpenick. Zur Vereinheitlichung der Berliner Gasversorgung gingen die Gaswerke Oberschöneweide und WeißenseeI undII sowie die von ihnen versorgten Gebiete am 1.April 1925 an die Gasag über. Dafür überließ Berlin die versorgten Gebiete im Kreis Niederbarnim dem Kreis kostenlos zur alleinigen Versorgung. Mit dem Anschluss von Falkensee und Staaken im Jahr 1927, Gatow/Kladow (1927/1928), Hennigsdorf (1928) und Wannsee (1929) war die Ausgestaltung des Fernversorgungsnetzes aus heutiger Sicht im Wesentlichen abgeschlossen., Gas im Berlin der 1930er Jahre (1929–1939)., Die Weltwirtschaftskrise von 1929 erfasste auch Berlin. Die Gasabnahme von Haushalten und Industrie ging von Jahr zu Jahr zurück und erreichte 1934 mit 390.000Kubikmeter Jahreserzeugung ihren Tiefpunkt. Die wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse waren so schlecht, dass im Jahr 1931 versucht wurde, die Gasag zu verkaufen. Es fand sich jedoch kein Käufer., Die Gaubehörde der NSDAP empfahl der Stadt 1934, im Laufe der nächsten zehn Jahre mit Investitionen von rund 50Millionen Mark alle Gaswerke auf modernen Kokereibetrieb umzurüsten. Als erste Maßnahme wurde 1935/1936 das Gaswerk Lichtenberg zur Gaskokerei ausgebaut. Die von den Nationalsozialisten herausgegebene Direktive zur stärkeren Nutzung heimischer Rohstoffe führte 1935 zur Inbetriebnahme einer Gastankstelle für Busse der Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe und zum Bau von Anlagen zur Benzolherstellung in den Werken Lichtenberg, Neukölln und Charlottenburg., Im Januar 1937 erfolgte die Umwandlung der \\"Städtischen Gaswerke AG\\" in einen Eigenbetrieb der Stadt unter der Bezeichnung \\"Berliner Städtische Gaswerke (Gasag)\\". Infolge der verbesserten Finanzlage war die Stadt Berlin 1939 in der Lage, dem Kreis Teltow alle Aktien der \\"Deutschen Gesellschaft\\" abzukaufen. Damit vergrößerte sich das städtische Gasversorgungsnetz um 2231Kilometer auf insgesamt 6971Kilometer Länge. Als äußeres Zeichen der nunmehr einheitlichen Besitzverhältnisse im Berliner Raum wurde der Name des Eigenbetriebes auf \\"Berliner Gaswerke\\" geändert., Krieg und Nachkriegszeit (1939–1949)., Nach Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs stieg der Gasbedarf durch die Anforderungen der Rüstungsindustrie bis zum Jahr 1942 auf die Rekordabgabe von 871Millionen Kubikmeter pro Jahr. 93 % der 1,48Millionen Berliner Haushalte kochten mit Gas, mit 86.000 Gaslaternen erreichte die Gasbeleuchtung ihren Höchststand und aufgrund der Benzinknappheit fuhren bis 1944 mehr als 2500 Nutzfahrzeuge mit Gas., Trotz der Luftangriffe der Alliierten und der kriegsbedingten Schäden blieb die städtische Gasversorgung bis zum Beginn der unmittelbaren Kampfhandlungen im April 1945 voll in Funktion. Nach der Schlacht um Berlin und dem Kriegsende lag Berlin in Schutt und Asche. Von den 38 großen Gasbehältern war einer unbeschädigt und nur ein Prozent des 7000Kilometer langen Rohr: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Abkürzung, Berlin-Mitte, Dienstleistungsunternehmen, Elektrizitätsversorger, Gasversorger, Gegründet 1847, Vattenfall-Unternehmen, Energieunternehmen, Energieversorger, Tochterunternehmen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Aves, Fossiler Vogel, Vögel], \\"Gastornis\\" ist eine ausgestorbene Gattung großer, flugunfähiger Vögel aus der näheren Verwandtschaft der Gänsevögel. Sie war vom Mittleren Paläozän bis zum Mittleren Eozän vor 62 bis 43 Millionen Jahren sowohl im heutigen Eurasien als auch in Nordamerika verbreitet. Die ersten Fossilien der Gattung \\"Gastornis\\" wurden 1855 nahe Paris entdeckt und noch im selben Jahr erstbeschrieben. Die ältesten nordamerikanischen Funde stammen aus dem Jahr 1876 und wurden ursprünglich zur Gattung Diatryma gestellt. Über lange Zeit galten beide Gattungen als eigenständig, wofür zum Teil eine fehlerhafte Rekonstruktion aus dem Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts verantwortlich war. Erst Anfang der 1990er-Jahre wurde erkannt, dass \\"Diatryma\\" und \\"Gastornis\\" nahe miteinander verwandt sind, neue Knochenfunde aus Frankreich führten schließlich zu Synonymisierung von \\"Diatryma\\" mit \\"Gastornis\\"., Über lange Zeit wurde \\"Gastornis\\" als wendiger, auf Fleischnahrung spezialisierter Beutegreifer angesehen, der hauptsächlich Jagd auf kleinere Säugetiere machte und in Verbindung mit seiner Größe, die bis knapp über 2m betrug, einen Spitzenprädator seiner Zeit repräsentierte. Die Ansicht ging einher mit einem den südamerikanischen „Terrorvögeln“ (Phorusrhacidae) ähnelnden Skelettbau, der anhand eines nahezu vollständigen, 1916 entdeckten Skelettfundes aus Wyoming erarbeitet wurde. Teilweise beruhte diese Ähnlichkeit aber auf fehlerhaften Annahmen zur Länge einzelner Knochen im Fußskelett. Erst in den 1970er-Jahren konnte durch Neufunde von Fußknochen das Bild des wendigen Läufers korrigiert werden. Demnach stellte \\"Gastornis\\" aufgrund des Körperbaus einen sich eher langsam fortbewegenden, bodenbewohnenden Vogel dar. Die Ernährungsweise war lange Zeit ungeklärt. Neben der Spezialisierung auf Fleischnahrung wurde immer wieder eine rein pflanzliche Ernährung diskutiert, die sich vorwiegend aus anatomischen Erwägungen wie der Größe des Tiers und dem Bau des Schnabels ergab. Mehrere unabhängige Untersuchungen aus dem Jahr 2013 bestätigen vorerst die Ansicht der Spezialisierung auf Pflanzennahrung., Merkmale., Habitus., \\"Gastornis\\" war ein sehr großer und robust gebauter, flugunfähiger Vogel, der eine Scheitelhöhe von 1,75 bis etwas über 2m erreichte. Dabei waren europäische Vertreter im Durchschnitt etwas kleiner als nordamerikanische. Das Körpergewicht betrug für die frühen Formen in Europa schätzungsweise etwa 100kg, bei späteren zwischen 135 und 156kg, teilweise auch bis 180kg. Gewichtsspannen für die durchschnittlich größeren Individuen aus Nordamerika reichen von 160 bis 229kg. Damit war er einer der größten und schwersten bekannten Vögel. Besondere Merkmale der Vertreter von \\"Gastornis\\" stellten der große Kopf mit einem mächtigen Schnabel, der kurze, aber kräftige Hals und die massiven Beine dar, deren untere Abschnitte eher kurz gestaltet waren. Wie bei den heutigen großen flugunfähigen Vögeln wiesen die Flügel in ihrer Länge stark reduzierte Knochen auf., Schädel und Schnabel., Der Schädel war sehr groß und maß bei einem vollständigen Exemplar 43cm, der mächtige Schnabel nahm davon 23cm ein. Dieser war zudem sehr hoch, insgesamt 16,5cm, und seitlich stark verschmälert. Die Schnabeloberseite wies eine deutlich konvexe Krümmung auf, während die Schnabelspitze nicht hakenartig verlängert war. Vor allem durch letzteres Merkmal unterscheidet sich \\"Gastornis\\" deutlich von den ähnlich gebauten Phorusrhacidae („Terrorvögel“). Die äußeren Nasenlöcher befanden sich etwa 5cm vor der Orbita und nahe der Unterkante des Schnabels. Sie waren klein und nach vorn gerichtet. Auch hier bestehen Unterschiede zu den Phorusrhaciden, deren Nasenlöcher häufig direkt am Augenfenster ansetzen. Die Orbita selbst war von einem kräftigen und prominent erhöhten Wulst umgeben. Das für Vögel typische Quadratbein zeichnete sich durch seine Größe aus, war aber insgesamt eher kurz und gedrungen. Die Jochbeinbögen wiesen ebenfalls einen kurzen Bau auf und verliefen in einer S-Kurve. Der gesamte hinter den Augenfenstern ansetzende Hinterschädel besaß im Gegensatz zum massiven Schnabel nur eine geringe Ausdehnung., Der Unterkiefer war massiv, bis zu 38cm lang und am Knochenkörper mit bis zu 10cm sehr hoch. Beide Unterkieferhälften waren durch die Symphyse im vorderen Bereich fest miteinander verwachsen, das vordere Ende lief spitz aus. Die Verbindung reichte teils über eine Länge von 18cm und nahm so fast die Hälfte der Gesamtlänge des Unterkiefers ein, was für Vögel ungewöhnlich ist., Körperskelett., Die Wirbelsäule ist nicht vollständig bekannt, allgemein zeichneten sich die Wirbel aber durch ihre Robustheit und ihren kurzen Wirbelkörper aus. Der Hals wurde aus 13 oder 14 Wirbeln gebildet. Am Rücken befanden sich sieben rippentragende Wirbel. Die dort ansetzenden Rippen waren dünn und weit gebogen. Der Schwanz umfasste zehn oder mehr Wirbel. Die Vordergliedmaßen waren stark verkümmert. Typisch für flugunfähige Vögel war der stumpfe Winkel zwischen Schulterblatt und Rabenbein, der 180° erreichte, ähnlich wie bei den zweibeinig laufenden Dinosauriern mit verkürzten Vordergliedmaßen, aber im Gegensatz zu den flugfähigen Vögeln, bei denen der Winkel unter 90° liegt. Die Hinterbeine dagegen waren äußerst kräftig ausgebildet. Der Oberschenkelknochen erreichte über 38cm Länge und war am unteren Gelenkende gut 10cm breit. Der Tibiotarsus maß fast 60cm und wies einen geraden Schaft auf. Das Wadenbein wirkte demgegenüber sehr grazil. Mit rund 25cm Länge sehr kurz und eher breit war der Tarsometatarsus gestaltet. Die Beine endeten in vierstrahligen Füßen, von denen drei Strahlen nach vorn (II bis IV) ragten und einer (I) nach hinten stand. Von den drei nach vorn weisenden Zehen besaß der mittlere (III) die größte Länge, was unterschiedlich zu den ebenfalls riesigen Moas mit drei gleich langen Strahlen ist. Der kürzeste Strahl war der nach hinten zeigende. Die Endphalangen wiesen eine nur kurze Form und einen dreieckigen Querschnitt auf. In der Längsansicht waren sie nur wenig gekrümmt, was sie wiederum von den Phorusrhaciden unterscheidet., Biogeographie., Fossilfunde., \\"Gastornis\\" ist sowohl in Europa als auch in Nordamerika nachgewiesen. Die europäischen Funde datieren in die Zeit vom Mittleren Paläozän bis zum Mittleren Eozän vor 62 bis etwa 41 Millionen Jahren. Zu den ältesten Nachweisen gehören die spärlichen Überreste von Walbeck im westlichen Sachsen-Anhalt, die in das Seelandium vor rund 60 Millionen Jahren datieren. Unter ihnen befindet sich unter anderem ein 7cm langes Rabenbein. Die umfangreichsten Funde des Kontinents sind aus dem Geiseltal bekannt. Sie umfassen mehr als drei Dutzend Fundobjekte, darunter größtenteils Reste der Laufbeine und des Beckens, aber auch Flügelknochen und Teile des Schädels wie dem Unterkiefer. Sie können insgesamt neun Individuen zugewiesen werden und verteilen sich über die Unterkohle bis zur Oberen Mittelkohle der Fundstelle, datieren somit ins Mittlere Eozän vor rund 47 bis 43 Millionen Jahren. Die Funde der oberen Mittelkohle sind gleichzeitig die jüngsten \\"Gastornis\\"-Funde überhaupt. Gleich alt zur Geiseltaler Unterkohle ist ein singulärer Fund in Form eines etwa 30cm langen Oberschenkelknochens aus der Grube Messel in Hessen, der sich in einer Gesteinsknolle befand. Er war bereits Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts während des Bergbaubetriebs gefunden worden, konnte aber erst in den 1960er Jahren sicher zugewiesen werden. Dagegen sind vom Mont-de-Berru bei Reims im Ostteil des Pariser Becken wiederum zahlreiche Reste bekannt. Sie sind etwas jünger als jene von Walbeck und repräsentieren unter anderem zahlreiche Laufbeinreste. Ein Unterkiefer von der gleichen Lokalität ist mit 31cm Länge noch deutlich kleiner als derjenige der späteren Vertreter. Aus der gleichen Region und ebenfalls dem ausgehenden Paläozän angehörend kamen Funde, vor allem Reste des Bewegungsapparates, aus Louvois zu Tage. Zu den südlichsten europäischen Resten sind des Weiteren einige Beinknochen, Wirbel und ein 18cm langer und 17cm hoher Rest eines Oberschnabels aus Saint-Papoul im Département Aude im südlichen Frankreich zu rechnen. Darüber hinaus fanden sich Fossilien von \\"Gastornis\\" in London und in Belgien., Die bekannten nordamerikanischen Funde sind alle dem Unteren Eozän vor 56 bis 49 Millionen Jahren zuzuweisen und verteilen sich auf über 50 Fundstellen. Hervorzuheben ist dabei eines der wenigen vollständigen Skelette, das rekonstruiert bis zu 2,1m hoch ist. Dieses stammt aus dem Bighorn-Becken im US-Bundesstaat Wyoming. Es wurde bereits Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts entdeckt und ist das Resultat zahlreicher vorangegangener, tiefgründiger Untersuchungen, bei denen schon zuvor einige Bein- und Fußknochen zum Vorschein gekommen waren. Aus dem gleichen Becken stammt aus der Willwood-Formation eine größere Kollektion, die auch Schädel- und Beinreste sowie Wirbelfunde beinhaltet. Weitere Funde kamen darüber hinaus in New Mexico zum Vorschein. Hier ist vor allem ein Tarsometatarsus von Bedeutung, der im Jahr 1876 zur Aufstellung der Gattung \\"Diatryma\\" führte. Wenige Knochenreste konnten auch aus der untereozänen Margaret-Formation auf Ellesmere Island im arktischen Norden Kanadas beschrieben werden. Diese stellen die nördlichsten bekannten Funde von \\"Gastornis\\" überhaupt dar. Aus Asien sind nur wenige Reste bekannt, die ebenfalls ein untereozänes Alter aufweisen. Hierzu gehört ein unteres Ende eines großen Tibiotarsus aus der Yuhuangding-Formation in der chinesischen Provinz Henan. Dieser wurde 1980 als zur nahe mit \\"Gastornis\\" verwandten Gattung \\"Zhongyuanus\\" beschrieben, eine Revision im Jahr 2013 ergab aber keine bedeutenden morphologischen Unterschiede zu \\"Gastornis\\"., Weichteile, Eier und Spurenfossilien., Neben fossilen Knochenresten sind nur wenige Überbleibsel des Weichteilgewebes bekannt. Bereits in den 1920er Jahren waren Federfunde vom Loan Creek im westlichen US-Bundesstaat Colorado beschrieben worden, die gut 20cm lang waren und aus der Green-River-Formation stammten. Diese erwiesen sich nach genaueren Untersuchungen als Reste von Pflanzenfasern.
