It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - BBC White City, also known as the BBC Media Village (or W12 within the BBC), is a collection of six buildings occupying a 17-acre site at Wood Lane, White City in West London (W12). All formerly properties of the BBC, several have now closed, with only Broadcast Centre and the Lighthouse currently occupied by BBC staff. The site is a short distance down Wood Lane from the former BBC Television Centre.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London.

Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - Wood Lane (A219, formerly A40) is a street in London.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Laura Topham. PUBLISHED:. 20:31 EST, 2 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 20:31 EST, 2 November 2013. The X Factor has been criticised by fans for ‘shamelessly’ plugging sponsors’ products  on last Saturday’s programme. During the two-hour ITV talent show, contestants were repeatedly shown using Samsung products  – and on another occasion, a TV catch-up service from another sponsor was featured. The first sighting of an item provided by electronics giant Samsung came within minutes – when boy-band Rough Copy used what appeared to be one of its smart cameras to take pictures of themselves at a film premiere. Snap: Abi Alton's Samsung plug on the X Factor where she is shown having her picture taken on one of the South Korean company's Galaxy smartphones. Soon afterwards singers Abi Alton and Luke Friend had photos taken with the brand’s mobile phones. Other contestants were then shown using Samsung’s tablet – including Nicholas McDonald, who made a video call to his mother, and Tamera Foster, who watched a video with mentor Nicole Scherzinger. Boy-band Kingsland Road later reviewed their performance using the subscription-free TV service, YouView, from another show sponsor, TalkTalk. Fans expressed their anger on Twitter. Aisha Mohammed wrote: ‘I hate X Factor for their shameless product placement’. And Phil Holmes said he had developed a new game counting ‘how many times X Factor can shoehorn in’ Samsung products. Gadgets: Other contestants were then shown using Samsung¿s tablet, including Tamera Foster, who watched a video with mentor Nicole Scherzinger (centre) Product placement has been allowed on UK TV programmes since February 2011. But regulator Ofcom stipulates there must be ‘editorial justification’ for a product – meaning content should not seem manipulated or distorted in order to include it. An ITV spokesman said: ‘Editorial integrity is at the  heart of what we do. Product placement on The X Factor complies with all regulations.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The X Factor, a popular talent show on ITV, faced backlash from fans for \\"shamelessly\\" promoting sponsors' products during one of their episodes in November 2013. Viewers criticized the show for repeatedly featuring contestants using Samsung products, such as smartphones and tablets, and promoting a catch-up service from another sponsor, TalkTalk. Fans expressed their frustration on Twitter, accusing the show of excessive product placement. Product placement has been allowed on UK TV programs since February 2011, but the broadcasting regulator Ofcom stipulates that there must be \\"editorial justification\\" for a product to be featured. This means that the content should not appear manipulated or distorted to make room for the product placement. In response to the criticism, an ITV spokesperson stated that editorial integrity is at the heart of what they do, and that The X Factor's product placement was in compliance with all regulations. Despite the backlash, it is important to recognize that product placements are often a necessary part of a television show's funding strategy. Shows like The X Factor need the financial support from sponsors to continue being produced, and product placements can be an effective way for both the program and the sponsors to benefit. Responsible product placement ensures that the advertising messages do not overwhelm the show's content and that they are integrated seamlessly into the program. While the program can receive sponsorship from companies, it is crucial for its producers and broadcasters to maintain a balance between advertising and the overall quality of the show, both for the sake of the audience's enjoyment and to comply with regulations established by broadcasting authorities. In conclusion, while product placement can be an important source of funding for television programs, it is necessary for both broadcasters and producers to adhere to regulatory guidelines and focus on maintaining editorial integrity in order to avoid backlash from viewers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The police arrested two homeless people.

Please answer the following question: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which region had more sulfate reduction?  Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -21*m + 134 = -13 for m.","output":"This is an algebraic equation and we need to solve for the variable m. Here's how we can solve this step by step: Given equation: -21*m + 134 = -13  Step 1: Re-arrange the equation to move the constant 134 to the other side of the equation. You can do this by subtracting 134 from both sides of the equation: -21*m +134 -134 = -13 -134 Which simplifies to: -21*m = -147  Step 2: Now we need to isolate m on one side. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -21.  (-21*m) / -21 = -147/-21 Which simplifies to: m = 7 So, the solution to the equation -21*m + 134 = -13 for m is m = 7. This means that when m = 7, the equation is true. You can check this by substituting m=7 back into the original equation: -21*7 + 134 = -147 + 134 = -13 Hence, the solution is correct. So, the value of m that satisfies the equation -21*m + 134 = -13 is m=7."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Somnath Bharti (born 10 May 1974) is an Indian lawyer who has become a politician representing the Aam Admi Party (AAP).

Here's a simpler explanation: Circadian rhythm is like the body's internal timer that tells us when to wake up, eat, and sleep. Many, many years ago, it evolved or developed in early living things. Scientists think it happened to protect these early life forms.  You know how you're told not to stay out in the sun too long because you might get a sunburn? Well, the sun can also be harmful to DNA, the building blocks of life in every creature. The circadian rhythm helped these early life forms avoid getting their DNA \\"sunburnt\\" by ensuring they keep away from strong sunlight during the daytime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, a town destructed for the fourth time in 14 years by a major tornado , are a reminder that current building codes  can't do much to prevent property destruction and loss of life, especially when a powerful tornado cuts through town. But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms.  In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms.   \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said.  Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced.  As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction. Similar proposals were made following each of the previous tornado strikes, but none were adopted. Question: According to Chapman Henderson, which of the following does she probably agree with? Options: A: Building codes make a difference in preventing property destruction. B: If people take shelter in safe rooms, nobody will die. C: It is urgent to build tornado safe rooms. D: Safe rooms can be built only underground. The answer to this question is:","output":"C: It is urgent to build tornado safe rooms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, (9 May 1860 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland but moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in \\"The Little White Bird\\"), then to write \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\", a \\"fairy play\\" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.  - Neverland is a fictional location featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them. It is an imaginary faraway place, where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and other mythical creatures and beings live. Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism. It was first introduced as \\"the Never Never Land\\" in the theatre play \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\" by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, first staged in 1904.  - Immortality is eternal life, the ability to live forever. At least one species has potential biological immortality: \\"Turritopsis dohrnii\\".  - Escapism is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of daily life. It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persisting feelings of depression or general sadness.  - The Little White Bird is a British novel by J. M. Barrie, ranging in tone from fantasy and whimsy to social comedy with dark, aggressive undertones. It was published in November 1902, by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK and Scribner's in the US, although the latter had released it serially in the monthly \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" from August to November. The book attained prominence and longevity thanks to several chapters written in a softer tone than the rest of the book, which introduced the character and mythology of Peter Pan. In 1906, those chapters were published separately as a children's book, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.  - Childhood is the age span ranging from birth to adolescence. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, childhood consists of two stages: preoperational stage and concrete operational stage. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of toddlerhood (learning to walk), early childhood (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation.  - A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.  - The works of J. M. Barrie about Peter Pan feature many memorable characters . The numerous adaptations and sequels to those stories feature many of the same characters , and introduce new ones . Most of these strive for continuity with Barrie 's work , developing a fairly consistent cast of characters living in Neverland and the real - world settings of Barrie 's stories .  - Wendy is a given name generally given to females in English-speaking countries.  - Peter Pan is a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include a 1953 animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action film, a TV series and many other works.  - Kensington Gardens, once the private gardens of Kensington Palace, are among the Royal Parks of London. They gardens are shared by the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and sit immediately to the west of Hyde Park, in western central London. The gardens cover an area of 270 acres. The open spaces of Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James's Park together form an almost continuous \\"green lung\\" in the heart of London. Kensington Gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.   - The Davies boys (the family only used the double surname Llewelyn Davies in formal contexts) were the sons of Arthur (18631907) and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (18661910), the daughter of the French-born cartoonist and writer George du Maurier and sister of actor Gerald du Maurier. The boys were the first cousins of Gerald's daughter, the author Daphne du Maurier. They were the inspiration for J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, in which several of the characters were named after them.  - Tinker Bell (Tink for short), is a fictional character from J. M. Barrie's 1904 play \\"Peter Pan\\" and its 1911 novelization \\"Peter and Wendy\\". She has appeared in multiple film and television adaptations of the Peter Pan stories, in particular the 1953 animated Walt Disney picture \\"Peter Pan\\". She also appears in the official sequel \\"Peter Pan in Scarlet\\" by Geraldine McCaughrean commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital as well as the \\"Peter and the Starcatchers\\" book series by Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry.   - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A Michigan man will spend life in prison for beating and strangling to death his girlfriend before chopping up and skinning her body to hide the evidence. William Dhondt, 29, was found guilty of first degree murder Friday in the grisly 2013 killing of Kaitlin Hehir, 29, in the Farmington home they shared. It took the jury only three hours to reach a verdict. The convicted killer told investigators in a taped interrogation played for the jury during his trial that he ‘sliced and diced’ Hehir’s corpse ‘like she was pot roast or some s**t,’ according to The Oakland Press. Better times: Kaitlin Hehir and William Dhondt shown in a picture posted online only months before her horrifying murder. At least one member of the jury was crying as the Dhondt’s guilty verdict for the Feb 23, 2013 slaughter of Hehir was read aloud, according to the Detroit Free-Press.  He showed no emotion. The murder was so horrific, and the evidence so graphic, that jurors are going to be provided counseling by the court after the week-long trial, according to the paper. Guilty: Dhondt will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Hehir’s family was present for the verdict, and more than one friend found satisfaction in hearing the word guilty before seeing the killer led out of the courtroom. ‘Sweet angel… he won’t ever hurt anyone again,’ Hehir’s friend Maria Ellis wrote on Facebook in the hours after trial wrapped. ‘Justice was served,’ another friend commented. Investigators showed up at the couple’s Farmington home the day after the murder when Dhondt called to report her missing – they soon obtained a search warrant and found her remains scattered throughout the house, jurors were told. The killing happened only one week after a glowing Hehir wrote on Facebook of her love for her soon-to-be killer on Valentine's Day. 'Flowers and strawberries?!?' She posted. 'I'm a very lucky girl. Thank you to my amazing boyfriend!' The wicked depravity of the death only came to light when he admitted his guilt to police in the shockingly graphic confession played in court. Dhondt told detectives he and Hehir became embroiled in a fight when she became upset after having to leave a party to pick him up at work. She had been drinking and was throwing up when they returned, he tried to give her a glass of water – she responded to the gesture by kicking him in the groin, he recalled. Then he snapped, ‘I f*****g laid her out,’ he bragged. ‘The defendant described hitting Kaitlin in the face with a glass cup, causing her to hit her head on a dresser and fall to the ground,’ Farmington Police Detective Andrew Morche said during Dhondt's arraignment last year, according to Michigan Live. 'Sweet angel': Friend Mary Ellis (left) wrote online that Dhondt 'won't ever hurt anyone again' after he was found guilty of murdering Hehir (right) Evidence: Police were shown the day after slaying leaving the home with bags of evidence. ‘She cracked her head on the dresser, and she was out, and that’s where I freaked out,’ he continued. ‘The defendant got on top of Kaitlin and hit her multiple times in the face with his fist, causing her to bleed from the nose and mouth,’ Morche continued. ‘I didn’t know where this was going to end, and I was an idiot,’ he told investigators. ‘The defendant slammed Kaitlin's head into the floor repeatedly, causing her to bleed form her head,’ Morche testified. ‘The defendant then used his hands to strangle Kaitlin to death while she struggled and fought for her life.’ ‘I choked her, to make sure,’ he told cops. Dhondt described how Hehir’s lifeless body lay on the floor for nearly two hours while he tried to figure out how to proceed. ‘Then my mind went off — ‘Let’s get rid of it.’ He dragged Hehir’s corpse to the basement and chopped it into pieces that he then stuffed in garbage bags, police said. Butchered: Dhondt admitted to police that he used a saw similar tot he one at right to cut through Hehir's bones and an X-Acto knife similar to the one at left to strip them of skin and muscles. ‘I took care of that and went to bed. I woke up, said ‘That’s not going to work,’ so I skinned her,’ Dhondt admitted, ‘removed flesh.’ Prosecutor Tricia Dare told jurors in graphic detail how he skinned the already mutilated body with an X-Acto knife and then went about removing the muscles before using a power saw to get through bones. ‘He tried to use a sawsall,’ she said, according to Macomb Daily. ‘Can you imagine what that must have been like, to use an X-Acto knife to cut the flesh of another human being? ‘And when he got to the bone, he got out a saw.’ Dare said Dhondt removing skin and muscles from Hehir’s arms was ‘like she’s an animal that he just hunted out in the woods.’ Where it happened: The Farmington home shared by Dhondt and Hehir. ‘He talks about it like it’s nothing — ‘Well, that way I can put it in the garbage and people will just think it’s salmon. … It’s not salmon. That’s a person,’ Dare continued. Displaying a total lack of awareness to the sorrow felt by his victim’s loved ones, Dhondt actually told police the aftermath ‘sucks’ because ‘it was probably four minutes of the worst thing that ever happened to me.’ Dhondt and his lawyer tried to paint Hehir as a cruel, belittling woman who often abused him, leading to the brutal slaying. The attorney pleaded in her closing statement for him to be convicted of voluntary manslaughter. He was found guilty of first-degree murder only hours later. The conviction carries a mandatory life sentence in Michigan which will be formally announced during an April 18 hearing. It is not clear if Dhondt will appeal the verdict, but his attorney told reporters gathered outside the courtroom the decision 'shocked' her.

One day, Joe's best friend, Alice, and several others from their town, mysteriously disappear. The police are either too afraid or too corrupted to take action against the powerful crime lord. Determined to find and free his friend and the other captives, Joe investigates Victor's activities. Infiltrating the crime lord's organization, he discovers the location of the underground prison. Joe realizes that he needs a plan to execute this dangerous rescue mission. Remembering his father's firecrackers, he decides to use them as a distraction. Joe enlists the help of Cary, who creates a set of custom-made firecrackers with maximum power and impact. They devise a plan to cause chaos and confusion among Victor's henchmen, which will provide Joe with a window of opportunity to free Alice and the other prisoners. On the night of the rescue mission, Joe breaks into the underground prison, where he plants the firecrackers throughout the compound.

But critics say the move is aimed at protecting cows, considered holy by India's majority Hindu population. The men, who killed the calf on Saturday, said they wanted to represent people's anger against the federal government's decision. The Congress party, the main opposition to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), opposes the ban, but it suspended the three members of its youth wing, saying the act was \\"thoughtless and barbaric\\". The ban has sparked protests from a number of state governments.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Lolita Context: The film begins in a quarrell between two men at a remote mansion. Humbert Humbert (James Mason) a 40-something British professor of French literature, arrives at the masion which is ramsacked from an apparently wild party the night before and finds the insane and debauched Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), whom is not only suffering from some kind of severe dementia, but is also clearly drunk, as he babbles on incoherently and does not seem to remember Humbert from a time ago. Quilty goes mad when Humbert points a gun at him. After a mutually exhausting struggle for it, Quilty, now insane with fear, merely responds politely as Humbert repeatedly shoots him. He finally dies with a comical lack of interest, expressing his slight concern in an affected English accent. Humbert is left exhausted and disoriented.The film then turns to events four years earlier and goes forward as Humbert travels to Ramsdale, New Hampshire, a small town where he will spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches across the town for room to let, being tempted by widowed, sexually famished mother, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her beautiful 14-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze (Sue Lyon), affectionately called Lolita (hence the title). Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-chewing, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert falls hopelessly in love.In order to become close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. Soon, however, Charlotte announces that she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleep-away camp for the summer. On the morning of departure, Humbert receives a love confession note from Charlotte, asking Humbert to leave at once.

Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. Learning that she has posed for Sordi and become the subject of the latest in the artist's series of \\"Dead Red Nudes,\\" he visits her sister Donna (Sandra Knight) to ask her forgiveness. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off.

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   of pivot point, and so we choose the pivot point to simplify the solution of the problem. Second, the acceleration due to gravity canceled in this problem, and we were left with a ratio of masses. This will not always be the case. Always enter the correct forces—do not jump ahead to enter some ratio of masses. Third, the weight of each child is distributed over an area of the seesaw, yet we treated the weights as if each force were exerted at a single point. This is not an approximation—the distances r 1 and r 2 are the distances to points directly below the center of gravity of each child. As we shall see in the next section, the mass and weight of a system can act as if they are located at a single point. Finally, note that the concept of torque has an importance beyond static equilibrium. Torque plays the same role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion. We will examine this in the next chapter. Take-Home Experiment Take a piece of modeling clay and put it on a table, then mash a cylinder down into it so that a ruler can balance on the round side of the cylinder while everything remains still. Put a penny 8 cm away from the pivot. Where would you need to put two pennies to balance? Three pennies?.   Q: What plays the same role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion.   A: Choose from:  + efficiency.  + frame.  + fulcrum.  + torque. Answer:","output":"The role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion is torque. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that \\"Torque plays the same role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion.\\" This means that torque is responsible for causing or influencing the rotation of an object, just like force is responsible for causing or changing the motion of an object in linear motion.

During this time, the rapid growth of the internet inspired Bezos to build an online store that could cater to the needs of a large consumer base. He made a list of items that could potentially sell well online and eventually decided that books would be the most suitable choice to kick start his business. By narrowing down his focus to books, Bezos aimed to create an efficient platform that offered customers a broader selection and convenient shopping experience compared to what brick-and-mortar bookstores could provide. The Amazon website initially went live in 1995 as an online bookstore. It quickly gained popularity, and within a month, Amazon had sold books to customers across the United States and 45 other countries. The company expanded its product offerings over the years to include electronics, clothing, toys, and more. In 1998, Amazon entered the online music and video retailing market, further broadening its product range. Under the leadership of Jeff Bezos, Amazon has continuously evolved and expanded to different areas and services. The company launched its popular Amazon Prime membership program in 2005, which offers members free and fast shipping, access to streaming of movies, TV shows, and music, among other benefits. Amazon entered the global e-reader market in 2007 by unveiling the Kindle e-reader, which has since transformed the way people read books and consume digital content. Today, Amazon is one of the world's largest online retailers and a prominent technology company that offers a diverse range of products and services. In addition to its e-commerce platform, Amazon operates in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), artificial intelligence with Alexa, and the development of new technologies and devices, such as the Echo line of smart speakers. Jeff Bezos's decision to build Amazon from a small online bookstore into a global technology giant has made him one of the wealthiest people in the world. His leadership and determination to focus on long-term growth and innovation have significantly impacted the e-commerce and technology landscape, with Amazon playing a crucial role in shaping modern consumer behavior and expectations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The site also features historic burial grounds .  - The archaeological record is the body of physical (not written) evidence about the past. It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.  - A stockade is an enclosure of palisades and tall walls made of logs placed side by side vertically with the tops sharpened to provide security.   - A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.  and the situation: Two researchers looked at the human influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Tim studied a human settlement from 10000 years ago, while Bob studied a present day county. Today's economy in the county revolved around extensive agriculture.  Answer the following question: Which researcher found no evidence of cut forests? A:","output":"There are two researchers mentioned: Tim and Bob. Tim studied a human settlement from 10,000 years ago, while Bob studied a present-day county with an economy revolving around extensive agriculture. To answer the question, we need to determine which of the researchers found no evidence of cut forests. Step 1: Understand the background information The background information states that cutting forests and clearing land increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not only because it reduced the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide, but also because burning releases carbon dioxide stored in those autotrophs. Step 2: Evaluate Tim's research Tim studied a human settlement from 10,000 years ago. Human activities at that time were less advanced and likely not as widespread as they are today. It is possible that forest cutting happened but not on the scale it does today. Step 3: Evaluate Bob's research Bob studied a present-day county with an economy based on extensive agriculture. Agriculture on a large scale often involves land clearance and deforestation. Large-scale agriculture usually requires clearing of forests, which, as mentioned in the background information, contributes to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Step 4: Compare and answer the question Comparing the two cases, Tim's research based on a human settlement 10,000 years ago is less likely to have evidence for cut forests than Bob's research on a present-day county dependent on extensive agriculture. Therefore, the researcher who found no evidence of cut forests is most likely Tim (A)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long did it take for Chihuly to create the sculpture suspended over the V&A museum?

Plot title: Ryan's Daughter Movie plot: The film takes place in the isolated village of Killary on the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland during World War I. The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting Michael (John Mills) (the mute village idiot) and British soldiers stationed at a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as \\"our boys\\".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village. Rosy is in love with the local schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum), a widower older than herself. She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage. She is looking for passion beyond just love in her relationship.Major Randolph Doryan (Christopher Jones) arrives to take command of the local army base. A veteran of World War I, he has been awarded a Victoria Cross, but has a crippled leg and suffers from shell shock. Rosy is instantly attracted to him. When Michael absent-mindedly bangs his foot on the pub bench, it causes Doryan to have a flashback to the trenches and collapse. When he recovers, he is comforted by Rosy. The two passionately kiss until they are interrupted by the arrival of Ryan and the townspeople.

By Louise Cheer Vegetable growers hope celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's star power will help convince Woolworths to cancel a 40-cent-per-crate of food levy to be imposed by the supermarket to fund the Jamie's Garden promotion, a charge that could cost farmers thousands of dollars each. The group that represents growers, Ausveg, wrote to Oliver on Tuesday asking him to step in after farmers expressed outrage at being charged an extra 40 cents per crate, on top of the up-to five per cent of the total cost of produce they are already charged to cover marketing costs. Mr Oliver's publicity manager Peter Berry  said from London that the chef was aware of what was being said, but did not confirm if the media personality had received the letter, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 'At the end of the day, OPTIONS: - Ausveg supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Jamie Oliver supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Jamie's Garden supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - London supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Louise Cheer supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Oliver supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Peter Berry supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Sydney Morning Herald supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. - Woolworths supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said.","output":"At the end of the day, Jamie Oliver supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. As the story unfolds, tensions between the vegetable growers and the supermarket chain continue to grow. However, Jamie Oliver does not want his name and reputation to be tainted by the controversy surrounding the 40-cent-per-crate levy. In an effort to find a solution that appeases all parties involved, Jamie Oliver reaches out to Woolworths and recommends that they cancel the levy. He suggests that a meeting should be held between Woolworths, Ausveg, and himself to discuss alternative ways to fund the Jamie's Garden promotion without putting additional financial burdens on the farmers. Woolworths agrees to the meeting and considers how they can compromise on the situation. Meanwhile, Ausveg and the farmers are thrilled that Jamie Oliver is intervening. They have always respected him for his commitment to food education and healthy eating and see this as a sign that he truly cares about their well-being. The meeting takes place and several possible funding solutions are proposed, including redirecting funds from other marketing initiatives, voluntary donations from customers, or even corporate sponsorship from other companies that share Jamie's vision for promoting healthy eating. After hearing all the suggestions and weighing the pros and cons, Woolworths ultimately decides to cancel the 40-cent-per-crate levy. They agree to one of the alternative funding solutions, which ensures that the Jamie's Garden promotion can continue without adding financial strain on the farmers. This decision leaves both the vegetable growers and Jamie Oliver relieved and grateful. The farmers are able to focus on growing their produce and providing quality food for the community, without the added stress of increased costs. Jamie's Garden promotion goes on to become a successful campaign that educates the public about the importance of consuming fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as supporting local growers. Woolworths, Jamie Oliver, and the vegetable growers all come out of the situation with their reputations intact, and a newfound sense of collaboration, having worked together to find a common ground that benefits all. In conclusion, this story ends with a resolution where Jamie Oliver stands by his principles of promoting food education and better nutrition, while farmers are spared from the added cost of the levy. Ultimately, all parties are satisfied and the community gains a greater appreciation for the importance of consuming healthy, locally-grown produce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft.

Инцидентът е бил записан от охранителните камери на обект в съседство. Ето какво разказва Харбалиев: „Жертва бях аз, а не детето което се хвърли пред колата ми. И Детето е било принудено от близките си да се хвърли под колата ми. Щом слязох и го грабнах да го заведа в болницата, на секундата ми го измъкнаха от ръцете добре подготвените му близки с чакащата ги кола. Всичко това го има на записите в полицията. Дал съм обяснения и там са наясно за порочната схема на братята роми“, разказва бизнесменът.  „Близките на детето целят да вземат безщетение от застрахователите на стойност 50000 лева.

Three months later, David Abbott (Ruffalo), a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a 'fateful' happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth's spirit begin to 'bond', as much as that is possible, and he takes her out-of-town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has 'been there' before, and, in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 26-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl (Heder), Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves. It is revealed that one of Elizabeth's young nieces can also sense her presence. Abby thinks David is mentally disturbed and drives him out of her house. Desperate, David decides to prevent...

Please answer a question about the following article about Pharmaceutical industry: A 2009 Cochrane review concluded that thiazide antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of death (RR 0.89), stroke (RR 0.63), coronary heart disease (RR 0.84), and cardiovascular events (RR 0.70) in people with high blood pressure. In the ensuring years other classes of antihypertensive drug were developed and found wide acceptance in combination therapy, including loop diuretics (Lasix/furosemide, Hoechst Pharmaceuticals, 1963), beta blockers (ICI Pharmaceuticals, 1964) ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of new onset kidney disease [RR 0.71] and death [RR 0.84] in diabetic patients, irrespective of whether they have hypertension. What reduces the risk of new onset kidney diseases and death?","output":"In the article, it states that ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitors reduce the risk of new onset kidney disease and death in diabetic patients, irrespective of whether they have hypertension. The reported risk reduction for new onset kidney disease with ACE inhibitors is 0.71 (RR - relative risk), and the risk reduction for death is 0.84 (RR). ACE inhibitors are a class of drugs that work by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure. By inhibiting this conversion, ACE inhibitors lead to a decrease in blood pressure, which can be beneficial in managing hypertension. It is important to note that the article also mentions the use of other antihypertensive drug classes, such as thiazide antihypertensive drugs, loop diuretics, beta blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers, in combination therapy for the management of high blood pressure. These drug classes have been developed over the years and have found wide acceptance in treating hypertensive patients. They also contribute to the reduction of various cardiovascular risks, such as the risk of death, stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular events, as highlighted in the 2009 Cochrane review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who found the key to Bernie's safe deposit box? is inside the article: Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox., can you guess it ?

Flash to the present, and chips called \\"Zoe\\" are inserted into the brain at birth and record a person's entire life; when the person dies, the video is edited and shown at the funeral. Video editor (\\"cutter\\") Alan Hakman edits the recordings of people's lives according to the wishes of the subject's family, interviewing the person's family members to get an idea of what to look for in the recordings. Of course, in the case of some unscrupulous people, the bad parts are left out, but the entire recording of a person's life is therefore subject to scrutiny. So, in some cases, Hakman was knowingly burying the bad and highlighting the good. As a result, Alan is turned into a cold megalomaniac, but things change when he stumbles across a subject's memory of his friend, who he thought was dead. In searching for a record of his friend's Zoe chip, he finds none, as only 20% of all people have the implants. What he does find is a record of his own implant, of which he was unaware. He goes about accessing the memory, which shows that Alan's friend was still breathing, and the \\"blood\\" Alan thought he remembered stepping in as he was leaving the building turned out to be paint. Meantime, the Zoe chip of his subject is destroyed during a confrontation in his office. Confronted by activists who want his subject's life opened to all, Alan attempts to flee because his memory chip recorded what he saw of the subject's life, but is shot and killed by the activist, who justifies his actions, hence Alan was not killed in vain.

Argentina allows personal consumption of marijuana, and a federal judge had issued a stay against prosecuting the unnamed woman, who swore she used the marijuana solely for herself, the government's Judicial Information Center said last week. But the public prosecutor's office appealed the ruling, and a federal appeals court overturned the previous decision because the woman lives with her two sons and a grandchild. She could not prove the marijuana was solely for personal consumption, the three-page appeals court ruling said. Argentina's Supreme Court ruled in August it is unconstitutional to punish an adult for private use of marijuana -- as long as the use doesn't harm anyone else. The unanimous ruling made Argentina the second Latin American country within a one-week span last year to allow personal use of a formerly illegal drug. Mexico also enacted a law in August that decriminalized possession of small quantities of most drugs, including marijuana, heroin, cocaine and LSD. Earlier last year, a Brazilian appeals court ruled possession of drugs for personal use is not illegal.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is another word for changes to the bacteria?\\" is in \\"Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\".

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which island contributed more to an increase in carbon dioxide levels? A:","output":"Hill Island Based on the information provided in the paragraph above, Hill Island utilized fossil fuels and released a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is a major source of human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. This is due to the fact that these fuels contain high amounts of carbon, which, when burned, combine with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide. This greenhouse gas is widely recognized as one of the primary culprits behind global warming and climate change. On the other hand, Coral Island is described as being very protective of the air and the ocean. Although the specific actions the island takes are not mentioned, it is implied that Coral Island has a lower carbon footprint and is likely pursuing environmentally-friendly practices to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. This could include the use of sustainable energy sources, conservation of resources, and adherence to eco-friendly policies that protect the environment. In conclusion, of the two islands, Hill Island has contributed more to an increase in carbon dioxide levels due to its reliance on fossil fuels and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The growth of plants like mosses and lichens on bare rock, with their roots penetrating and forcing their way through rocks, causing them to split apart. These processes are not related to the presence or need for satellites in any manner. Satellites, typically found in Earth's orbit, are beneficial for various purposes such as communication, navigation, weather monitoring, and surveillance. However, they do not directly or indirectly interact with the physical erosion processes occurring on the Earth's surface. Thus, the supposed perturbation of having less satellites needed falls under the category of \\"not impacting any step of the process\\" when it comes to rock erosion.

Read this and answer the question Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

Kohn: Massive amounts of money and lobbying overturns the will of Americans on issues.","output":"Title: U.S. Supreme Court's Ruling on Election Donations: A Blow to Democracy? Introduction In a recent landmark decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the cap on the aggregate amount of election donations is unconstitutional. The ruling has sparked a heated debate, as critics argue that it benefits those with deep pockets and undermines the democratic integrity of the United States. In particular, commentator Sally Kohn expresses her concerns over the consequences of the new ruling, stating that it would further exacerbate the issues of influence-peddling in American politics. Money Talks: The Disproportionate Influence of Wealthy Donors According to Sally Kohn, the Supreme Court's decision allows the wealthiest individuals and groups an unfair advantage in influencing the political landscape. With the removal of donation caps, those with more resources can now buy a larger share of political influence through campaign contributions. This shift in the political playing field creates a clear disparity in the ability of individuals and organizations to have their interests represented in the political process. Furthermore, Kohn points out that money can grant disproportionate access to political representatives and their staff. With more resources at their disposal, wealthy donors can employ lobbyists and organize fundraisers to put forward their interests and gain valuable face time with politicians. This situation harms democracy, as legislators may become more responsive to the demands of their affluent supporters, potentially overshadowing the needs and wishes of average citizens. Overturning the Will of Americans: Campaign Finance and Policy Outcomes One of Kohn's most significant concerns is how unlimited amounts of money can potentially corrupt the democratic process and lead to outcomes that might not reflect the will of the majority of Americans. For example, powerful lobbying groups and individuals could leverage their financial clout to pressure legislators to adopt policies that may not have public support or are detrimental to the public interest. The ever-increasing influence of money in elections skews policy outcomes and erodes public trust in the democratic process. This disparity can breed cynicism and alienation among voters, who may come to believe that their voice does not matter when competing with wealthy donors for the attention and support of elected officials. The Need for Campaign Finance Reform In light of the Supreme Court's decision, campaign finance reform becomes even more crucial in order to safeguard American democracy. Possible solutions might include the introduction of public financing for political campaigns and stricter disclosure requirements for donors and lobbyists. Moreover, re-establishing caps on contributions or exploring a system of small-dollar matching funds could help level the playing field and include more voices in the political process. In a democracy, everyone's voice should carry equal weight, regardless of their financial resources. It is essential to consider these concerns and how the current ruling may perpetuate the unequal influence of money in politics. The debate over campaign finance reform will need to address these issues and strive to create a more equitable and transparent political system. Conclusion The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on election donations has far-reaching implications for the health and future of American democracy. Sally Kohn's insights on the potential dangers of this decision should not be taken lightly. It is now more important than ever to engage in a thoughtful discussion about the role of money in politics and whether the current system truly upholds the democratic principles which the United States was founded upon. To protect the integrity of American democracy and ensure that the will of the people is upheld, policymakers must take active steps to address the concerns raised by this ruling and work to implement meaningful campaign finance reform."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A well-designed site not only engages users but also enhances their overall experience. In this article, we will discuss five design tips that can transform any website into an eye-catching and user-friendly platform. These tips include embracing simplicity, maintaining a consistent theme, utilizing white space, and employing short paragraphs. 1. Embrace Simplicity: One of the core principles of effective web design is keeping it simple. An overcrowded and complex website can be overwhelming for users, whereas a clean and straightforward design will make navigation easier and provide a better user experience. To achieve this, limit the number of elements on each page and avoid excessive use of animations and flashy graphics. This minimalistic approach in site design will not only improve the overall aesthetics but also ensures faster load times and increased accessibility for all users. 2. Maintain a Consistent Theme: A consistent theme plays a pivotal role in enhancing any website's visual appeal. It includes maintaining consistent color schemes, fonts, and design elements across all pages. This uniformity not only creates a professional appearance but also aids in brand recognition. A consistent theme makes it easier for users to navigate the site, as they can easily predict the placement of different elements, ensuring a seamless browsing experience. 3. Utilize White Space: White space, also referred to as negative space, is the empty space that surrounds the site's content and design elements. Embracing white space plays a significant role in creating an aesthetically pleasing website. It serves to declutter the design, visually separate different sections, and improve readability. White space allows the user's eyes to rest, preventing visual fatigue and reducing the chances of users abandoning the site due to an overwhelming design. 4. Employ Short Paragraphs: Nobody enjoys reading large blocks of text, especially on a digital platform. To enhance user experience and ensure that your content is easily digestible, opt for short paragraphs. Breaking down content into smaller segments enables users to quickly scan through the information and find what they are looking for. In addition, using bullet points, subheadings, and numbered lists can further improve the readability and organization of your web content. Conclusion: Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website is essential in today's competitive digital environment. By embracing simplicity, maintaining a consistent theme, utilizing white space, and employing short paragraphs, you can design a website that captivates users, promotes engagement, and ultimately boosts conversions. Keep these design tips in mind and witness your site transform into a pleasing platform that resonates with your audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.

The selfish Aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat that Lilja and her mother had lived in, while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment. A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilja. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for cash, but Lilja does not join her. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and implicates Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  and the situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  Answer the following question: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move faster? The answer to this question is:","output":"Both Group Jones and Group George experienced an increase in the speed of air molecules inside their cans as they heated the soup over the campfires. However, it is important to note that the consequences of the heated air molecules were different for the two groups due to their methods of heating the cans. As mentioned in the background information, the kinetic-molecular theory explains that when the air inside a container is heated, the molecules gain more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and collide with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. In both cases, since they used campfires to heat the cans of soup, the air molecules inside the cans experienced an increase in their kinetic energy. The difference between Group Jones and Group George is the way they heated the cans. Group Jones did not vent the cans before heating them, leading to an increase in pressure inside the cans as the air molecules moved faster and collided more frequently with the walls, as well as the boiling of the soup, which generated even more gas and pressure. This caused the cans to explode due to the pressure exceeding the strength of the can. On the other hand, Group George vented their cans before heating them. By doing so, they allowed the pressure inside the cans to be released as the air molecules gained kinetic energy and gas formed due to boiling. As a result, the cans did not explode in Group George's case. In summary, the air molecules inside both groups' cans moved faster due to the heat from the campfires. However, Group George was able to manage the pressure inside the cans by venting them, preventing explosions, while Group Jones experienced explosions due to not venting the cans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Cervical mucus that is thin may be more favorable to the male Y-chromosome. Guaifenesin, which is generally found in cough syrups, can also help thin cervical mucus. Taking guaifenesin during ovulation may increase your chances of having a baby boy.  Talk to your doctor before taking guaifenesin to ensure it is safe for you to use. Check the labeling to ensure that the product only has guaifenesin and not additional ingredients for the symptoms of a cold. Reducing the acidity in a woman’s cervical fluid can also increase the chances of conceiving a baby boy. Eat alkaline foods such as spinach or beets in the weeks prior to ovulation to optimize your chances of having a boy. Examples of high-alkaline foods include:  Buttermilk Coconut, olive, flax, and sesame oils Avocado Banana Sour cherries Figs Lima and soybeans Almonds and almond butter Beets Yams Asparagus Leafy greens Broccoli There is some evidence that women who consume more potassium and sodium may be more likely to conceive boys. Increase your potassium and sodium intakes within reason in the weeks before ovulation. Foods that provide potassium and sodium include:  Bananas Breakfast cereal Canned beans  Leafy greens Oranges and grapefruits Sweet potatoes and winter squash Plain yogurt Cheese Caffeine may make Y-chromosome sperm more active. Have your significant other drink a cup of coffee or soda before you have sex. This may increase your chances of conceiving a boy. Weight loss may increase your risk of having a girl. Instead of doing intense cardio, reach for some weights. This can increase your muscle mass and add healthy weight, both of which may help you conceive a baby boy. Ask your doctor if you are healthy enough to lift weights. Then, meet with a certified fitness trainer to develop the best strength-training program to build muscle. Tight underwear or pants may affect your partner’s sperm production because they keep the scrotum too warm. Having your partner wear boxer shorts and looser pants may increase your chances of conceiving a boy.","output":"This article suggests that thin cervical mucus may be more favorable for the male Y-chromosome, which is necessary for conceiving a baby boy. Guaifenesin, commonly found in cough syrups, can help thin the cervical mucus. Taking guaifenesin during ovulation could potentially increase the chances of having a baby boy. However, it's essential to consult with a doctor before using guaifenesin for this purpose and ensure that the product contains only guaifenesin and no additional cold-fighting ingredients. Another factor that may improve the likelihood of conceiving a boy is reducing the acidity in a woman's cervical fluid. This can be achieved by consuming alkaline foods such as spinach and beets in the weeks leading up to ovulation. Examples of high-alkaline foods include buttermilk, coconut, olive, flax, sesame oils, avocado, banana, sour cherries, figs, lima and soybeans, almonds, almond butter, beets, yams, asparagus, leafy greens, and broccoli. Some evidence suggests that women who consume more potassium and sodium are more likely to conceive boys. To increase potassium and sodium intake within reasonable limits before ovulation, consider eating foods like bananas, breakfast cereal, canned beans, leafy greens, oranges, grapefruits, sweet potatoes, winter squash, plain yogurt, and cheese. Caffeine may make Y-chromosome sperm more active, so having your partner drink a cup of coffee or soda before sex may increase your chances of having a boy. In terms of physical fitness, weight loss might increase the risk of having a girl; thus, focusing on strength training to build muscle and add healthy weight might help with conceiving a boy. It is crucial to consult a doctor to ensure you are healthy enough for strength training and work with a certified fitness trainer to develop an appropriate program. Lastly, tight underwear or pants could negatively impact your partner's sperm production by keeping the scrotum too warm.

Are the documentaries Welcome to Durham, USA and The Agronomist both about Durham, North Carolina? The answer is:","output":"No, the documentaries Welcome to Durham, USA and The Agronomist are not both about Durham, North Carolina. These two documentaries focus on different subjects and locations. Welcome to Durham, USA is a documentary that showcases the city of Durham, North Carolina, and the people, culture, and history of this region. This documentary aims to provide an in-depth look at the social, economic, and political issues that have shaped the city and its diverse communities. It highlights the challenges and triumphs of Durham's residents as they navigate their lives in a city undergoing tremendous growth and development. The filmmaker focuses on various aspects of Durham, including its revitalization efforts, the significance of its historically black colleges and universities, and its eclectic mix of food, art, and entertainment scenes. In short, Welcome to Durham, USA is a comprehensive exploration of the city of Durham, North Carolina, and its unique identity and character. On the other hand, The Agronomist is a documentary film that tells the story of Jean Dominique, a Haitian radio journalist and human rights activist. This documentary is set in Haiti, which is located in the Caribbean and is geographically distant from Durham, North Carolina. Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Jonathan Demme, The Agronomist focuses on Dominique's life, his role as the owner and operator of Haiti's Radio Haiti Inter, and his fight for the freedom of expression in a country marred by political turmoil, dictatorship, and violence. Dominique used his radio platform to voice his concerns about the country's oppressive regimes and expose the injustices faced by the Haitian people. Ultimately, his activism made him a target of the authorities, leading to his assassination in 2000. The documentary thus serves as an ode to Dominique's unyielding dedication to speaking truth to power and inspires viewers to reflect on the importance of journalism and activism in upholding democratic values. In conclusion, while both Welcome to Durham, USA and The Agronomist are documentaries, they have distinct focal points and settings. Welcome to Durham, USA examines the city of Durham, North Carolina, and its multifaceted and dynamic community, while The Agronomist tells the story of a Haitian radio journalist and activist who fought for free speech and human rights amidst political strife and adversity. Consequently, these two documentaries offer unique perspectives on their respective subjects and cannot be accurately described as both being about Durham, North Carolina."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What mandate contained the Balfour Declaration Context: In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.

Article: Carl Vinson strike group seen near Indonesia, not the Korean peninsula      YOKOSUKA NAVAL BASE, Japan — If the USS Carl Vinson strike group is heading to the Korean peninsula, it is taking its time.      More than a week after reports first emerged that the aircraft carrier and its accompanying ships were headed toward the peninsula amid fears North Korea may conduct another nuclear test, Navy photos from Saturday show Vinson operating nearly 3,500 miles away, off Indonesia.      Defense News first reported the existence of the photos, which are freely available on the official Navy.mil website.      If traveling at maximum speed, which the Navy lists at “34.5+ mph,” it would take the carrier, two destroyers and a cruiser roughly four to five days to reach the peninsula from Indonesia’s Sunda Strait.      Submarines also regularly provide undersea cover for carrier strike groups.      U.S. Pacific Command officials in Hawaii on Monday referred questions about the strike group to Pacific Fleet, which said it does not discuss details of ship movements.      “The Carl Vinson Strike Group cancelled a previously planned port visit to Australia and is continuing on track for all assigned missions in the Western Pacific,” a statement said.      Thus far, reports on Vinson’s impending arrival in waters near South Korea have come from White House and other Washington officials. The Navy and Pacific Command haven’t dissuaded any of those reports, but never explicitly confirmed Korea as its destination or discussed a timeline.      PACOM directed the Vinson strike group “to sail north and report on station in the Western Pacific Ocean after departing Singapore on April 8 … rather than executing previously planned port visits to Australia,” according to its initial statement on the move.      Soon afterward, PACOM spokesman Cmdr. Dave Benham said the strike group was ordered north “as a prudent measure to maintain readiness and presence.      “Third Fleet ships operate forward with a purpose: to safeguard U.S. interests in the Western Pacific.,” Benham said. The number one threat in the region continues to be North Korea, due to its reckless, irresponsible, and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.”      In an interview with President Donald Trump on Fox Business News last week, host Maria Bartiromo asked, “You redirected Navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula. What are we doing right now in terms of North Korea?      “You never know do you? You never know,” Trump responded.      After declining to discuss military movements initially, Trump then said that, “We are sending an armada. Very powerful.”      “We have submarines. Very powerful; far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you,” he added.      A Reuters reporter covering the Pentagon first reported April 9 that the Vinson strike group was headed toward the Korean peninsula, citing an unnamed U.S. official.      “We feel the increased presence is necessary,” the official told Reuters, citing North Korea’s worrisome behavior.      The Vinson group includes the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its embarked air wing, the destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer and USS Michael Murphy, and the cruiser USS Lake Champlain.      Trump has stated that all options, including military action, are possible as North Korea continues to develop its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program. The communist state has conducted two nuclear tests and test-fired nearly 30 missiles since last year.      A North Korean missile exploded seconds after launch Sunday, according to U.S. officials. The failure came as Vice President Mike Pence arrived in the South for talks.      Stars and Stripes reporter Wyatt Olson contributed to this report.      slavin.erik@stripes.com      Twitter:@eslavin_stripes ||||| (CNN) The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its strike group will arrive off the Korean Peninsula at the end of April, multiple US defense officials tell CNN.      The carrier and its escorts left Singapore on April 8, according to a statement from the Navy's Pacific Fleet. They were ordered to head north to the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korean provocations, defense officials told CNN at the time.

Meyer and USS Michael Murphy and the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain would participate in naval exercises with the Australian navy south of Singapore before heading to Korea.      But the announcement that the Vinson had been dispatched to Korea increased tensions with Pyongyang, with its official Korean Central News Agency calling the carrier's deployment \\"nothing but a reckless action of aggression to aggravate the tensions in the region.\\"      US President Donald Trump added to the tension early last week by telling Fox Business News he was sending \\"an armada\\" of powerful warships and submarines to waters off Korea.      Read More ||||| WASHINGTON — For more than a week, media reports in the U.S. and around Asia routinely have mentioned the approach of the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson's carrier strike group, seemingly implying an attack on North Korea could be imminent. But a week after the U.S. announced the carrier and its escorts would leave Singapore, forego port calls in Australia and instead return to Korean waters, the carrier and its group had yet to head north.            Rather, the ships were actually operating several hundred miles south of Singapore, taking part in scheduled exercises with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean.            On Saturday — according to photographs released by the U.S. Navy — the carrier passed north through the Sunda Strait, the passage between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. It's about 3,500 miles from Korea.            U.S. Navy officials in Pearl Harbor and Washington declined to comment on the ship's movements, other than to confirm the April 15 movement through the Sunda Strait. Off the record, several officials expressed wonderment at the persistent reports that the Vinson was already nearing Korea. \\"We've made no such statement,\\" said one official.            Those same officials did not push back on reports that the Vinson would return to Korean waters, where the strike group operated for much of March as part of the annual U.S.-Korean Foal Eagle exercises. While declining to confirm a specific date, they did not dispute speculative media reports from South Korea that the strike group could be in the region by April 25 or so.            Officials did, however, flatly deny reports that three U.S. carrier strike groups were being directed to mass off the Korean peninsula in a few weeks.            Speculation has been rising that the Ronald Reagan and Nimitz strike groups could join with the Vinson. The Japan-based carrier Reagan, however, is in a maintenance period at Yokosuka scheduled to complete in May. The Bremerton, Washington-based Nimitz and her strike group is off Southern California, nearing the completion of its major pre-deployment exercise. The ship is scheduled to deploy this spring to relieve the Vinson in the Western Pacific.            The Vinson's return to Korea was ordered on April 8 by Adm. Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command. On April 11, Defense Secretary James Mattis – having just met with Harris in Washington – noted that no specific incident prompted the order to curtail the exercise program and head north.            \\"She's stationed there in the western Pacific for a reason,\\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. \\"She operates freely up and down the Pacific, and she's just on her way up there because that's where we thought it was most prudent to have her at this time. There's not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we're sending her up there.\\"       |||||Summary:","output":"The Carl Vinson strike group was seen off Indonesia, rather than near the Korean peninsula. Reports that the US would deploy the aircraft carriers and accompanying ships near North Korea emerged last week but Navy photos showed that the group was actually 3,500 miles away.

Playing together is a way for animals to bond, establish hierarchy, and develop social skills. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

He was formerly the executive editor of Bloomberg News, directing coverage of the Washington bureau.      Rising frustration with Washington and conservative electoral victories across much of the U.S. are feeding a movement in favor of something America hasn't done in 227 years: Hold a convention to rewrite the Constitution.      Although it's still not likely to be successful, the effort is more serious than before: Already, more than two dozen states have called for a convention. There are two ways to change or amend the founding document. The usual method is for an adjustment to win approval from two-thirds of the Congress and then be ratified by three-quarters of the states. There have been 27 amendments adopted this way.      The second procedure is separate from Congress. It requires two-thirds of the states, or 34, to call for a convention. The framers thought this was necessary because Congress wouldn't be likely to advance any amendments that curtailed its powers. But this recourse never has been used.      Two states, California and Vermont, have called for a convention to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision that permits huge amounts of unregulated money into federal campaigns. Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, wants a convention to adopt sweeping changes, including a single six-year presidential term and concomitant House and Senate terms, to create more of a parliamentary system. Petitions to adopt term limits for members of Congress have circulated for years.      But much of the current impetus comes from fervent fiscal conservatives. This includes calls for an amendment requiring a balanced budget and other restraints on the federal government's spending and taxation powers.      A constitutional convention is a rallying cry for right-wing talk-radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin; the idea has been endorsed by Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Oklahoma's Tom Coburn, both conservative Republicans. An influential backer is the American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, an organization of conservative state legislators and private sector lobbyists that advocates for corporate interests.      However, many constitutional scholars believe that limits cannot be placed on a convention; if one were convened, anything could be up for consideration. A convention \\"can propose what they think is appropriate,\\" says Michael S. Paulsen, a professor at the University of St. Thomas law school in Minneapolis who is an expert on the issue. \\"There is no good theory under which the convention can be 'limited' to specific topics -- far less to a specific proposed \`text.'\\"      Accordingly, say experts such as Walter E. Dellinger, a former U.S. solicitor general and a constitutional scholar, no limits can be imposed on calls for a convention. That's why he believes the current petitions from states, even if they reach the two-thirds mark, are invalid.      \\"Thirty-four times zero is still zero,\\" he says.      If, however, the backlash against Washington intensifies, the Republican-led Congress stalls, these imperfections are corrected and a convention were held, Congress would play a relatively minor role. It might decide how the size of different delegations should be determined. After the federal lawmakers \\"specify the time and place for kicking it off,\\" Paulsen says, \\"they then have to get out of the way.\\"      Although it's chiefly the political right driving this proposal, there are more than a few staunch conservatives who say it's a bad idea. Foremost is U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the longtime leader of the court's conservative bloc, who observed this summer: \\"Whoa! Who knows what would come out it?\\"      Some proponents argue that a check on any convention deliberations would be that three-quarters of the states then have to ratify any decisions, so radical stuff such as changing the First Amendment wouldn't fly. \\"That is a huge hurdle,\\" Paulsen says.      Yet other observers such as Dellinger worry about the possibility of a run-away process that could rattle both the left and right. They doubt that modern-day James Madisons or Alexander Hamiltons would be in attendance to temper the proceedings.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)      A dangerous proposal is circulating in states across the country that could widen political divisions and jeopardize cherished rights and freedoms. The push is coming primarily from well-organized, arch-conservative groups seeking to capitalize on the decline in public trust in government to limit the federal government’s role and spending powers. And the method they prefer is a constitutional convention — the first since the 1787 conclave that produced the U.S. Constitution.      Under the Constitution, if two-thirds of state legislatures call for a convention to amend it, one must be convened. Some of those pushing for a convention say that 24 of the needed 34 legislatures have approved such resolutions. Advocates of a convention have targeted more than a dozen other states and are developing lobbying campaigns to push for such resolutions there.      The implications are enormous. At stake, potentially, are the freedoms we take for granted under the Bill of Rights; the powers of the president, Congress and the courts; and the policies the government can or cannot pursue. Conventioneers could alter absolutely anything about the way the United States is governed. Some say they want to terminate all federal taxes and to require super-majorities in the House and the Senate to put any new taxes in their place. Others want to bar the government from carrying out a number of its functions, for example by constraining its ability to regulate interstate commerce. Whatever changes a convention approved would be enshrined in the Constitution if three-fourths of the states ratified them.      Yet the processes for impaneling the convention, selecting the delegates, setting the convention’s voting rules, and determining what issues the convention would consider and how much of the Constitution it would seek to rewrite are a mystery. That means that under a convention, anything goes. There are no rules, guideposts or procedures in any of these areas.      The Constitution has been amended 27 times since 1791, in every case by the other amendment process allowed by our nation’s charter: two-thirds of the Senate and the House approve an amendment and three-quarters of state legislatures then ratify it. This process has served us well. The 27th amendment, which prohibits members of Congress from raising their salary until the current term ends, took effect in 1992.      By contrast, there has not been a constitutional convention since the first one, and for good reason. As constitutional experts from the late Chief Justice Warren Burger to Justice Antonin Scalia to Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe have warned, a constitutional convention would place the nation in uncharted territory, with very serious risks for our political system. Convening a convention, as Tribe put it, would be “putting the whole Constitution up for grabs.” And although I don’t often agree with Scalia, he hit the nail on the head when he said recently: “I certainly would not want a constitutional convention. Whoa! Who knows what would come out of it?”      The Constitution sets no rules for how a constitutional convention would work. What standards determine whether 34 states have called for a convention? Do all resolutions that state legislatures have ever passed count — even if they called for conventions on very different topics, or were passed 50 or 100 years ago, or were later rescinded, as some have been? Oklahoma, for instance, passed a resolution in 1976 calling for a convention but rescinded it in 2009, citing concerns about throwing the Constitution wide open to unknown changes; some proponents argue that Oklahoma should still count anyway. Can that be right? The Constitution is silent on all of these issues.      That’s just the start. If a convention were called, how many delegates would each state get, and how would they be selected? How long could the convention last? The Constitution provides no guidance on those questions either.      Constitutional law experts generally agree that it would be up to Congress to decide these issues. The president has no role, and with no legal guideposts, the courts probably would decline to intervene. Given the high stakes involved, these issues could generate intense partisan division and acrimony, and Congress could make decisions on them on a highly partisan basis.      Suppose, for example, that Congress ruled that every state would have two votes in the convention and the convention could approve amendments by simple majority vote. In that case, the 26 least populous states, with less than 18 percent of the nation’s population, could approve broad changes in our Constitution and send them to the states for ratification.      Some convention proponents, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, blithely promise that Congress could limit the scope of the amendments that a convention could consider. But many prominent constitutional law experts disagree. The Constitution provides no authority above that of a constitutional convention itself; accordingly, the courts probably would decline to intervene here, as well, to limit a convention’s scope. As Burger wrote, “[T]here is no way to effectively limit or muzzle the actions of a Constitutional Convention. The Convention could make its own rules and set its own agenda. Congress might try to limit the convention to one amendment or one issue, but there is no way to assure that the Convention would obey.”      Similarly, as the late Justice Arthur Goldberg cautioned, “There is no enforceable mechanism to prevent a convention from reporting out wholesale changes to our Constitution and Bill of Rights.” Proponents are already calling for a convention to consider such actions (in addition to ending all current taxes) as setting term limits for Congress and the Supreme Court, imposing sharp limits on presidential authority, and scaling back the General Welfare and Commerce clauses of the Constitution.      Moreover, given the potential to write major policy changes into the Constitution where they would be almost impossible to remove, powerful, well-funded interest groups probably would spend vast sums to influence the selection of delegates and then the convention itself. There are no federal or state limits on what powerful interests and wealthy individuals could spend to influence convention delegates. Burger expressed concern that a “Constitutional Convention today would be a free-for-all for special interest groups.”      One can readily imagine a convention leading to extensive “log-rolling,” where delegates backed certain changes to the Constitution in return for others’ support for their own preferred changes. A sprawling package of alterations could emerge, designed to build support for the overall package by including the favored fixes of single-issue constituencies.      Our country faces enough problems and division. We don’t need to add to them and inflame an already toxic political environment by placing at risk the constitutional structure that has served us well for more than two centuries — and heading into dangerous, unknown territory by convening a convention to rework the Constitution. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"There is a rising movement in the United States to hold a convention to rewrite the Constitution, something that hasn't been done in 227 years.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946?  On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when  Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent...

Q:Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

However, this statement is vague and does not provide any further information on how one should go about learning the different types of ballet or why this is important in achieving proper posture. It would be more helpful to include a brief overview of the major types of ballet, and explain how posture requirements might vary between them. 2. \\"Choose the hand of your choice.\\" The instruction to choose a hand might be interpreted as ambiguous, as it does not specify the purpose for choosing this hand or provide context on how this decision affects the subsequent steps. 3. \\"With the palm of that hand facing the floor, place it in the space beneath the middle of your back, but above your tailbone.\\" This instruction might be helpful in terms of physical guidance on achieving proper posture. Placing a hand at the designated location might reinforce a person's awareness of their lower back position and encourage them to maintain an aligned posture. However, it is important to note that achieving correct posture in ballet involves much more than just the lower back positioning. Attention should also be given to the alignment of the head, shoulders, hips, knees, and feet.  In conclusion, while the instructions given offer some assistance for achieving correct posture, they are not comprehensive or detailed enough to be considered truly helpful.

A U.S. Coast Guard chopper responding to a possibly distressed boater off the South Carolina coast was forced to make an emergency landing when the pilot was temporarily blinded by a laser, the service said. The scare on Wednesday near Garden City Beach was the third time in as many weeks that Coast Guard pilots in that area, called the Grand Strand, have reported being disabled by sharp laser light. \\"We've been very fortunate that the green laser incidents haven't yet resulted in tragedy,\\" Coast Guard Cmdr. Gregory Fuller of Air Station Savannah said in a statement. In the latest incident, the chopper responded to reports of orange flares offshore. Following the emergency landing, another crew took over and continued the search. No distressed boater or any evidence of flares were found, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard is working with police to try to find out who is responsible. The pilot in this case was grounded for 24 hours before being cleared to fly again. It is unclear what type of laser might have been used in this case. But reports by commercial and private pilots of laser incidents nationally have jumped in recent years as hand-held technology has become readily available and easily used. Aviation safety officials and law enforcement are trying to curb the activity and are stepping up prosecutions. Phony Mayday calls vexing Coast Guard. Coast Guard officials have deemed the Grand Strand area of the South Carolina coast where pilots have reported lasers as very high risk, and now require crews to consider the possibility of a laser scenario before responding to a distress call. \\"Every time we send our aircrews to the Grand Strand, we're telling them to fly into the equivalent of a storm, where it's almost guaranteed they'll be hit,\\" Fuller said. \\"We're simply asking the public to stop putting Coast Guard men and women in senseless and unnecessary danger.\\" It is a problem becoming all too frequent for pilots. The number of reported laser incidents involving aircraft in the United States has risen 26% from 2,836 in 2010 to 3,592 in 2011. It has more than doubled since 2009. \\"Shining a laser at an airplane is not a laughing matter. It's dangerous for both pilots and passengers, and we will not tolerate it,\\" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in May. FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta has said federal authorities will \\"aggressively\\" prosecute violators under a new law that makes laser targeting a federal crime, and will not treat incidents with warning notices or counseling. The FAA and the Justice Department are pushing for stiffer penalties against those responsible for targeting aircraft. Since June last year, the FAA has started enforcement action against 28 people charged with aiming a laser device at an aircraft and has opened \\"dozens of additional cases\\" for investigation, the agency said. Dealing with these incidents on top of an increase in false mayday calls have frustrated Coast Guard officials. \\"The biggest downfall is that their night vision is ruined, and they're flying blind. It's dangerous for the pilots and the crew. Their lives and the lives of the crew are at risk,\\" Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jamie Fredrick told CNN. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.

This article: Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \\"Lucky You\\". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow.

What most naturally follows? How to apply perfume  Find your perfect perfume.  Do not just wear something because it is a designer perfume. Make sure you absolutely love the perfume's top notes and bottom notes.","output":"After finding your perfect perfume, focusing on the top and bottom notes, it is essential to learn how to apply the perfume correctly to make the most out of it. The following steps will guide you through the process of applying perfume in the best way possible: 1. Choose the right time – To get the maximum potential of your perfume, it is best to apply it right after a shower or bath on clean and hydrated skin. Your skin's pores will be more open, enabling the perfume to absorb better, creating a longer-lasting scent. 2. Apply a fragrance-free moisturizer or body lotion – Dry skin has lesser capacity to retain the fragrance. Thus, it is ideal to use an unscented moisturizer or body lotion before applying the perfume. It will provide a smooth and moisturized skin surface that will help the perfume last longer. 3. Identify your pulse points – Pulse points are the areas on your body where blood vessels are closest to the skin. These spots produce heat, which helps the fragrance to diffuse and emit scent. Common pulse points include your wrists, the inside of your elbows, the base of your throat, behind the earlobes, and behind your knees. 4. Spray the perfume – Hold the perfume bottle at a distance of about 15-20 cm (6-8 inches) from your body. Target one or two pulse points at a time. Avoid rubbing your skin after applying the perfume, as it can break down the fragrance structure and alter its scent. 5. Layer your scents – To make your perfume last even longer and enhance its depth, consider layering the fragrance. Many perfume brands offer matching body washes, body lotions, and other scented accessories that work well together. 6. Test the fragrance on your skin – It is important to understand that body chemistry can affect how a perfume smells on you. Therefore, always test the scent on your skin just by spraying a small amount and waiting for around 30 minutes to see how it evolves. This step will help you find the perfect scent that works best with your natural body odor. 7. Apply a moderate amount – Overdoing the perfume application can be overwhelming for you and those around you. Therefore, apply a moderate amount, and remember that you can always reapply the scent later in the day if needed. 8. Reapply when necessary – Throughout your day, scents can fade away. Reapply the perfume on your pulse points when required but be mindful not to overdo it. Keep in mind, though, the scent might not be as strong to you as it was earlier in the day, but others may still notice it. This phenomenon is known as nose fatigue. 9. Store your perfume correctly – To maintain the quality and longevity of your perfume, store it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and temperature fluctuations. Keep it in its original packaging, if possible, to protect it from light and heat. By incorporating these steps into your perfume application routine, you can make sure that your chosen fragrance radiates confidently throughout the day, enhancing your presence and making you feel great."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I found SanTan Brewing back in July and have pretty much become a regular there.  Okay, well, my buddy Bill is Norm and I'm Cliff at Cheers - except that people actually like me.  I mainly go there for the uber-friendly service.   James at the bar always has a warm handshake, a bad joke, and smile.  The waitstaff is just as friendly, whether it's Kate, Shanna, Carlos, Jordan, Kim or just about anyone else.  We've always been seated promptly, and a manager has virtually always come by the table (or even the bar) to check on things.  Service was slow at the Octoberfest, but that was mainly because they expected about 500, and 2000 people showed up.  But being a regular has its benefits - Shanna brought us pizza so we didn't have wait in a two-hour line for the charred 8 brats at the 'Fest!  The food does vary a bit.  The pretzels, SanTan Slingers, pizzas, burgers, fries and soups are great.  I'm not crazy about the grilled cheese, brats or tacos, though.  The wings at Zipps are better, but that's the ONLY thing about Zipps that beats SanTan!  I like the beer quite a lot.  I just switched to the Gordo Stout for the winter, though normally I drink the Sunspot Gold.  The IPA is good, though I don't like it quite as well as either IPA at Four Peaks.  I'm not a red beer guy, so I can't really comment on those. Most people seem to like the ginger-laced Winter Warmer - my friend Justin really enjoyed his last night - but I'm not really into malty beers.  They have a fun trivia night on Thursdays.  Even if you don't play, it's a great way to meet new people.  There are usually bands on the weekends, though the music is definitely geared to people in their thirties and up.  That's actually part of the reason SanTan appeals to me: it's mostly grown-ups there to enjoy the beer and relax, and not so many young kids doing shots and getting hammered.  I think this place is way, way better than the chains like Rock Bottom or Gordon Biersch.  The beer isn't quite at the Four Peaks level yet, but the service is MUCH friendlier and the atmosphere much more adult.  Give it a try if you're in Chandler.

Q: Q: What is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell?   A: A:","output":"The process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell is called phagocytosis. Here are the step-by-step processes and justifications for each step: 1. Detection: In the first step, the cell detects the presence of a large particle or foreign substance in its vicinity. This could be a bacterium, dead or damaged cells, or other particles that need to be cleared. This is crucial because the cell needs to identify when something needs to be engulfed or removed for proper functioning and maintaining overall health of the organism. 2. Receptor binding: The cell surface has specialized receptors that can recognize and bind with the large particle. These receptors may be specific to certain types of particles or may be more generalized for a variety of targets. The binding is essential for signaling to the cell what type of particle it is dealing with and initiating the engulfment process. 3. Membrane extensions: When the receptors bind with the target particle, the cell membrane around the binding site starts forming extensions known as pseudopodia. These membranous protrusions begin to surround the particle, enabling the cell to grip it and eventually engulf it. The formation of pseudopodia is a vital step as it enables the cell to grab onto the large particle. 4. Particle engulfment: The pseudopodia continue to extend around the particle until they fuse at their tips, enclosing the particle within a newly-formed intracellular compartment called a phagosome. This is the actual engulfing of the particle by the cell, which is the primary aim of phagocytosis. 5. Phagosome maturation: Once the particle is enclosed within the phagosome, the compartment starts to mature by fusing with other vesicles and organelles, such as lysosomes or endosomes, which contain digestive enzymes and other molecules that can break down the engulfed particle. This maturation process is essential for the degradation and processing of the particle. 6. Particle degradation: The digestive enzymes and other molecules within the matured phagosome break down the engulfed particle into smaller components. This step is important for disposing of harmful substances or recycling the building blocks of the degraded particle for the cell's use. 7. Degradation product release: Once the particle has been completely degraded, the resulting products can be either recycled by the cell, stored for later use, or expelled from the cell through exocytosis, depending on the nature of the degraded components. This final step ensures that the cell gets rid of any waste or harmful substances, and retains useful materials. Phagocytosis is an essential cellular process that enables the removal of harmful particles, the recycling of cellular components, and the maintenance of overall cell health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Since the Coast Guard's marine safety program became a GPRA pilot program in fiscal year 1994, the number of direct program personnel declined and its budget was reduced by 2 percent. Hypothesis: They couldn't afford to keep as many people employed.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options:  (a). yes.  (b). it is not possible to tell.  (c). no.","output":"(a) Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The given premise states that since the Coast Guard's marine safety program became a GPRA (Government Performance and Results Act) pilot program in fiscal year 1994, the number of direct program personnel declined and its budget was reduced by 2 percent. This information implies that there was a reduction in resources available for the program. The hypothesis suggests that they couldn't afford to keep as many people employed. This is a reasonable explanation as to why the number of direct program personnel declined. The premise refers to a decrease in both the number of personnel and the budget, suggesting that there was an issue of affordability. When the budget for a program is reduced, it can lead to a need to prioritize where the funds are allocated. In many cases, personnel costs are a significant portion of a program's budget. As such, if the program needs to cut costs or make adjustments due to a reduced budget, reducing personnel is often one of the first steps taken. Additionally, when a program transitions to a new management structure or process, such as the switch to a GPRA pilot program, changes in personnel are common. This could be due to the need for the organization to re-evaluate its resource allocation and streamline its operations in light of the new requirements and priorities that the pilot program introduces. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis that the program couldn't afford to keep as many people employed, as both the decline in personnel and the budget reduction indicate a need for cost-cutting measures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? deeply concerned with morality","output":"Based on the provided statement, it is difficult to determine if the reviewer has a positive or negative opinion of the movie. The statement itself is neutral and only reveals that the reviewer has identified the movie as \\"deeply concerned with morality.\\" This could be interpreted as either a positive or negative trait depending on the individual's perspective. On one hand, the reviewer might view the movie's concern with morality as a positive aspect, as it can be seen as engaging with thought-provoking or complex themes. This is especially the case if the movie does so with nuance and sophistication. Such themes can be compelling to certain viewers and may elevate the film's quality in their eyes, as it can stimulate intellectual and emotional reflection on moral issues, encouraging the audience to question and think critically about their own beliefs and values. On the other hand, the reviewer might perceive the movie's preoccupation with morality as a negative feature if it comes across as heavy-handed, sermonizing, or didactic. In such a case, the movie might appear to force-feed its audience with messages or themes, communicating them in an overly explicit or preachy way, making for an off-putc. Some viewers might feel that such an approach can detract from the movie's entertainment value, and that the film sacrifices engaging storytelling in favor of moral pontification. Additionally, depending on the reviewer's own moral stance, they might disagree with the moral themes presented by the movie, which could lead to a negative perception. To conclusively derive the reviewer's opinion regarding the movie, it would be beneficial to have more context or additional information about what the reviewer meant by the statement. This could involve a more explicit evaluation or some anecdotal data about moments in the movie that resonated with the reviewer, for better or worse. To understand the reviewer's perspective fully, look for additional insights into whether they specifically appreciated the movie's concern with morality or found it cumbersome and as a hindrance to the movie's artistic merit."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: THE human face doesn't lie. We show sadness and happiness through our expressions. But exactly how many emotions can our face make?Scientists used to believe we had six basic facial expressions that tell others how we feel: sad, happy, surprised, fearful, angry and disgusted  . But a new study shows that our faces can do more than we think. Scientists from Ohio State University found out that humans can actually make 21 different facial expressions after studying how people move their facial muscles. The scientists took pictures of 230 volunteers making faces in response to different cues  .These cues included phrases like \\"you just got some great unexpected news\\", which produced a \\"happily surprised\\" reaction from volunteers. Other cues included \\"you smell a bad odor  \\", which caused \\"disgusted\\" faces. In total, around 5,000 pictures were taken of the volunteers. The scientists then studied similarities of these pictures using a computer expression database. _ helped them to define a facial expression. \\"That tells us that these 21 emotions are expressed in the same way by nearly everyone,\\" said DrAleix Martinez to The Daily Telegraph. For example, to express surprise, 92 percent of volunteers widened   their eyes and opened their mouth. And 99 percent raised their cheeks   and smiled to show being happy. We are not always aware of our facial expressions, which can hold clues to how we really feel. So these results may have a big impact   on medical treatment.

Movie title: 7aam Arivu Movie plot: The film depicts the life of Bodhidharma (Suriya), a master of martial arts and medical remedies, who is depicted in the film as the son of a great Tamil king of the Pallava Dynasty. He is sent to China by his guru, who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India. Initially the people in China treated him as an inferior but later when he cures a little girl from the deadly disease and fights against some people who ill treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect and worship him. He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism and the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there. Bodhidharma agrees to die and subsequently becomes a fundamental figure in Chinese history, affectionately being dubbed as \\"Damo\\". The film switches to modern-day China, where Dong Lee (Johnny Tri Nguyen) is given the task of starting a government planned biological war against India, known as Operation Red. Dong Lee arrives in Chennai starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China. Meanwhile, Subha Srinivasan (Shruti Haasan), a student of genetics researches that Bodhidharma can be brought back to life if his sample of DNA is matched with another sample of DNA which she finds in Aravind (Suriya) a descendant of Bodhidharma who is working as a circus artist nearby. Dong Lee finds out Subha's mission to revive Bodhidharma and plans to kill her first, so that the disease cannot be stopped.

Please answer the following question: Article: House buyers have three main choices: building from the ground up, moving into an old house or buying a new one. All the three are very different and should be considered carefully. Your budget will probably have the biggest effect on your choice. Comparing the three will help you make a good decision. New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection. There are those who prefer building from the ground up. Building your own house can be a very rewarding, tiring, and expensive experience. While people have many expectations of planning and building their own houses, one thing is sure: it will take a while.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Pick from: I. yes II. no","output":"I. yes The success and sustainability of Nintendo primarily relied on a combination of factors, which includes the popularity and exclusivity of its first-party games, strong hardware sales, and a loyal fanbase. One of the core strengths that propelled Nintendo through decades of competition has been their impeccable ability to create and develop iconic first-party game franchises that garnered a strong following. Some of these franchises include Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon, among others. These games have been synonymous with the brand, continuing to generate significant sales for both the company and the gaming industry as a whole. Furthermore, Nintendo's focus on creative innovation in its hardware design, whether it was the dual-screen capability of Nintendo DS, the motion controls of the Wii, or the hybrid system in the form of the Nintendo Switch, reflected its ambition to offer unique gaming experiences to consumers. This continuous evolution differentiated Nintendo from its rivals and attracted gamers seeking diverse experiences beyond the traditional console specifications. While it is true that Nintendo's consoles have typically suffered from weaker third-party support compared to its competitors, such as PlayStation and Xbox, the strong sales of its iconic first-party IPs and unique hardware capabilities were primarily responsible for carrying Nintendo through the fluctuating gaming landscape. Lastly, Nintendo's long-standing presence in the gaming industry resulted in an incredibly dedicated fanbase that grew up playing its games. These loyal consumers have often been willing to overlook the sparse third-party support and instead entrust Nintendo as a provider of high-quality, exclusive gaming experiences.

Combine facts and answer this: Are John Paddy Carstairs and Robert Hamer both film directors?","output":"Yes, John Paddy Carstairs and Robert Hamer were both prominent film directors, each known for their contributions to British cinema. Although they had different styles and worked on various genres, both directors earned recognition and respect for their film-making abilities. John Paddy Carstairs (born as Nelson Keys, 1910 – 1970) was an English film director who appeared in, wrote, and directed over 40 films during his career. He was particularly known for his comedies, which often featured light-hearted themes, wit, and slapstick humor. Carstairs successfully directed box office hits such as the long-running series \\"The Saint\\" (starring George Sanders), as well as films like \\"The Calendar\\" (1948) and \\"Up in the World\\" (1956). In addition to his directorial work, Carstairs was a very successful screenwriter. His gift for comedic timing and plot building made many of his films quite popular with both critics and audiences during the golden age of British cinema. Robert Hamer (1911 – 1963) was another prominent English film director and screenwriter who started his career as an editor before transitioning into directing. He is best known for his work at Ealing Studios, where he directed and co-wrote several of the studio's classic comedies. Hamer's most acclaimed work is the film \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" (1949), a black comedy that starred Alec Guinness in multiple roles and showcased Hamer's deft touch for blending dark humor and social satire. Hamer's other notable works include \\"Pink String and Sealing Wax\\" (1945), \\"It Always Rains on Sunday\\" (1947), and \\"The Long Memory\\" (1953). His films were marked by their stylish storytelling, sharp wit, social commentary, and innovative use of the cinematic medium. While both John Paddy Carstairs and Robert Hamer were both successful film directors, their styles, genres, and overall approaches to film-making were quite distinct. Carstairs' focus on light-hearted comedies and breezy narratives provided audiences with entertainment and escapism, while Hamer's tendency toward more satirical and darker humor allowed him to engage with deeper social issues and challenge the status quo. Despite these differences, each director significantly impacted the landscape of British cinema and left a lasting legacy in film history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process:  - A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket - The rocket is launched into space.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the body cools more happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER satelites in space.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in question considers the scenario where the body (satellite in this case) cools more than it typically does. To understand the potential effects of this hypothesis on larger satellites in space, we can examine each step of the satellite deployment process and assess the hypothesis's impact. 1. Determining the need for a satellite: Since this step focuses on identifying the objectives and requirements for the satellite, the cooling hypothesis may not have a direct impact on this step. 2. Designing the satellite: If the body cools more than usual, satellite designers may need to consider incorporating additional thermal management subsystems to account for this change in cooling rates. For larger satellites, this might mean more significant design changes to ensure the satellite's systems continue to operate effectively despite the increased cooling. 3. Designing the physical structure of the satellite: The cooling hypothesis could impact the materials selection and structural design of the satellite. Designers might need to accommodate for additional insulation or heat-generating components to counteract the increased cooling rates. 4. Building the satellite: The construction process might require further attention to detail and additional processes to install the required heat management systems for the perturbation hypothesis. This could lead to longer assembly times and potentially higher costs. 5. Packing the satellite into a capsule: An increased cooling rate might affect the packaging process, with the satellite needing more insulation or protective layers to maintain its optimal temperature during the launch and transit in space, especially for larger satellites. 6. Loading satellite capsule onto a rocket: Greater insulation or thermal management systems could add to the satellite's mass, potentially affecting the overall payload weight and size, which could require adjustments to the rocket's requirements. 7. Launching the rocket into space: If the increased cooling significantly affects larger satellites, it might exert additional stress on the rocket's performance, as it has to accommodate a potentially larger payload or additional equipment for thermal management. In conclusion, the proposed cooling perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the satellite deployment process. In particular, it could impact the design, construction, packaging, and launching phases, with larger satellites being more susceptible to these changes due to their size. Satellite designers and engineers would need to make adjustments to their designs and processes to account for the cooling perturbation hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Options: (i). Mellow.

Summarize: As your trainee progresses in their training, allow them to take the lead on certain tasks and projects. Start by having them take care of the daily routine without your help. Then, when you feel comfortable with their ability to handle the day-to-day, allow them to take lead on a particular project or project component.  There is no set time frame for when any one trainee should be taking lead on anything. Look at what your training schedule will allow. If you have a few weeks to work with your trainee, you may want to focus the last week on getting them independent. If you only have a few days, this may need to happen faster. Allowing them to take lead should mean that you are removing yourself from the process. Offer to assist your trainee if they want or need it, but otherwise leave it to them to perform the job functions. As you transition your position to your trainee, introduce them to other people who may be of help in completing their job. Look at those coworkers with whom you have worked in your position, and introduce your employee, explaining how, specifically, they may work with this person in the future.  Make sure your trainee has the phone numbers, email addresses and any other contact information they may need to get in touch with these new contacts on their own. If possible, try to arrange coffee or lunch so that your trainee can really get to know the person and their job functions, rather than just stopping by their desk. At some point before your trainee is completely on their own, you should schedule to stop performing your current job functions. If you are able, you may want to turn your attention toward your new position. Let your trainee take over the position while you still have training time with them so you are there in case they need help.  Let your trainee know well in advance when you plan to have them fully assume the position. Explain to them, “I will be there if you need help or if something comes up that we haven’t covered yet, but otherwise you are going to be taking on the job completely.” Let your supervisor know in advance, as well, and have them communicate with trainee first starting that day. At the end of the training period, do a final performance review with the trainee. This should primarily address their strength and growth, and place secondary emphasis on where they need to improve.  Ask your supervisor if they would like to sit in on this process to offer their praise and constructive criticism, as well. If you do talk to your trainee about areas where they may need to improve, do so through constructive criticism.

She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: From this Thursday, the monthly rate decision and the minutes of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting will be released together, without the normal fortnightly gap. Many see the new date as similar to the US's most important monthly release, the non-farm payrolls. But some say it is information overload. Both are key indicators for the whole economy. Every three months Super Thursday will also coincide with the release of the Bank's quarterly inflation report. This lunchtime, the Bank of England is releasing these three core items of economic data. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, says bringing these three announcements together will \\"enhance our transparency and make us more accountable to the British people\\". Super Thursday is the result of a review published in December by Governor Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve System, into the MPC's transparency. He said: \\"Members often find themselves in the uncomfortable position of necessarily obfuscating their views in public in the two-week gap between the policy meeting and the publication of the minutes. \\"This also leads to a blizzard of communications from MPC members in the short period between the release of the minutes and the 'purdah' period for the next policy meeting.\\" But the reform has not been greeted with universal enthusiasm. Some believe that with all the attention on the voting and the decision of the MPC, important data in the Inflation Report will be ignored. Larry Elliott, economics editor of the Guardian newspaper, called Super Thursday a \\"data dump\\" and said: \\"The information overload will make it harder not easier for the Bank's thinking to be scrutinised.\\" Philip Aldrick, of The Times newspaper, says there will be too much information for the markets to absorb \\"cleanly\\". \\"Wrapping up the Inflation Report with the rate decision and minutes is overkill\\". Former MPC member Andrew Sentance told the BBC that the MPC minutes were now being \\"rushed out\\". It used to be that the minutes would be published two weeks after the interest rate decision was made. Instead of taking two weeks to draft and re-draft the minutes it will now be done in just 18 hours, Mr Sentance said, and he is worried that the minutes will \\"not be as informative\\" as they could be. There used to be two rounds of drafts, and members of the MPC would then comment and meet to agree the final version of the minutes. To condense that to 18 hours is putting a lot of pressure on the committee and Bank staff, Mr Sentance said. As for the contents of the MPC minutes, many analysts are expecting them to show that two or possibly three policymakers voted for a rate rise this month. Steven Saywell, global currency strategist at BNP Paribas, told the BBC he expects three MPC members to have backed an increase. He added: \\"I think the market is behind the timing of an interest rate rise. February next year is likely. Markets have been pricing in next May.\\" Summary:","output":"The Bank of England has implemented its new \\"Super Thursday\\" policy, where the monthly rate decision, the minutes of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, and every three months, the Bank's quarterly inflation report, will all be released on the same day. The aim of this change is to \\"enhance transparency and make Bank of England more accountable to the British people\\" according to the Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney. However, there are concerns that this approach may lead to an information overload and make the Bank's thinking more difficult to scrutinize, as there will be too much information for the markets to absorb cleanly. Another concern is that the minutes of the MPC meeting will now be prepared in 18 hours, down from two weeks, potentially leading to less informative minutes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But there are classes that people can take to help them defeat the fear of flying. And now we are going to talk about similar training for service dogs that suffer from the same problem.  Service dogs almost never leave the side of the people they care for. You will see them working on buses, trains and other public transport systems. But the busy environment in an airport can trouble even the best trained working dog.  People with disabilities depend on their dogs. They also need the dogs to remain calmly on duty on the airplane, even when the flight is not smooth. This takes special training. The Air Hollywood K9 Flight School is one place where such help can be found.  The school has a piece of equipment that provides the sights, sounds and even the feel of an airplane in flight. It is called a flight simulator . The simulator was built for filming airplane scenes in movies.  Sandy Alexander lives in Newport Beach, California. He has a disability that requires his two-year-old dog, Doc, to be always at his side. Mr. Alexander took the dog to the flight school to get him ready for plane trips. He says Doc did not like the bumpy part of the flight simulation. \\"When that started he was pretty _ and looked up at me and wasn't sure what was gong on.\\"  \\"Dogs need to be exposed gradually and repetitively to stimulation, to the environment, to loud noises, to sounds and other dogs so that when this experience happens to them on a daily basis, they are able to act in a way that they are used to acting and don't get excitable,\\" days dog trainer, Mary Segall.

He has continued his success over the following years with critically acclaimed albums such as \\"Supreme Clientele\\" (2000) and \\"Fishscale\\" (2006). His stage name was taken from one of the characters in the 1979 kung fu film \\"Mystery of Chessboxing\\". He is the founder of his own label Starks Enterprises.  - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME's flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression.  - Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is the debut studio album by the American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, released November 9, 1993, on Loud Records and distributed through RCA Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during 1992 to 1993 at Firehouse Studio in New York City, and it was mastered at The Hit Factory. The album's title originates from the martial arts film \\"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\\" (1978). The group's \\"de facto\\" leader RZA, also known as Prince Rakeem, produced the album entirely, utilizing heavy, eerie beats and a sound largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples.  - Wu-Tang Clan is an American hip hop group from New York City, originally composed of East Coast rappers RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God and Masta Killa. Cappadonna later became an official member of the group. The group was formed in and is associated with the New York City borough of Staten Island.   - Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New York City in the U.S. state of New York. In the southwest of the city, Staten Island is the southernmost part of both the city and state of New York, with Conference House Park at the southern tip of the island and the state. The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2015 Census-estimated population of 474,558, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called \\"the forgotten borough\\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government.

He is the adopted son of wrestler \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase, who was Italian-American. DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry. DiBiase also spent time in the Georgia area where he had an early face run. One legendary angle had DiBiase enduring four piledrivers (one on the concrete floor and three in the ring) administered in the WTBS studio arena by The Fabulous Freebirds before his tag team partner, Tommy \\"Wildfire\\" Rich, threw in the towel (the angle of DiBiase being badly injured was so real the TBS studio audience could be seen crying). Rich and DiBiase later feuded, leading to a loser leaves town match which DiBiase won, but instead of Rich leaving the area, he donned a mask calling himself \\"Mister R.\\" The feud culminated in a match between Mister R and DiBiase, Rich appeared from backstage and distracted DiBiase. Mister R then rolled up DiBiase to get the win and unmasked as Brad Armstrong. Both DiBiase and Rich left the territory shortly thereafter.  In the early to mid-1980s, DiBiase participated in angles in various territories feuding with the likes of Ric Flair best known from this point in his Mid South return with the likes of Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds and One Man Gang. DiBiase turned heel against the Junkyard Dog and formed a group called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, ran Mid-south for months. Aligning with Skandor Akbar, Dibiase caused a riff with the group, namely Duggan. The two would feud until DiBiase lost a loser leave town match. He also held various championships and made frequent trips to All Japan Pro Wrestling until his eventual departure from Mid-South Wrestling (which by this point was now the UWF).

We want to find the value of 'c'. Here is the problem we have: 16*c = -3011 + 2851 First, we need to add together -3011 and 2851. We can think of this like having 3011 blue balls and taking away 2851 of them. After taking them away, we would be left with: -3011 + 2851 = -160 Now, our problem looks like this: 16*c = -160 To find the value of 'c', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 16. Imagine we have 16 groups of something, and we want to find out how many are in one group. So we'll do this: c = -160 ÷ 16 When we divide -160 by 16, we find that there are exactly -10 items in each group. So, the value of 'c' is: c = -10 I hope that helps!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.  - In chemistry isomerization (also isomerisation) is the process by which one molecule is transformed into another molecule which has exactly the same atoms, but the atoms have a different arrangement e.g. A-B-C  B-A-C (these related molecules are known as isomers ). In some molecules and under some conditions, isomerization occurs spontaneously. Many isomers are equal or roughly equal in bond energy, and so exist in roughly equal amounts, provided that they can interconvert somewhat freely; that is, the energy barrier between the two isomers is not too high. When the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it is considered a rearrangement reaction.  - In chemistry, bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") is the measure of bond strength in a chemical bond. IUPAC defines bond energy as the average value of the gas-phase bond dissociation energies (usually at a temperature of 298 K) for all bonds of the same type within the same chemical species. For example, the carbonhydrogen bond energy in methane \\"H\\"(CH) is the enthalpy change involved with breaking up one molecule of methane into a carbon atom and four hydrogen radicals, divided by 4. Tabulated bond energies are generally values of bond energies averaged over a number of selected typical chemical species containing that type of bond. Bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") should not be confused with bond-dissociation energy. Bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies in a molecule, and will show a different value for a given bond than the bond-dissociation energy would. This is because the energy required to break a single bond in a specific molecule differs for each bond in that molecule. For example, methane has four CH bonds and the bond-dissociation energies are 435 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH) and 339 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CH). Their average, and hence the bond energy, is 414 kJ/mol, even though not a single bond required specifically 414 kJ/mol to be broken.  - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.  - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion.  - In chemistry , photoisomerization is molecular behavior in which structural change between isomers is caused by photoexcitation . Both reversible and irreversible isomerization reactions exist . However , the word \`\` photoisomerization '' usually indicates a reversible process .  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.  - An isomer (from Greek , isomerès; isos = \\"equal\\", méros = \\"part\\") is a molecule with the same molecular formula as another molecule, but with a different chemical structure. That is, isomers contain the same number of atoms of each element, but have different arrangements of their atoms. Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have the same functional groups. There are two main forms of isomerism (or ): structural isomerism (or constitutional isomerism) and stereoisomerism (or spatial isomerism).  - A chemical compound (or just compound if used in the context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number.  - A rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2:  - A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur.  - Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules. They also include forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles (e.g., atoms or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces  the forces which keep a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.  - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).  - A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \\"strong bonds\\" or \\"primary bond\\" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and \\"weak bonds\\" or \\"secondary bond\\" such as Dipole-dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.

He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam made his (ODI) debut in a home series against West Indies in 1991, and made a good start to his career by scoring 20 and 60 runs in two matches against West Indies. This was followed by 48, 60, 101, and 117 runs against Sri Lanka.  Handpicked by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan for the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, 22-year-old Inzamam was relatively unheard of before the tournament. To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan's dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament.  Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start. These innings established Inzamam's billing as a big-game player, although he was unable to replicate his World Cup success in later tournaments.  Inzamam regard his best least highlighted innings of 90 not out against West Indies when Pakistan won their first ODI in the West Indies on 27 March 1993.  In total, Inzamam set a record for scoring the most half centuries in One Day Internationals, 83 - though this is now surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis and Kumar Sangakkara. He also became the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in One-day Internationals (again after Tendulkar) and was named in the ICC World XI for both Tests and One-day Internationals in the 2005 ICC Awards. In his final ODI for Pakistan, playing against Zimbabwe in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he took three catches whilst fielding, including the last one of the match, ending his One Day career.

Google, in partnership with Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) and the Galapagos National Parks Directorate (GNPD), sent hikers to the Galapagos Islands with Street View Trekker equipment to take panoramic images of its wildlife. The hikers captured thousands of images using the football-like cameras mounted on a tower on top of the 42lb (19kg) computer backpacks. We brought","output":"our best team of photo and mapping experts to ensure that this fragile ecosystem was captured accurately and responsibly, while maintaining the highest level of respect for the natural habitats of this unique location. As part of our mission to make the world a more accessible place, this project was aimed at not only helping scientists and researchers in their ongoing work but also to raise awareness about the unique biodiversity that the Galapagos Islands have to offer. The 19 islands and surrounding waters of the Galapagos archipelago are home to nearly 3,000 unique species, including many that are found nowhere else on Earth. This rich diversity of life has long been a source of fascination for scientists and researchers alike, and Google's Street View project aims to bring this incredible wealth of natural beauty to an even larger audience. Throughout our time on the islands, the team took great care to minimize any potential disruptions to the marine and terrestrial environments in which we worked. As part of our collaboration with CDF and GNPD, we strictly adhered to guidelines that allowed us to safely and sustainably capture the stunning scenes and rare species that make the Galapagos one of the most biologically diverse places on Earth. Some of the unforgettable sights captured during our expedition were the iconic Giant Tortoises lounging by lagoons, the Blue-footed Boobies performing their mating dance, and the peculiar Marine Iguanas basking on the rocky shores. These images not only showcase the incredible beauty of the Galapagos, but they also offer viewers an unparalleled educational experience, providing a window into the unique ecosystems that exist on these volcanic islands. Additionally, Google's Street View also provides valuable information and data to aid in the ongoing conservation efforts that exist aimed at preserving these islands' precious ecosystems. The detailed images captured during our expedition can help to monitor changes in the environment like vegetation growth, animal populations, and the impact of visitor foot traffic on the delicate habitats of the island chain. After several months of capturing, processing, and curating the images taken during the expedition, Google's Galapagos Islands Street View was finally launched in September 2013. This interactive visual experience allows millions of people around the globe to virtually explore the islands and bear witness to their unmatched natural beauty from the comfort of their own homes. Ultimately, the results of this collaboration between Google, the Charles Darwin Foundation, and the Galapagos National Parks Directorate will serve as a powerful tool for promoting conservation, education, and awareness about this extraordinary set of Islands. Our hope is that by bringing the Galapagos to life through innovative technology like Google's Street View, we can inspire future generations of scientists, researchers, and environmental stewards to join us in the ongoing effort to preserve and protect the fragile and irreplaceable biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.'

Here is an article: Here's the good news about the pageant of economic fecklessness staged this summer by Congress and the : The widespread voter disgust it generated improves the chances for to reset the debate by proposing a set of bold initiatives. of the Midwest to promote a jobs package. Thus far his program's ambitions are meager indeed, encompassing a 30-billion infrastructure improvement bank and 160 billion from unemployment and payroll tax extensions. With unemployment at 9.1% nationally and 11.8% in California, a much grander strategy is needed to address persistent joblessness and weak consumer spending. So here are some suggestions for what Obama should and can do. Several new economic studies show that the worst head wind against economic recovery comes from the dismal state of American families' balance sheets. Even after years of proliferating foreclosures and cutbacks of credit card balances, household debt today is 11.5 trillion, 2 1/2 times the level of 1999 and on average nearly 120% of disposable income. is mortgage debt. That's a nearly unprecedented drag on household net worth, and one that prevents families from spending at the level needed for recovery. before, the administration's homeowner rescue efforts have been pathetic. As part of the 700-billion banking bailout of 2008, about 50 billion was supposed to be devoted to mortgage relief, including nearly 30 billion to the mortgage modification program known as HAMP. Of that sum, only about 2 billion had been spent as of June 30, according to the bailout program's inspector general. The government made sure that bailout money got to the banks, even some that didn't want it. But homeowners have gotten barely a taste. That remaining HAMP money is part of in the bailout program that may still be available for disbursement, according to the inspector general, depending on how it's used. Obama may not need a further congressional vote to use it. His first order of business should be to dramatically restructure HAMP, say by taking the initiative for mortgage modifications away from the banks, which have done almost nothing but gum up the process. And then put that money to use. Another idea the White House should get behind is a \\"right to rent\\" law that has been kicking around Congress since 2008. Strapped and underwater homeowners facing foreclosure would have to be offered the option of turning over their mortgages to their banks and renting their homes for five-year terms at market rents. At the end of the term they would be offered the option to reacquire the property at its then-market price. This plan would encourage banks to negotiate modified mortgages more seriously, as banks want to be landlords even less than they want to be real estate owners. It would cut way back on the problem of abandoned or trashed properties, as the foreclosed owners would have an incentive to keep them maintained. It would reduce the cost of housing for affected families to a more rational level, as rents in foreclosure-rich zones have generally fallen well below mortgage payments. And it could be done without any cost to the government. The 30-billion infrastructure bank, which resembles a bipartisan idea that has been kicking around Congress for too long (the co-sponsors are Sens. John Kerry [D-Mass.] and Kay Bailey Hutchison [R-Tex.]) is a start, but only a start. If the public-private partnerships would really create a gain of more than 600 billion over 10 years for every 10 billion spent from the public till, as they suggest, why take a cheeseparing approach? A 100-billion fund would create 6 trillion in value, and given the sorry state of the U.S. infrastructure, that would only scratch the surface of what's needed as an investment in future economic growth. Let's see Obama put a truly ambitious program on the table, and let's hear the in Congress explain why we don't need the work. Today's Pentagon spending defines the old saw about the military always fighting the last war. The defense budget in 1963, in the thick of the Cold War, was 51 billion. Accounting for inflation, today's 700-billion budget is twice that size — and almost all of the increase occurred under . As defense expert Lawrence J. Korb observes, from Pentagon spending and still be at about the level reached under Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Clinton. Keeping the money in the economy but reallocating it could yield a true peace dividend: Not only more money for domestic infrastructure, but a revitalized GI Bill for returning service members, educational opportunities for thousands of other Americans, and tax relief for the middle and working classes. At the moment, many conservative lawmakers hew to the line that federal assistance is creeping socialism if it benefits anyone other than their campaign contributors. (I am indebted to 's \\"Catch-22\\" for the paraphrase.) As the pain of the downturn continues to be felt by the constituents of even the most conservative lawmakers, it's possible that some of them will be steered away from narrow self-interest and ideological purity and toward wisdom and statesmanship. This process can be pushed along if Obama places a strong strategic initiative on the table and challenges opponents to explain what's wrong with it. An essential step is to remind voters of the scale and nature of the downturn, and therefore the scale and nature of the required response. The administration made a rookie mistake in 2009 by tying its original stimulus proposal to a forecast that unemployment would peak at 8% with stimulus, but rise to 9% without it. The downturn was already making those projections moot, but their relative optimism allowed Washington to rationalize a much smaller stimulus than conditions demanded. And now, of course, congressional resistance to a second stimulus is seemingly implacable. \\"They should have done everything they could think of, then as the economy recovered they could have cut back,\\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith. \\"Then when the economy did in fact recover then you start trimming back — it's easy to trim back, but it's terribly difficult to come back for a second bite of the apple.\\" One can judge how much better the economy would look today if the original stimulus had been larger. Economists Alan Blinder of Princeton and Mark Zandi of that the stimulus would increase 2011 gross domestic product by 1.8 trillion over what it would have been otherwise, accounting for 10 million more jobs and an unemployment rate 6.5 percentage points lower than in an unstimulated economy. Their figures resemble the findings of the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office. The biggest threat to the economic recovery is Washington's adherence to the notion that the best way to spur hiring and consumer demand is to do nothing. The self-congratulation displayed by the president and congressional leaders over resolving the debt-limit crisis amounted to their acting boastfully about something they should have been ashamed of. To quote Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" again: \\"That's a trick that never seems to fail.\\" But Heller was a cynic. The current economic downturn may make realists of us yet.

Emily possessed an impressive array of skills: her speed and endurance were unmatched, her agility and awareness on the field were unparalleled, and her ability to read the game and make split-second decisions always left her opponents guessing. The joy and pride Felicia felt while witnessing Emily's growth not only as an athlete but also as a person will forever remain etched in her heart. What truly set Emily apart from other athletes, however, was her unwavering dedication to not only honing her craft but also pushing herself to reach new heights. Felicia had lost count of the number of times she had seen her friend go through grueling workout sessions, determined to push past her limits, only to come back and do it all over again the following day, never faltering in her commitment to excel. Off the field, Emily's steadfast dedication extended to her academics and her personal relationships. Along with her thriving sports career, she managed to maintain stellar grades and was just as nurturing and supportive in her friendships as Felicia was. This resilient spirit was what truly captured Felicia's admiration for her friend. As Felicia continued to watch Emily weave her way through the opposing team's defense, expertly dribbling the ball and seemingly dancing around her opponents, she couldn't help but smile. It was a great source of joy for her to have such an exceptional individual like Emily in her life, and she knew that she would continue to support and uplift her friend, both on and off the field, for as long as their cherished friendship endured."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The duo, known for their exceptional skills in handling time-related emergencies, often embark on dangerous missions to prevent catastrophes and safeguard humanity's history. As our story begins, Berus and Thon return from a time-bending mission, only to find that they have become fugitives of their own time period. Unbeknownst to them, while they were away on their mission, a shadowy figure invaded TEPA headquarters and planted incriminating evidence, framing Berus and Thon for heinous crimes against history. The unknown assailant manipulated past events, leading to falsified records and memories that implicated the two friends in a sequence of catastrophic events that threatened the very existence of the future world. Arrested by their fellow temporal agents, Berus and Thon are put on trial to defend themselves against the overwhelming evidence crafted by the mysterious orchestrator. With TEPA's top prosecutors bent on proving the duo's guilt, Berus and Thon find themselves in an uphill battle to clear their names. The stakes are high: if found guilty, they will face excommunication from TEPA and eternal imprisonment in a time-loop void, which would effectively erase them from history. Determined to expose the truth, Berus and Thon devise a secret plan to unravel the layers of deception and unveil the identity of the invisible villain. As the trial progresses, the friends make efficient use of their intimate knowledge of time travel, combing through past events for clues and employing time-bending strategies to counter the fabricated evidence against them. Throughout their gripping investigation, Berus and Thon uncover a web of deceit and political intrigue within TEPA itself. They reveal that several high-ranking officials within the organization have been corrupted, pushing for personal gains and power by playing with the very fabric of time. This discovery paints an even bleaker future for them as they appear to be utterly alone in their fight for justice. As the trial reaches its climax, an unexpected ally emerges: Rew, a rookie temporal agent who stumbled upon a critical piece of evidence, pointing to a malicious time-traveler known as the Time Serpent. Berus and Thon present this evidence at the 11th hour, provoking a confrontation with the Time Serpent, who reveals himself to be the villainous mastermind behind the entire conspiracy. The trial is suspended, and a high-stakes pursuit across the continuum ensues, as Berus, Thon, and Rew engage the Time Serpent in a vicious battle of skill and wits. Their intense conflict culminates in a showdown at the dawn of the universe, the very moment the Time Serpent seeks to corrupt to achieve total control over the course of history. With their combined efforts, the three heroes successfully vanquish the Time Serpent, undoing his nefarious manipulations and restoring the timeline to its original state. Berus and Thon are exonerated of all charges, as the TEPA leadership is purged and reformed under the new guidance of the truth-seeking heroes. \\"The Chronicles of Berus and Thon: The Trial of Times\\" ends on a hopeful note as the duo takes on new responsibilities within TEPA, with an aim to reshape the organization and ensure that no such conspiracies can take place in the future. As they, along with their new friend Rew, forge ahead to explore the vast intricacies of time, the film leaves audiences eagerly anticipating the endless adventures that lie ahead."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the small rural town in South Australia that the Victor Harbor Road bypasses?

Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Context: Parker died on March 12, 1955, in the suite of his friend and patroness Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City, while watching The Dorsey Brothers' Stage Show on television. The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had an advanced case of cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker's 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age.  Since 1950, Parker had been living with Chan Berg, the mother of his son Baird (who lived until 2014) and his daughter Pree (who died as an infant of cystic fibrosis). He considered Chan his wife although he never married her, nor did he divorce his previous wife, Doris, whom he had married in 1948. His marital status complicated the settling of Parker's estate and would ultimately serve to frustrate his wish to be quietly interred in New York City.  Dizzy Gillespie paid for the funeral arrangements and organized a lying-in-state, a Harlem procession officiated by Congressman and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., as well as a memorial concert. Parker's body was flown back to Missouri, in accordance with his mother's wishes. Berg criticized Doris and Parker's family for giving him a Christian funeral, even though they knew he was a confirmed atheist. Parker was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Missouri, in a hamlet known as Blue Summit, located close to I-435 and East Truman Road.  Parker's estate is managed by Jampol Artist Management. Question: What else happened after his death?. Whats the answer?","output":"After Charlie Parker's death, many things happened. People who loved his music and admired him wanted to remember him and honor his contributions to jazz. So, they organized special events and paid tribute to his life and work. 1. Dizzy Gillespie, a famous jazz musician and friend of Parker, paid for the funeral arrangements. He also organized a lying-in-state, which is when people can come and see the person who died. They can say their goodbyes and show their respect. 2. There was a big procession in Harlem, a neighborhood in New York City, where a lot of people who loved jazz lived. A man named Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., who was both a Congressman and a Reverend, helped lead this event. 3. A memorial concert was organized, and people played Charlie Parker's music to celebrate his life and work. This was a way for people to come together and remember how amazing he was as a musician. 4. Charlie Parker's body was flown back to Missouri, which is where his mom wanted him to be buried. He was buried in a cemetery called Lincoln Cemetery, in a place called Blue Summit. It's close to some big roads, so people can visit and pay their respects. Some people were not happy with the way the funeral was done because Charlie Parker didn't believe in God, but they gave him a Christian funeral anyway. His personal life was also a little complicated, which made it hard to settle his estate — meaning figuring out what to do with all his things and money after he died. Today, a company called Jampol Artist Management takes care of his estate and makes sure his music and legacy continue to be shared with the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Women do not want to 'have it all' in life, they just want what men have, Miriam Clegg has claimed. The high-flying lawyer, married to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, insisted she wanted to be able to combine a successful professional life with having a family. Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband does his share of the chores, with one of them making sure they are at home every evening for their three sons. Miriam Clegg insisted she does not want to 'have it all', but wants to be able to combine a successful career with family life. Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow. In a surprise intervention at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mrs Clegg spoke about how she juggles her career with raising her children, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all'. But speaking to Sky News, she made clear that the decision to choose Mr Clegg as her husband and father of her children was more important to her than any lifestyle aspirations. And she said she had been fortunate to be able 'naturally' to find a way to share household chores and childcare duties with her politician husband. Spanish-born Mrs Clegg was speaking during a visit to a Glasgow college to address female students as part of the Inspiring Women campaign to enable girls to meet successful women from all walks of life who can act as role models. Asked whether she was able to provide the girls with an example of how women can 'have it all', Mrs Clegg told Sky News: 'I never understand what people mean when they say 'having it all'. I personally have never wanted to 'have it all' as a general aim. I just want to have what men have. 'Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have. 'There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men. 'But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with.' Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband Nick does his share of the household chores, and they try to make sure one of them is at home each evening for their sons. Nick and Miriam Clegg visited Castehill Primary School in Glasgow. Nick Clegg has looked to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school yesterday. She made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister was ready to share housework with her, and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening. 'There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children,' she said. 'If you look across society and across different countries, certainly in the Western world, women still get a very big proportion of the chores at home and I certainly know lots of women who before they leave to go to work have done half a day's work at home, and when they get home there is the other half to do. 'That doesn't happen to me. It is not an issue for people like you and I who can get help. It is an issue for those who can't get help, who don't have the money or circumstances to get help. Asked whether she had worked out in advance with her husband what compromises they would have to make to combine two high-flying careers with a family life, she said: 'Life is all about compromises. 'There is always a certain equilibrium and in my case, we found it naturally, but I do understand that there are people who plan. I'm just not very good with plans. 'We tend to share it very naturally. We make a point of one of us being home most evenings and on the whole we manage.' Mrs Clegg said she had not suffered from open sexism in her professional life, and felt it was important to give girls the self-confidence to aim high in the world of work. 'I think we have made a lot of progress, but there is still a little bit more progress to make,' she said. 'I think it is good for the girls to see the many options that are available for them. 'I haven't come across open discrimination against me. In terms of a little hidden sexism, I think there are lots of women who do face that.' Mrs Clegg yesterday joined her husband on a visit to Castlehill Primary School, Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire. Mrs Clegg said that when speaking to young women around the UK, 'something I have really noticed that I don't see so much from boys is we get lots of questions about self-confidence'. She added: 'I wonder if there is something a little bit specific to girls there, and in particular in relation to certain subjects - science subjects. 'I do think it is important to celebrate female achievement and aiming high as part of the lesson we want to give to the girls that aiming high is as good for girls as it is for boys.' Asked if she would give her sons different advice to that which she offers girls, Mrs Clegg said: 'Not necessarily. I go on with my boys about how you have to make an effort and everything really depends on you. 'If you really want to summarise what I hope that at the end of the whole educational process they would retain, I hope it is that.' Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband's question-and-answer session.","output":"Miriam Clegg, a high-flying lawyer and wife of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, shared her perspective on work-life balance and gender roles in a recent interview.

In their home, the couple shares chores which she pointed out is not always the case, especially for those who cannot afford help. However, she believes society has made progress in encouraging more equal distribution of household duties among couples.

Given the below context:  The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A rare glimpse of the Ili Pika      Everyone on social media is talking about China's \\"magic bunny\\", the cutest endangered animal that you have never heard of.      Sixty-year-old retired conservationist Li Weidong has been on a mission for over 30 years to document and protect the highly-endangered Ili Pika - a mysterious rabbit-like mammal only found in China. With less than 1,000 left they are now rarer than pandas.      Mr Li first spotted the \\"magic bunny\\" in 1983.      He remembers his first encounter vividly. \\"I had been climbing a mountain for four hours, and was just catching my breath, when suddenly, I saw the shadow of a small creature running by.\\"      \\"I sat down next to some rocks, and suddenly two bunny ears emerged from the crack of one of the rocks. The little thing was staring at me, blinking at me. I thought it was the most beautiful and bizarre creature I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe my eyes.\\"      Image caption Mr Li first spotted the animal in 1983 in the mountains of the Ili Prefecture      At the time Mr Li was working on disease prevention. He was not looking to discover a new species.      There are many different kinds of pikas - small rabbit-like mammals with short limbs and round ears - but unlike other pikas, the one Mr Li spotted had three distinct brown stripes on its forehead and around its neck.      After three years of research, Mr Li and his team named the little creature the Ili Pika, after the area where it is found, the Ili Prefecture on the far west side of China's Xinjiang province.      New danger      Scientifically known as Ochotona iliensis, the Ili Pika live in holes between bare rocks at an altitude of 2,800m (9, 186ft) to 4,000m. They are used to living on the extremely cold plateau and feeding on herbs found in the Tian Shan mountains.      After he made the discovery, Mr Li and his fellow conservationists decided to take measures to protect the pikas. But they did not want any publicity.      They thought it was better to leave the pikas alone in their natural habitat.      Image caption The Ili Pika lives in holes in the bare rock and is hunted by foxes, weasels and birds      The natural prey of foxes, weasels and birds, the Ili Pika now face a new danger.      In the past 30 years, their habitat has shrunk by 71%, Mr Li said. This is partly because of climate change and partly because their grazing area has been taken over by a growing population of people at the bottom of the mountain.      \\"The Ili Pikas all live on isolated mountain tops, so their habitats are highly fragmented,\\" Mr Li explains. \\"Losing even one is detrimental for the entire group.\\"      Mr Li saw the mysterious pika a few more times including in 1990. But then he did not see one again for 24 years.      Ancient species      The Ili Pika shot to fame after the National Geographic profiled it. Now it has gone viral. The sudden rise to fame worries Mr Li.      \\"Many people have written to me to say they want to help me protect the pikas,\\" he said. \\"But more attention also means more danger for them.\\"      Ili Pika is an ancient species. \\"We cannot let them disappear in front of our eyes.\\" ||||| Beijing (CNN) Native to a remote region of China, this tiny mammal, known as the Ili pika, doesn't know it's a member of an endangered species -- and neither do most people.      Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, in 1983 and named it after his hometown, Ili.      Last July, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery.      \\"I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,\\" he told CNN.      \\"If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty.\\"      In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li.      Shrinking habitat      The Ili pika photographed by Li Weidong in July 2014.      The mammal, only 20 centimeters long, lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations. Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming.      Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops, Li said.      Ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters, he said. Now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters.      \\"They have nowhere else to retreat,\\" he added.      It's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species, so if predators are near, Ili pikas are not able to alert each other, Li said.      Disease may also be a factor in its decline.      Empty handed      In 1983, when Li first came across the mammal, nobody knew what it was. Two years later, Li found another two and it was declared a new species.      In the decade following, Li and his colleagues conducted a number of studies, including a census at 14 different sites.      The pika may have inspired the famous Pokemon character, Pikachu.      However, in 1992, Li left Ili to work with Xinjiang Academy of Environmental Protection in the regional capital Urumqi.      No studies were conducted on Ili pika in the following decade. No one saw the pika, either.      In 2002 and 2003, Li, with a team of volunteers, conducted a fresh census. Despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips, they came up empty handed.      However, by analyzing droppings and snow tracks, Li, along with Arizona State University biologist Andrew Smith, was able to conclude that the Ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline. Together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals, down from 2,900 in the early 1990s.      The research, published in 2005, recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered.      'Magic rabbit'      In 2007, Li retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika.      Scientist Li Weidong points to where he and his team spotted the Ili pika in July 2014.      Last year, he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras.      This time, on the second day of the field trip, they finally spotted a pika, who jumped and stepped over Li's feet while he was trying to photograph it. The volunteers dubbed it a \\"magic rabbit.\\"      They concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 Ili pikas, said Li.      \\"This tiny species could be extinct any time,\\" he said. \\"They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore.\\"      Li funds the research with himself, along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature      He says he has spent more than 32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas.      But what upsets Li most isn't the lack of funding. It's the lack of official recognition for the Ili, and other pikas' plight.      The Ili pika isn't included on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law.      The Department for Wildlife and Forest Plants Protection, under the Ministry of Forestry, said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details.      Li and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal.      \\"I'm almost 60, and soon I won't be able to climb the Tianshan Mountains,\\" he said.      \\"So I really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the Ili Pika.\\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

It is very rare and endangered, which means there aren't many of them left. There are fewer than 1,000 Ili Pikas, making them even rarer than pandas. A man named Li Weidong discovered the Ili Pika in 1983, and he has been trying to protect them ever since. These animals live high up in the mountains and like to eat herbs. They are hunted by foxes, weasels, and birds. Sadly, the Ili Pika's home is shrinking because of climate change and people moving into the area. Li Weidong hopes that people can help protect the Ili Pika and their home before they disappear forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: It doesn’t matter if it’s an aluminum or rubber balloon. They’re sold at party centers or you could rent a helium tank to fill up your own balloons for a special event. You’ll know a balloon is filled with helium if it floats. Helium is lighter than air, so it naturally rises. If a balloon stays down near the ground, it doesn’t have helium in it. If you don’t have a safety pin, a pushpin or sewing needle will work just the same. Use the pin to prick the balloon and create a really small hole, and then squeeze the hole shut with your fingers to keep the helium from escaping until you’re ready to inhale. If the balloon is inflated but not knotted, you don’t need to poke a hole in it. You can simply suck the air directly from the opening. Don’t just hold the helium in your mouth—breathe it in like you would a normal breath of air. Just 3-4 seconds should be enough to fill your lungs with helium.  It helps to exhale fully before inhaling so that you can get as much helium into your lungs at once as possible. Helium doesn’t have an odor, taste, or smell, so you really won’t be able to tell that you’re breathing in an element different from oxygen until you try to speak. As soon as you’ve finished inhaling, start talking! The helium-effect will only last for 5 seconds or so, so don’t wait too long. What you say is totally up to you! Have fun and come up with unique phrases or just repeat your name over and over again to hear how you sound. If you suck too much helium at once or for too long of a period of time, you can hurt yourself. So between each inhalation of helium, take a few minutes to breathe normally. Summary:","output":"Helium balloons can be purchased or filled using a rented helium tank. To inhale helium, use a pin to create a small hole in the balloon and prevent the helium from escaping by pinching the hole. Alternatively, inhale directly from an unknotted balloon. Exhale fully, then inhale helium for 3-4 seconds. Helium has no odor, taste, or smell, and its effect on your voice only lasts for about 5 seconds. Be cautious not to inhale too much helium and take breaks to breathe normally to avoid harm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which month is warmer in the northern hemisphere, July or January?  Hint: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. The answer to this question is:","output":"July is warmer in the northern hemisphere than January. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt, which causes the northern hemisphere to be exposed to more direct sunlight during the months of May, June, and July. As a result, the Sun appears higher in the sky during these summer months, leading to increased solar flux and higher temperatures. Furthermore, because of the phenomenon known as seasonal lag, the warmest months in the northern hemisphere are typically June, July, and August. Conversely, the southern hemisphere experiences its warmest months during December, January, and February, when it is tilted towards the Sun. This is also when the Sun is higher in the sky for the southern hemisphere, resulting in increased solar flux and warmer temperatures. However, both hemispheres use the same calendar, which might cause confusion for someone like Stan, who moved from the US (northern hemisphere) to Australia (southern hemisphere).

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

Article:","output":"Title: International Wine Challenge Winners Highlight Rise of Supermarket Labels Introduction: The International Wine Challenge (IWC) has once again acknowledged the growing popularity of supermarket wines by awarding a staggering 360 medals to an array of supermarket brands. Marks & Spencer emerged as the clear winner, snagging six gold, 50 silver, and 82 bronze awards. The IWC's recognition of supermarket labels attests to their increasing social acceptance among wine enthusiasts. Step 1: Briefly explain the International Wine Challenge The International Wine Challenge is a prestigious annual event that celebrates the best wines from around the world, attracting entries from winemakers across the globe. Through a rigorous blind tasting competition, the IWC identifies and rewards the top wines in various categories, encouraging the global wine industry to continually raise the bar in quality and innovation. Step 2: Highlight the achievements of M&S in the IWC Marks & Spencer, a leading British supermarket, secured top honors at this year's IWC, demonstrating the growing consumer appreciation for supermarket wines. Out of the 360 medals awarded to supermarkets, M&S walked away with 138, including an impressive six gold medals. In addition to M&S, several other supermarket brands also performed notably at the competition, suggesting a significant shift in consumer attitudes towards supermarket wines. Step 3: Discuss the statement by the IWC on supermarket brands According to the IWC, supermarket brands are becoming more socially accepted due to their growing quality and affordability. It is now common for wine enthusiasts to explore and discover exceptional wines from supermarket aisles. This increased visibility has translated into increased sales and industry recognition, with supermarket brands competing with established wine labels for top prizes at international competitions. Step 4: Analyze the factors behind the growing popularity of supermarket wines The rise of supermarket wines can be attributed to various factors, including increased investment in quality wine production, attractive pricing, and the convenience of purchasing wines during regular grocery shopping. Furthermore, the diverse range of wines offered by supermarkets enables consumers to experiment with different styles and regions, fostering an adventurous spirit among wine enthusiasts. Supermarkets have also benefited from partnering with renowned winemakers, who can bring their expertise and reputation to the supermarket brand. Step 5: Conclusion and future outlook With the International Wine Challenge awarding numerous medals to supermarket wines, it is evident that these previously underrated labels have gained widespread recognition and acceptance among both casual drinkers and experts. This reflects the growing trend of consumers seeking high-quality wines at affordable prices. As supermarket brands continue to invest in wine production and diversify their offerings, it is likely that their market share and status within the wine industry will only continue to flourish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a question about the following article: Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze   was a Georgian nobleman and King of Imereti as George VI  from 1702 to 1707. He was a member of the prominent Abashidze family. The youngest son of Prince Paata Abashidze, he was served as a priest until about 1684 when he entered politics after the death of his elder brother Paata Abashidze and began aggressively expanding his patrimonial fiefdom. He dispossessed the Chkheidze family of Shorapani, and the Agiashvili of Tsutskhvati, and took control of the royal domain in Upper Imereti. His daughter, Tamar, was married to the two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander IV and George V. During the reign of the latter monarch, Abashidze effectively ran the government and acted as an all-powerful kingmaker. In 1699, he gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700. In 1701, Abashidze compelled King Mamia of Imereti to abdicate and seized the throne for himself. He managed to establish a degree of stability in Imereti and ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, triggering a military response in 1703. He also patronized culture and learning. Deposed after a revolt by the nobles, in favour of the rightful Bagrationi king George VII, Abashidze took refuge at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in Tbilisi. He died there in 1722, and was buried in the Katskhi monastery in Imereti. Question about the article:","output":"How did Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze's actions, such as expanding his patrimonial fiefdom, influencing royal marriages, and seizing the throne, contribute to his rise as a powerful nobleman and eventual King of Imereti as George VI from 1702 to 1707?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 14-year-old son of a 'hero' police traffic officer who died as he helped a stranded motorist on a motorway hard shoulder was in tears as he followed his father's coffin at his funeral service. Ben Goodlad clutched the white-topped police cap of PC Mark Goodlad, 41, as he walked into Wakefield Cathedral, past an honour guard of scores of the officer's colleagues from West Yorkshire Police. The misty centre of Wakefield came to a stop as the funeral cortege, which was led by police motorcyclists and horses, drew up outside the cathedral, between lines of officers. A father and husband: Ben Goodlad, 14, was in tears as he watched the procession alongside and his mother Helen. A hero: PC Mark Goodlad's son Ben, 14, and widow, Helen watch as his coffin is carried out of Wakefield Cathedral after the funeral. Ben and PC Goodlad's widow, Helen, travelled behind the hearse in a marked police traffic car. Members of the public joined the lines of police outside as the family followed the coffin through the main doors of the cathedral. Among the officers outside was West Yorkshire Police's chief constable Sir Norman Bettison who also read a eulogy at the packed service. Sir Norman said the dedication PC Goodlad showed on October 24, when he died as he helped a woman who was stranded on the hard shoulder of the M1 near Wakefield, was typical of him. He told the congregation: 'He would put on his uniform and the cap that now sits on his coffin, and go out to face risk, threat and harm wherever they arose. 'After a gruelling, exhausting night shift he would do it all over again the following day. 'That is what police officers, special constables and PCSOs do the length and breadth of this magnificent force and that is why I am able to say that it is my honour to speak today about our departed colleague Mark Goodlad. 'He stands for what is best in all of us. Tribute in numbers: Led by mounted officers, the funeral procession makes its way through a guard of honour. Pallbearers: PC Goodlad's coffin is carried out Wakefield Cathedral by colleagues from West Yorkshire Police. Chief Constable's words: 'We shouldn't define heroes by the way they die but recognise them instead by the way they lived their lives' 'We shouldn't define heroes by the way they die but recognise them instead by the way they lived their lives. 'On that basis, Mark is a hero.' PC Goodlad died when an orange Scania articulated heavy goods vehicle hit a marked BMW X5 police car and a grey Suzuki Swift on the southbound carriageway. The police car and the Suzuki were both stationary on the hard shoulder. PC Goodlad was between the two vehicles, helping the 51-year-old female Suzuki driver. The woman suffered minor injuries in the incident. Crash scene: PC Goodlad, 41, was killed on the hard shoulder of the M1 while helping a stranded motorist.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Eating arroz con leche (rice pudding) can be an enjoyable and delightful experience if you follow proper steps and techniques. The objective is to savor this delicious dessert while also engaging in a logical and practical approach.  Before evaluating the solutions, let's consider some basic elements of naive physics reasoning. Naive physics is the study of our commonsense understanding of how the physical world works. When it comes to eating arroz con leche, naive physics principles might involve the visual appearance of the dish, the consistency of the ingredients, and the use of eating utensils. Given the background, let's consider two possible solutions and determine which one is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. Solution A: 1. Select an appropriately sized bowl or cup for the arroz con leche. 2. Ensure that the arroz con leche has cooled down to a temperature comfortable for eating. 3. Take a suitable eating utensil, such as a spoon, that allows you to scoop up the correct portion of rice and milk mixture in each bite. 4. Hold the spoon using your dominant hand, and scoop up a reasonable amount of arroz con leche, making sure you get a well-balanced portion of rice and milk mixture. 5. Gently blow on the spoonful of arroz con leche to help cool it down further if needed. 6. Bring the spoon to your mouth, and slowly savor the flavors of the arroz con leche as you eat it, chewing as necessary. 7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until you finish eating the arroz con leche. Solution B: 1. Pour the arroz con leche onto a flat plate or an inappropriate container. 2. Let the arroz con leche cool down without considering its ideal eating temperature. 3. Use an illogical utensil, such as a knife, to eat the mixture. 4. Attempt to pick up the rice and milk with the knife, regardless of practicality and efficiency. 5. Eat the arroz con leche without savoring or enjoying its unique flavor. 6. Continue to struggle with the ineffective approach to eating until you lose interest or give up. Comparing the two solutions, it is clear that Solution A is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. It takes into account factors such as appropriate eating utensils, proper dishware, and the temperature of the dish, which align better with a commonsense understanding of how the physical world works. Additionally, Solution A focuses on an enjoyable and practical eating experience, whereas Solution B disregards these factors and provides a less logical and impractical approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Rabbi Gil Steinlauf Comes Out As Gay, Supported By Wife And Congregation In an empowering and courageous display of transparency, Rabbi Gil Steinlauf, age 45, addressed a heartfelt letter to his Washington congregation on Monday. In the letter, the well-respected spiritual leader openly announced that he identifies as gay. Reflecting on his personal journey towards self-acceptance and inner peace, Rabbi Steinlauf shared his long-standing struggle with conflicting emotions regarding his sexuality. Ultimately, he stated that he firmly believed being honest with himself and others would enable him to become a stronger and more effective leader for his community. For many years, Rabbi Steinlauf fought to make sense of his sexual orientation, grappling with societal pressures and expectations, as well as his own sense of identity. Acknowledging the profound difficulties he faced in accepting his truth as a gay man, Rabbi Steinlauf's message serves as an inspirational testament to the importance of living authentically, regardless of the challenges one may encounter. One of the most heartwarming aspects of Rabbi Steinlauf's announcement is the unwavering support he has received from his wife, Batya, who is also a rabbi. Demonstrating a profound understanding and unconditional love, Batya has known about Gil's sexual identity for some time and continues to stand by his side as he courageously shares his truth with the world. The couple's strength and commitment to one another, despite the unique complexities of their individual journey, is an inspiring example of true partnership and devotion. Recognizing the significance of Steinlauf's disclosure, the congregation president issued a letter of support, in conjunction with the email disseminated to members. This display of solidarity not only underscores the community's commitment to inclusion and acceptance, but also serves as a beacon of hope for those who may be struggling with their own fears and uncertainties surrounding their sexual identity. By standing behind Rabbi Steinlauf, the congregation sends a powerful message about the importance of tolerance, love, and understanding in our increasingly diverse world. Rabbi Gil Steinlauf's decision to come out as gay sheds light on the many challenges faced by individuals in similar circumstances, particularly within the context of religious communities. As such, his courageous disclosure emphasizes the need for inclusivity, open dialogue, and acceptance within all aspects of society. In summary, Rabbi Gil Steinlauf's announcement about his sexual orientation serves as a transformative moment for not only him but for his community and countless others who may draw inspiration from his brave actions. By embracing his truth and committing to living authentically, Rabbi Steinlauf demonstrates that honesty, vulnerability, and acceptance are vital components of effective leadership. As he receives support from his wife and congregation, his story stands as an inspiring testament to the power of love and understanding in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Jessica Ennis-Hill Asks to Remove Her Name from Stand if Ched Evans Joins Sheffield United Once upon a time, there was a wonderful athlete named Jessica Ennis-Hill. She was a hero and a role model for many children because she competed in lots of sports and won lots of medals. She was so good that they named a stand at Sheffield United's football stadium after her. A stand is a place where people sit and cheer for their favourite team. But then, something happened that made Jessica very sad and upset. A football player named Ched Evans, who had done a very bad thing, might join the same team (Sheffield United). Ched Evans had been found guilty of a crime called \\"rape,\\" which is when someone forces another person to do something they don't want to. This is a very serious crime, and it's important for people to understand that it's wrong. Because Ched Evans might join the football team, Jessica didn't want her name to be part of the stadium anymore. She felt that if she allowed her name to stay there, it would be like saying what Ched Evans did was okay. But she knew it was not okay. So, she told the leaders of the football team that if they let Ched Evans join the team, they would have to take her name off the stand. Jessica showed great courage and stood up for what was right. It is important for everyone to recognize when something is wrong and to speak up against it. Jessica Ennis-Hill taught children and others a very important lesson about standing up for what they believe in. In the end, we can all learn from Jessica's brave decision and remember to treat others with respect, kindness, and love, and never to do anything that hurts or harms another person."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

HR files are human resource files, typically containing data related to employees, management, and various other workplace-related aspects. By analyzing the properties of the HR file, you can quickly determine its type, associated software, publisher, security status, and more. Let's break it down step by step: 1. Determining the Type of HR File: To figure out the type of HR file you have, first locate the file extension. File extensions are the short suffixes that appear after a period (.) in the file name. Common HR file types include but are not limited to CSV, XLSX, or PDF files. 2. Identifying the Associated Software Program: Once you know the file type, you can determine which software program is associated with your HR file. For instance, CSV files may open with Microsoft Excel, whereas PDF files usually correspond with Adobe Acrobat Reader. Alternative software options could include Google Sheets, LibreOffice, or WPS Office, among others. 3. Identifying the Publisher: To identify the publisher who created the HR file or the software associated with it, refer to the \\"properties\\" or \\"details\\" dialogue within your file explorer or the software itself. This information is typically found under the \\"File\\" menu or by right-clicking the file and selecting \\"Properties.\\" The publisher may be a company such as Microsoft, Google, or Adobe, or it might be an individual, depending on the file creator. 4. Assessing Security Safety Status: To determine the security safety status of your HR file, run anti-virus or anti-malware software on your computer to scan the file. Tools like Norton, McAfee, or Windows Defender can help ensure the file is safe to open. Additionally, ensure that the HR file was obtained from a trustworthy source, such as your own company or an established vendor, to reduce the likelihood of security threats. 5. Additional Useful Information: With the above steps, you should have a basic understanding of the HR file's type, associated software, publisher, and security status. Additional useful information could include: - File Size: This information can be found in the file's properties and can help identify whether the file is too large to send via email or other file-sharing platforms. - Creation Date and Last Modified Date: Also found in the file's properties, these details can be useful in tracking changes, ensuring you're working with the most recent version, or archiving purposes. - File Compatibility: If you need to share the HR file with others or open it on different devices, it's crucial to consider file compatibility with different operating systems and software programs. - Data Privacy: Confidential HR files should be protected with strong passwords or encryption to ensure sensitive employee data is safeguarded from unauthorized access. By following these steps, you can harness a wide array of information about your HR file, equipping you with the knowledge necessary to work effectively and securely within your company's human resource environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? 's just not very smart .","output":"The phrase 's just not very smart can be interpreted as having a negative connotation as it implies that the subject under discussion is lacking in intelligence or not displaying a high level of understanding. It is important to elaborate on some factors that could influence the perception of this statement, to better grasp its sentiment. 1. Context: The context in which this phrase is used greatly affects its interpretation. If the statement is made in response to a person's actions or decisions, it would be considered a criticism or negative comment towards that person's abilities. In contrast, if the phrase refers to an inanimate object or situation, like a poorly designed product, it may still be perceived as negative but directed towards the design or implementation rather than an individual's abilities. 2. Intent: The intent of the speaker is crucial in determining whether the phrase is positive or negative. If the intention behind the comment is to be constructive and encourage improvement, the sentiment could be interpreted as well-intentioned, although it still has a negative tone. If, however, the speaker's intent is to belittle or demean someone, the phrase is undeniably negative. 3. Tone: The way the phrase is spoken or written also impacts its perception. If said with a sarcastic or sharp tone, it might be viewed more harshly than if the tone were softer and more sympathetic. Additionally, the choice of words can also influence how the phrase is understood. For example, \\"not very smart\\" may seem more severe than saying \\"could use improvement.\\" 4. Relationship between the speaker and listener: The relationship between the speaker and the person being referred to in the statement can influence the interpretation of the phrase. If the speaker is a close friend or family member, the comment might be perceived less negatively than if it were made by an acquaintance or stranger. In some cases, close relationships may involve teasing or lighthearted criticism, which could slightly mitigate the perceived negativity.

Jeff Gerber lives in an average suburban neighborhood with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea, who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love. Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him.

Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? The more he reads, the more people I wonder what he will give to.","output":"A linguist might not consider the given sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically due to some issues with its structure and coherence. To analyze and provide a detailed explanation, let's break down the sentence and its components: 1. \\"The more he reads\\" - This is a comparative construction that sets up an expectation for another comparative element to follow. Linguistically speaking, it functions as an adverbial clause. 2. \\"the more people\\" - This is the second part of the comparative construction that should be compared to the first part; however, it does not fit seamlessly with the remainder of the sentence. 3. \\"I wonder\\" - This phrase functions as a standalone statement that introduces an inquiry or an expression of curiosity. 4. \\"what he will give to\\" - This is a relative clause that should describe the object or action in question. However, there is no clear antecedent to which \\"what\\" refers. Upon closer inspection, the sentence appears to combine two separate ideas: the relationship between the subject's reading habits and an inquiry about the person's gift-giving intent. The use of the comparative construction creates confusion, as it suggests a direct link between the two ideas that is not fully established by the sentence's structure. A clearer and more grammatically correct approach to convey the intended message might involve restructuring the sentence or splitting it into two separate sentences. For example: \\"As he reads more, I wonder how many people he will give to.\\" Or: \\"The more he reads, the more he learns. I wonder how many people he will give to.\\" Ultimately, a linguist would likely acknowledge that the original sentence's grammatical issues make it difficult to decipher its intended meaning and recommend revising it for coherence and clarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic -   Question: suppose less environmental regulations happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More effect. If there are less environmental regulations in place, it is likely that industries, power plants, and other emission sources will release more pollutants including sulfur oxides into the atmosphere. This is because, without strict regulations, companies might prioritize cost savings and operational efficiency over environmentally friendly practices. As a result, the use of high-sulfur coal, a more affordable energy source, may increase, leading to higher emissions of sulfur oxides. Now, let's consider how this increased emission of sulfur oxides would influence the subsequent effects mentioned in the process. 1. The increased release of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere will result in a greater quantity of these compounds being present in the air. 2. With more sulfur oxides present in the atmosphere, the likelihood of them reacting with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide also increases. 3. As the concentration of sulfur trioxide rises, it is more likely to react with water in the atmosphere, further increasing the formation of sulfuric acid. 4. The increased levels of sulfuric acid will directly contribute to increased acidity in rain, leading to more acid rain. Overall, less environmental regulation will likely have a significant and noticeable effect on the occurrence of acid rain, resulting in an increase in both its frequency and impact. This is because the absence of strict regulations allows for the burning of more high-sulfur coal, releasing more sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, facilitating the reactions that result in acid rain.

The Sinhalese (Sinhala: siNhl jaatiy Sinhala Jathiya, also known as Hela) are an Indo-Aryan-speaking ethnic group native to the island of Sri Lanka. They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 16.2 million. The Sinhalese identity is based on language, historical heritage and religion. The Sinhalese people speak the Sinhalese language, an Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly Theravada Buddhists, although a small percentage of Sinhalese follow branches of Christianity. Sinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of South Asia. Due to its proximity to South India, Sinhalese cuisine shows some influence, yet is in many ways quite distinct. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from colonial powers that were involved in Sri Lanka and by foreign traders. Rice, which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to Kerala cuisine, which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with Kerala. A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is Kiribath, meaning \\"Milk Rice.\\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \\"Mallung\\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated coconut and red onions. Coconut milk is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.  Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its spices. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special curry, accompanied by frikkadels (meatballs), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include roast beef and roast chicken. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.  The island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \\"main curry\\" of fish or chicken, as well as several other curries made with vegetables, lentils and even fruit curries. Side-dishes include pickles, chutneys and \\"sambols\\". The most famous of these is the coconut sambol, made of ground coconut mixed with chili peppers, dried Maldive fish and lime juice. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.","output":"This text is about the Sinhalese ethnic group native to the island of Sri Lanka.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A presenter is a person who introduces or hosts television programs (or segments thereof such as an infomercial advertiser) Nowadays, it is common for minor celebrities in other fields to take on this role, but some people have made their name solely within the field of presenting, particularly within children's television series, to become television personalities.  - A broadcast network is a group of radio stations, television stations, or other electronic media outlets, that form an agreement to air, or broadcast, content from a centralized source. For example, (U.S.) and (U.K.) are TV networks that provide programming for local TV station affiliates to air using signals that can be picked up by the home television sets of local viewers.  - Michele Merkin (born June 25, 1975) is an American model and television presenter.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979.  - The Next Best Thing : Who Is the Greatest Celebrity Impersonator ? is an American reality TV series competition of celebrity impersonators with a grand prize of  100,000 . It was hosted by Michele Merkin . The judges were Jeffrey Ross , Elon Gold and Lisa Ann Walter ; ultimately , the winner was chosen by viewer voting . The eight - episode series debuted May 30 , 2007 on the ABC television network and ended the same year .  - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.  - Elon Gold (born September 14, 1970) is an American comedian, television actor, writer and producer.  - Lisa Ann Walter is an American actress, comedian, writer and film producer. She has appeared in such films as the 1998 version of \\"The Parent Trap\\", \\"Bruce Almighty\\", \\"Shall We Dance\\", and \\"War of the Worlds\\". Walter also created and starred in the short-lived 19961997 sitcom, \\"Life's Work\\". She was a judge on ABC's reality television series \\"\\". She also won for her charity in a celebrity edition of \\"The Weakest Link\\".  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - A television station is a business, organisation or other enterprise, such as an amateur television (ATV) operator, that transmits (broadcasts) content over terrestrial television. A television transmission can occur via analog television signals or, more recently, via digital television signals. Broadcast television systems standards are set by the government, and these vary around the world. Television stations broadcasting over an analog system were typically limited to one television channel, but digital television enables broadcasting via subchannels as well. The term \\"television station\\" is normally applied to terrestrial television stations, and not to cable television or satellite television broadcasting.  - A television network is a telecommunications network for distribution of television program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many television stations or pay television providers. Until the mid-1980s, television programming in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of broadcast networks. Many early television networks (such as the BBC, NBC or CBC) evolved from earlier radio networks.  - There are two types of radio networks currently in use around the world: the one-to-many broadcast network commonly used for public information and mass media entertainment; and the two-way radio type used more commonly for public safety and public services such as police, fire, taxicabs, and delivery services. Cell Phones are able to send and receive simultaneously by using two different frequencies at the same time. Many of the same components and much of the same basic technology applies to all three.  - Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American high-concept comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk and stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly, and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.

Movie title: Quatermass 2 Movie plot: The movie opens with a car speeding along a dirt road. The woman driving (Jan Holden) is telling her boyfriend, Chris (Barry Lowe) to \\"Hold on, well get help soon, were coming to the main road.\\" He has a large dark blister on his face. He's delirious, grabs the steering wheel, and tries to run the car off the road. They enter a \\"T\\" intersection and nearly crash into the car Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Dunlevy) is driving. Quatermass gets out of his car and walks over to the other. He's very angry and shaken, but inquires about the burn on the man's face. The woman hands him some rock fragments and tells him they were responsible for the burn. She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed. He scolds Brand (William Franklyn) and Marsh (Bryan Forbes) for what he perceives as unauthorized use of the scanner.He tells Marsh and Brand that tomorrow none of them may have jobs. He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled. He outlines the project scope in front of a scale model--to build a colony on the moon. As he prepares to get in his car he points to the rocket ship on the launch pad and tells Brand, \\"Can you still bear to look at it? The sum total of our achievement up to now--one Rocket, crewless, untried.\\" He leaves for the rocket launch area. Brand returns to the radar room and notices more... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Quatermass 2\\" (also known as \\"Enemy from Space\\" in the American version), Professor Bernard Quatermass sabotages an alien conspiracy that has infiltrated the British government. The aliens are building secret facilities, disguised as a synthetic food plant, in Winterton Flats in order to distribute their meteorites containing the alien organisms. These organisms, when in contact with humans, create control nodes that allow the aliens to take over the minds of the infected individuals. Quatermass, along with Inspector Lomax, discovers that the alien conspiracy has deep roots within the government and many high-ranking officials have already been taken over by the alien organisms. In order to stop the imminent invasion, Quatermass infiltrates the alien facility and sabotages it. During the climax, Quatermass and his allies manage to cause a massive explosion, destroying the alien control center and killing the aliens in the process. This action ultimately puts an end to the alien conspiracy, saving humanity from their sinister plan of colonization and mind control."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Shaving over razor bumps will only irritate or tear them open, leaving them vulnerable to infection (and probably not removing much hair in the process). If you can, let the hair grow for a few days and see if it breaks out of the bumps on its own. It might itch, but breaking the bumps with your fingernails can lead to infection and scarring. Try to hold off as much as you can. Look for something that contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid, witch hazel, aloe, or any combination of these ingredients. Some of these products might come in a roller bottle that's designed to go directly on your skin, while others might require you to put the solution on a cotton ball and dab it on your skin.  If you don't know what to buy, call your local waxing salon and ask what they recommend to their clients. You can probably purchase the product there as well, or look around online. Apply the solution to your skin at least once per day, if not more. Aim to do it when you get out of the shower, before your skin has sweat or anything else on it. If you suspect that you have infected ingrown hairs, try using an antibacterial cream on them each day. Bacitracin, Neosporin, and Polysporin are all possible topical treatments. Retinoids, derived from Vitamin A, can help smooth over skin and reduce the appearance of scars or marks left by razor bumps.  You might need to see a doctor for a prescription.  Do not use Retin-A if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. It can cause severe birth defects.  Areas treated with Retin-A are more susceptible to sunburns. Cover up, or wear SPF 45 sunscreen.  Don't use Retin-A on any areas where you plan to wax in the future.— It can make the skin significantly weaker, leading to potential tearing during a waxing session. If your razor bumps persist for several weeks, and you haven't shaved again, consider booking an appointment with a dermatologist.","output":"Shaving over razor bumps can cause irritation and infection.

A:","output":"\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a classic American Christmas film directed by Frank Capra and released in 1946. The story takes place in the fictional town of Bedford Falls, which is situated in upstate New York. Although Bedford Falls is a fictional location, it is believed to have been inspired by real towns such as Seneca Falls in New York and Kalorama Falls in California. The film tells the story of George Bailey (played by James Stewart), a man who has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, sacrificing his own dreams and aspirations for the betterment of the town and its residents. As he faces a financial crisis, George becomes despondent and contemplates suicide on Christmas Eve. In response, his guardian angel, Clarence (played by Henry Travers), appears and shows George what life in Bedford Falls would have been like if he had never been born. The film transports its viewers through various settings within the town of Bedford Falls, including the Bailey family home, the Building and Loan Association office (where George works), the high school, the local pharmacy, the boardinghouse, and the Potter's Field cemetery. Many of these locations, such as the iconic Main Street with its shops and businesses, contribute to the quintessential small-town America vibe for which Bedford Falls is known. While the story unfolds primarily in the 1940s (the film's present day), it also takes us back in time to earlier moments in George's life, showcasing transformative events, and highlighting the influence George had on the people he encountered throughout the years. Though Bedford Falls is a fictional town, it was brought to life on a movie set at RKO’s Encino Ranch, near Los Angeles, California. The set, which was one of the largest built at the time, consisted of a main street, a working bank, a drugstore, a residential neighborhood, and other essential components that captured the essence of a small American town. The production team went to great lengths to ensure the town's authenticity in appearance and atmosphere, even importing 20 full-grown oak trees to line the streets. In summary, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" takes place in the fictional town of Bedford Falls, located in upstate New York. The story unfolds across various settings within the town and spans George Bailey's life from his childhood to adulthood. The film's production successfully brings Bedford Falls to life, providing viewers with an idyllic depiction of a small American town during the 1940s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kym also resents her sister's choice of her best friend to be her maid of honor instead of her. Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's drug addiction is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the rehearsal dinner, where Kym, amid toasts from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her twelve-step program. Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred years previously, which Kym retells at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her younger brother Ethan, who was left in her care one day; driving home from a nearby park, an intoxicated Kym had lost control of the car, driving over a bridge and into a lake, where her brother drowned. The day before the wedding, as Rachel, Kym, and the other bridesmaids are getting their hair done, Kym is approached by a man whom she knew from an earlier stint in rehab. He thanks her for the strength she gave him through a story about having been molested by an uncle and having cared for her sister, who was anorexic. Rachel, hearing this, storms out of the hair salon. The story turns out to be a lie, an apparent attempt by Kym to evade responsibility for her addiction. The tension between the sisters comes to a head later that night at their father's house, when Kym comes home. Rachel reveals she has never forgiven Kym for their brother's death, and suggests that Kym's rehab has been a hoax since she has been lying about the cause of her problems. Kym finally admits responsibility for Ethan's death and reveals that... Answer:","output":"Kym Buchman"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing and Frustrating Dining Experience Last Saturday, my family and I decided to try out the much-hyped \\"Gourmet Paradise\\" restaurant. We had heard a lot about their supposedly unique fusion cuisine and attentive service, so we eagerly went there expecting a memorable dining experience. Unfortunately, the entire evening was riddled with disappointments, ranging from the poor quality of food to the unprofessional service. First and foremost, getting a table at the restaurant was a challenge in and of itself. Despite having made a reservation a week in advance and receiving a confirmation, we arrived to find that there was no table available for us. The host seemed uninterested in helping us and just told us that it was a busy night and we would have to wait at least 20 minutes. Feeling frustrated, we reluctantly agreed to wait. Surprisingly, it took more than 30 minutes for our table to be ready. This was the first red flag. Once we were seated, the issues continued to pile up. Our server took an inordinate amount of time to attend to us. When they finally did, they seemed distracted and barely listened to our orders. We had to repeat ourselves on more than one occasion, and it was clear that their focus was elsewhere. This lack of attention made us feel unappreciated and undervalued as customers. Now, coming to the food. The menu offered an extensive variety of dishes, but the descriptions were quite vague, making it difficult for us to decipher and decide on our choices. We asked our server for recommendations, but they didn't seem to have much knowledge about the dishes either. Undeterred, we eventually decided on a few items that seemed interesting. It took nearly 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, which only added to our growing frustration. Moreover, the presentation of the dishes was underwhelming, which dampened our excitement even further. We had ordered the \\"Crispy Cauliflower and Truffle Oil\\" and the \\"Gourmet Sliders,\\" both of which failed to live up to their descriptions. The cauliflower was soggy and lacked the crispiness promised on the menu. The truffle oil was barely discernible, and the dish was overwhelmingly salty. The sliders were perhaps the biggest letdown of the evening. The buns were dry, and the patties seemed overcooked and lacked flavor. The accompanying sauce was cloyingly sweet and did not complement the sliders at all. Our main courses arrived and, sadly, fared no better. The \\"Signature Fusion Risotto\\" was mushy and lacked the creaminess we expected from a quality risotto. The \\"Miso-Glazed Lamb Chops\\" were undercooked, making some parts of the meat inedible. What was even more frustrating was that we had specifically requested the lamb chops to be cooked medium-well. Despite this, they were almost rare, and getting the attention of the staff to address this issue proved to be an exercise in futility. Dessert was our final hope for redemption, but alas, it was not to be. The \\"Chocolate Molten Lava Cake\\" was dense and dry, with just a teaspoon-sized portion of molten chocolate in the center. The accompanying raspberry sorbet tasted artificial and overly sweet. Throughout the evening, the service continued to be slow, inattentive, and unapologetic. Our water glasses were not refilled, and we were left without utensils for prolonged periods of time. When it was time to pay, our server made an error while splitting the bill and seemed annoyed when we pointed it out. In conclusion, our experience at \\"Gourmet Paradise\\" was nothing short of disappointing. The quality of the food was subpar, especially considering the high prices we were charged. The service severely detracted from our overall experience and only served to exacerbate our frustrations. As much as I wanted to enjoy this restaurant, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to others or plan a return visit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Philippine authorities warn of flash floods and landslides. The typhoon comes almost a year after a storm killed more than 1,200 people on Mindanao.","output":"Title: Typhoon Bopha on the Move: Mindanao in Its Path Typhoon Bopha, closely monitored as it forged a path across the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, has slightly weakened early Tuesday, producing a solitary light at the end of the tunnel for those bracing against its wrath. However, despite the tiny dip in the intensity, the storm continues to exhibit a substantial threat, with Philippine authorities on red alert for possible flash floods and landslides. Bopha, known locally as 'Pablo', initially made landfall on the eastern coast of Mindanao, heralding its arrival with a vengeance, bringing torrential rains and gusty winds, displaying a shocking reminder of the sheer force of nature. The rapid movement of Bopha, combined with its considerable size, has raised significant concerns about the potential for widespread devastation. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has been particularly vigilant in giving updates about Bopha's trajectory and potential impacts. The organization has been warning upland communities and those residing near river systems about the increased likelihood of flash floods and landslides due to the relentless rain brought about by the typhoon. The agency has also advised fishermen and those with small boats not to venture into the eastern seaboards of Visayas and Mindanao where sea conditions would be rough to very rough. Despite the slightly diminished strength, the Philippines has not taken this storm lightly. Schools and offices have been shut down and thousands of people have been shifted to safer zones to minimize potential casualties. These precautionary measures are a reflection of lessons learned from previous disastrous typhoons.  This latest meteorological monstrosity comes almost a year after the country still reeling from the devastating impact of another typhoon that claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people on Mindanao. Typhoon Washi, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Sendong, wrought unparalleled havoc, washing away entire villages and stunning officials with its overnight death toll that jumped into the thousands in 2011. The residents who endured the brunt of Typhoon Washi still bear the scars of the incident. Thus, the arrival of Typhoon Bopha has inevitably resurfaced the heart-rending memories of the tragic event that befell Mindanao last year. While Bopha may have slightly weakened as it continues to traverse across Mindanao, it is imperative for the public to remember that it remains a highly dangerous weather system. The Philippine government, continuing its proactive stance amidst the impending calamity, is exerting all efforts to mitigate the impact of the storm and safeguard the lives and properties of its citizens. The blend of social memory and ongoing threat from Typhoon Bopha serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of areas in the path of these natural disasters. The cycle of perennial typhoons leaves a question hanging in the air: how can the Philippines, and other nations alike in the Pacific ring of fire, build resilience against these natural disasters? With a collective national memory still wounded from the tragedy of Typhoon Washi, it is hoped that Typhoon Bopha’s passage will be less destructive. Observers worldwide continue to monitor the situation closely, their thoughts and prayers with those in the direct path of the storm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it.

Please answer the following question: This article: St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs. contains an answer for the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation?, what is it ?

In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States.  He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railroad workers to find out his whereabouts.

Plot title: Apollo 18 Movie plot: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

The first is the above-mentioned economic inequality which will tend to result in poorer performance when taking the average for America. The second is that many countries have put considerable effort into improving their education systems and hence it is worth considering that America's decline is also due to the improvement of others. The third is the matter of the measures-- do they, in fact, present an accurate picture of the situation? I am not claiming that the data is bad. I am merely raising a reasonable concern about how accurate our picture of education is at this time. Another stock claim is that American students are doing badly on standardized tests. While there is clearly value in assessment, it is reasonable to consider whether or not such tests are a proper and adequate measure of education. It is also worth considering whether the puzzle with these tests is itself causing damage to education. That is, as teachers teach for the test and students learn for the test, it might be the case that what is being taught is not what should be taught and what is being learned is not what should be learned. Question: The passage is written mainly to  _  . Answer: The answer is:","output":"The passage is written mainly to address common claims and concerns about the American education system and to encourage a more nuanced evaluation of its performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  A star forms - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula Answer:","output":"The final step of the process described is the formation of a white dwarf. After the star sheds its outer layers and becomes a nebula, the core that remains is composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. This dense core with no nuclear reactions occurring is called a white dwarf. As a white dwarf, the star no longer participates in nuclear fusion and instead relies on the electron degeneracy pressure to support it against gravitational collapse. Since the star does not have enough mass to further collapse into a neutron star or a black hole, it gradually cools down over a long period of time, radiating its remaining heat into space. Since white dwarfs are compact and incredibly dense, they are extremely hot when they first form. Their surface temperatures can reach up to 100,000 Kelvin. Over time, this temperature slowly decreases, and as it cools, the white dwarf's brightness also fades. This cooling process takes billions of years, and the white dwarf eventually becomes a black dwarf - a theoretical, cold, and non-luminous object that is no longer emitting visible light. However, it is important to note that the universe is currently not old enough for any white dwarfs to have cooled down to the black dwarf stage, so black dwarfs remain a theoretical concept at this point in time. In summary, the final step in the process of a star with insufficient mass to become a neutron star is the formation of a white dwarf, which eventually cools down and fades over billions of years, and is theorized to ultimately become a black dwarf."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After meeting Sir Henry, Holmes remembers that he is going to be away on another case when Sir Henry returns to Baskerville Hall. Holmes puts Watson in charge of watching over Sir Henry. A tarantula attacks Sir Henry briefly in London; Holmes suspects foul play. Before he leaves, Holmes reminds Watson not to let Sir Henry go out onto the moor after dark. On the way to Baskerville Hall, the coach driver, Perkins (Sam Kydd), warns that a convict named Selden (Michael Mulcaster) has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison two days ago. Watson remembers the case: Selden was convicted of murdering a number of street women; due to his being found insane, he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of hanging. At Baskerville Hall, Watson and Sir Henry learn from the butler, Barrymore (John Le Mesurier), that one of the two paintings of Sir Hugo was stolen several months ago. Watson then inquires Barrymore about further details of Sir Charles's death since Barrymore was the first to discover the body. Barrymore explains that he was on his way to warn Dr. Mortimer of Sir Charles's disappearance and then found the body by chance.

Can you tell me the answer to who wrote the song i can't live if living is without you??","output":"\\"I Can't Live if Living Is Without You,\\" more commonly known as \\"Without You,\\" was written by British musicians Pete Ham and Tom Evans, who were both members of the rock band Badfinger. The song was originally featured on their 1970 album, \\"No Dice,\\" which was the band's second studio album. It is considered one of the band's most popular and enduring hits. The song was written during a period of turmoil for the band, as they struggled with management and financial issues. However, it was through these struggles that Ham and Evans were able to create such an emotional and relatable song. The lyrics of \\"Without You\\" convey feelings of loss, heartbreak, and the inability to go on without a loved one, a poignant message that has resonated with audiences over the decades. Despite being written and recorded by Badfinger, it was a cover by Harry Nilsson in 1971 that brought the song to new heights of popularity. Nilsson's version of \\"Without You\\" became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and was also a success in other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Nilsson's cover was characterized by his powerful and emotive vocal performance, accompanied by a lush arrangement, enhancing the emotional depth of the song. Over the years, several other artists have also covered \\"Without You,\\" including Mariah Carey in 1994, who achieved significant commercial success with her version of the song. Carey's rendition followed the same emotional and musical formula as Nilsson's cover, further solidifying the song's status as a timeless classic. The legacy of \\"Without You\\" is marked not only by its continued popularity among listeners but also by its impact on the songwriters themselves. Unfortunately, both Pete Ham and Tom Evans faced personal struggles that ultimately led to their untimely deaths. Nevertheless, their powerful composition lives on as a testament to their songwriting skills and has become a cherished part of popular music history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nuclear energy control is associated with maintaining balance in the nuclear fission process, which uses the generated heat to produce steam, turning steam turbines and subsequently generators. In 2004, nuclear energy accounted for about 6.5% of the world's total energy consumption and 15.7% of electricity. It was first produced by Enrico Fermi in 1934 in one of the University of Chicago laboratories. This happened while his team was bombarding uranium nuclei with neutrons. According to the World Nuclear Association's forecast, on average, one nuclear power plant will be launched every five days in 2015. The nuclear fission that takes place in a reactor is only part of a nuclear cycle. The most important issue raised by opponents of nuclear energy is the environmental safety of nuclear power plants because even the slightest mistake can lead to catastrophes like the Chernobyl disaster.

Alsace With the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. Alsace was united with the other Alemanni east of the Rhine into the stem duchy of Swabia.

Article: An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Aircraft carriers have evolved from converted cruisers to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. Now answer this question: What type of flight decks are aircraft carriers equipped with?","output":"Aircraft carriers are equipped with full-length flight decks. These flight decks not only facilitate the takeoff and landing of aircraft but also provide storage and maintenance facilities. The structure and design of these decks are highly imperative to the operational efficiency of an aircraft carrier. It must be resistant to heat, as well as durable enough to withstand the damage of continuous takeoffs and landings.  The full-length flight deck is wider in area than any deck on a normal ship. This is because it needs to accommodate the large wingspan of military aircraft. The deck is designed to help increase the lift of planes during takeoff, providing a runway that slopes down toward the bow of the ship.  The deck needs to be long enough to provide a safe runway for aircraft to land. As technology has advanced, the creation of arresting wires and tailhooks on aircraft have helped decrease the runway length needed for landings, but it is still a critical factor. Aircraft use the arresting wires to decelerate upon touchdown on the deck, reducing the risk of running off the deck's end.  The flight deck is usually painted with specific markings to guide the pilots during landing and takeoff, and it is usually equipped with elevators to transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar deck below where maintenance and repairs of the aircraft, as well as refueling, take place. Beneath the flight deck, facilities exist for arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. This highly organized infrastructure system includes ammunition depots, fueling lines, hangars for storing aircraft when not in use or needing maintenance, and workshops for repairing damaged aircraft or conducting routine maintenance work. In more modern and advanced carriers, the flight deck has been equipped with catapult systems, which use a steam-powered piston or electromagnetic power to launch aircraft from the deck at high speeds, reducing the need for a long runway. Hence, the flight deck of an aircraft carrier is an intricate and integral component, designed to efficiently manage the operations of various types of aircraft, from fighter planes and strike aircraft to helicopters. It is a masterful combination of technology, engineering, architecture, and planning - the foundation of an aircraft carrier's ability to project air power worldwide."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please answer the following question: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

She wasn't sure if it was an infection or just a simple toothache, but she had heard some alarming stories about tooth infections and was concerned about the potential pain. Step 1: Understand Maria's situation As Maria is experiencing tooth discomfort, it is important to empathize with her feelings and concerns. This will help create an accurate description of her situation and make her feel more understood. Step 2: Research about tooth infections To provide accurate information to both Maria and Tanya, it is essential to gather information on tooth infections, including causes, symptoms, and severity of pain. This is crucial for ensuring a well-informed conversation. Step 3: Compare tooth infection pain and a simple toothache Maria is unsure whether she has a tooth infection or a simple toothache, so comparing the two will help her understand the differences in pain and other symptoms. This will enable Maria to gauge her own situation and identify whether her discomfort might be a tooth infection or something less severe. So, after thorough research, Tanya told Maria that a tooth infection could indeed be quite painful, as it happens when bacteria invade the dental pulp (soft tissue inside the tooth). This can lead to inflammation and pressure on the nerves, causing pain. In some cases, the pain could be severe and radiate to the surrounding areas like the jaw and ears. The level of pain, however, can vary from person to person and depends on the severity of the infection. In contrast, a simple toothache can result from various reasons, such as tooth sensitivity, a small cavity, or even food particles lodged between the teeth. Generally, toothaches tend to be less severe than infections but might still cause discomfort. Additionally, Tanya advised Maria to visit a dentist as soon as possible to get an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. Ignoring a tooth infection could escalate the issue, leading to more pain and potential complications like an abscess or, in some situations, even spread the infection to other parts of the body.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: ants crawling on a tree","output":"In the given sentence \\"ants crawling on a tree,\\" the most important words can be analyzed based on their function and relevance to the overall meaning. Here is the breakdown of the significance of each word in the sentence: 1. \\"ants\\": This word is the subject of the sentence and represents the core focus of the sentence's meaning. By referring to \\"ants,\\" it specifies a particular type of insects that we are discussing, and the rest of the sentence provides more information about those ants. Hence, \\"ants\\" is an important word in this sentence because it determines the main topic being discussed. 2. \\"crawling\\": This word is the verb in the sentence, and it's essential because it describes the action that the ants are performing. The verb gives life to the sentence and helps us understand what the ants are doing in this situation. Without the verb \\"crawling,\\" the sentence would lack action, and the meaning would be incomplete or unclear. Thus, \\"crawling\\" is crucial for expressing the activity the ants are engaged in, making it a significant word in the sentence. 3. \\"on\\": This is a preposition in the sentence that serves to connect the subject (ants) to another element (tree) and indicates the spatial relationship between them. The word \\"on\\" is important because it helps us understand that the ants are not just near the tree, but they are specifically on it. This preposition fortifies the image of ants moving about on the surface of the tree and plays a vital role in establishing the setting and describing the spatial relationship between the ants and the tree. 4. \\"a tree\\": Finally, \\"a tree\\" is an indispensable part of the sentence, as it constitutes the object which is tied to the subject (ants) through the preposition \\"on.\\" This phrase provides essential context to inform us where the ants are crawling. Without the mention of a tree, there would be missing information, and the sentence wouldn't convey a complete scenario. The presence of the object \\"a tree\\" completes the meaning of the sentence. So, in conclusion, the most important words in the sentence \\"ants crawling on a tree\\" are \\"ants\\", \\"crawling\\", \\"on\\", and \\"a tree.\\" Each word plays a crucial role in expressing the main idea of the sentence and creating a clear picture of the scene being described."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence is a critique and presents the subject matter - considered here as a \\"point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama\\" - in a harshly derogatory light.  Firstly, the reference to \\"bowel movements\\" is a particularly unflattering allegory. The use of such bodily function tends to denote something unpleasant, disgusting, or of low quality, and in this context, it implies that the speaker perceives the drama as less appealing than even a physical waste product. This is a very strong negative sentiment as it places the drama at a very low stratum of worth, almost as the bottommost undesirable product. The second part of the sentence points out that the drama is a \\"long-on-the-shelf, point-and-shoot exercise\\", which gives an impression of the drama being outdated, overused, or unimaginative. It suggests that the drama is cliche, unoriginal, and following a formulaic approach. It could also imply that the drama has been sitting \\"on the shelf\\" for a long time - it's not fresh, new, or exciting. This can be perceived as negative as it paints a picture of stagnation and lack of creativity or evolution. The term \\"gimmicky crime drama\\" further reinforces the negative sentiment. The word 'gimmicky' is often used to define something that is intended to attract attention, but lacks substance, value, or sincerity. In this context, it suggests that the crime drama relies on shallow tricks or tactics to gain viewership, but fails to deliver meaningful content or narrative. All these elements come together to strongly indicate that the speaker has a very negative opinion about the drama. They are criticizing the drama's lack of originality, over-reliance on worn-out tactics, and an overall lack of quality that puts it below even the most base bodily function. Their sentiment is one of strong dissatisfaction and disappointment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sheardown had Alzheimer's and suffered from colon and prostate cancer, said Robin Sheardown, who described his father as his best friend. John Sheardown died Sunday night at a hospital in Ottawa, Canada. \\"He was a very humble man and a real Canadian hero,\\" his son told CNN. John Sheardown played a key role in what has become known as the \\"Canadian Caper,\\" a covert operation by the Canadian government and the CIA to rescue six American diplomats who eluded capture during the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The episode was made famous again this year by the release of the hit movie \\"Argo,\\" loosely based on the real-life drama. The film, however, left out Sheardown's contributions. Sheardown was an immigration officer at the Canadian Embassy in Tehran when students and militants stormed the U.S. Embassy there on November 4, 1979, taking more than 50 Americans hostage. Just half a dozen evaded capture. Sheardown and Ken Taylor, the Canadian ambassador to Iran, hid those six envoys in their homes, protecting them until they could be spirited out of the country with Canadian passports in late January 1980. \\"John Sheardown remained a very humble man, always willing to stay in the shadow of others, and the people of Windsor remain extremely proud of his diplomatic intervention and career accomplishments,\\" read a proclamation that declared November 10, 2012, \\"John Sheardown Day\\" in the city of Windsor, in Ontario, Canada.

Here is a news article: Judge rules lottery ticket stripper must face trial, but not for being naked      A 27-year-old man accused of stripping off his clothes after being denied a Powerball lottery ticket in February must face Lehigh County Court on robbery charges, a district judge ruled Friday.      Miguel M. Valera, however, won't have to face charges of being naked.      District Judge David M. Howells Jr. ruled Valera must face trial on more than a dozen charges for the bizarre chain of events that began with Valera asking for a lottery ticket and ended with him being chased down the street by two men, one swinging a baseball bat.      Valera allegedly went to the convenience store Feb. 20, hours after lottery machines had closed for the night, police said. The Powerball drawing that night was for a 425 million jackpot.      An employee at the Quick Mart, 707 N. Seventh St., reported to Allentown police that Valera undressed after being told he couldn't get a ticket, according to court records.      The employee told police Valera started walking around the store naked, holding his penis, and throwing candy and other items around, according to court records. The employee called police and Valera put on his clothes, ran out and went to another convenience store across the street, police said.      That Quick Mart employee did not show up to testify in court and an open lewdness charge against Valera was withdrawn.      Mohmmad Sarwar, an employee at the second convenience store, Pace Mart at 640 N. Seventh St., testified Friday that Valera stood in line behind another customer. Once Sarwar opened the cash register, Valera demanded he hand over everything behind the counter, Sarwar testified.      Another Pace Mart employee grabbed a baseball bat and chased Valera out of the store, he testified. Valera knocked down some items on his way out, police said.      Valera jumped into a car that was at the gasoline pumps and tried to drive off, but the car's owner pulled him out, Allentown police officer Kyle Pammer testified. The owner and the store employee with the baseball bat chased Valera down the street and into the path of arriving police officers, he testified.      Sarwar was asked if Valera appeared drunk when he came into his store.      \\"I'm not a doctor,\\" he answered. \\"I'm not God.\\"      Valera is charged with more than a dozen offenses, including robbery of a motor vehicle, theft, receiving stolen property, public drunkenness, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct.      — Manuel Gamiz ||||| The 25 tickets, all purchased at a York corner grocery store, had to be redeemed by March 13      Some 25 winning lottery tickets were sold at Zhou Grocery on South Queen Street in York. The tickets were thrown away mistakenly by the man who purchased them, a store employee said. (Mike Argento -- Daily Record/Sunday News)      The guy, it goes without saying, was pretty upset.      \\"Wouldn't you be,\\" said Wendy Hinton, who works at Zhou Grocery on South Queen Street in York.      On March 13, 2013, she sold 25 Quinto tickets - numbers 4-3-4-1-8 - to one of her regular customers, a man who, at the time, lived a couple of blocks from the corner store. She remembered because he played the same numbers every day - their significance, not known - and always bought a bunch of tickets with the same numbers - sometimes 20, other times 25 - among his daily lottery purchases that totaled about 100 a day.      Shortly after the drawing, she said, the man checked the numbers, but must have misread them and threw the tickets in the trash.      The 25 tickets were worth 50,000 each - 1.25 million total.      \\"He was mad,\\" Hinton said of the day he found out that he threw away more than a million dollars. \\"He was so mad he played 400 that day.\\"      It had been a mystery what happened to the tickets. The Pennsylvania Lottery put out a news release back in February, warning whoever held the tickets that they had until March 13 to cash them in, figuring that the person may have tucked them away in a kitchen junk drawer or had them in a wallet or pocketbook and hadn't bothered to check them.      The truth was slightly different.      \\"Oh, no,\\" lottery spokeswoman Lauren Bottaro said. \\"Wow.\\"      Bottaro said the lottery hates for tickets to go unclaimed and said this instance emphasizes the importance of players checking their tickets.      The 1.25 million jackpot will now remain in the state Lottery Fund.      Lottery players are usually pretty diligent about checking their tickets. Bottaro said Unclaimed tickets are very rare, composing maybe 1 percent of the number of tickets sold in the state.      \\"We do what we can\\" to notify winners, Bottaro said. \\"But sometimes, it's just not enough.\\"      Read the original report.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Jess Collins, born Burgess Franklin Collins on the 6th of August 1923, was an iconic American visual artist who revolutionized the field of art with his distinctive style. Born in Long Beach, California, Collins' upbringing and surroundings would play significant roles in shaping his artistic perspective and eventually his oeuvre as a whole. Despite being primarily known by his sobriquet, 'Jess,' he was born as Burgess Franklin Collins, a name that harks back to a much diverse and profound life story. Although known publicly as Jess Collins and widely accepted that way, he preferred to sign his work simply as 'Jess.' His humility, reflected in his preference for his mononym, was emblematic of the persona he created as an artist - one that transcended beyond the mundane conventions of titles and names. Jess began his adventure in the realm of visual art after receiving comprehensive training from the prestigious San Francisco Art Institute, one of the nation's oldest contemporary art schools. This phase of his life, marked by intense learning and honing his craft, was instrumental in moulding Jess into the artist that he eventually became. The rigorous curriculum and the vibrant artistic milieu of the institute allowed Jess to fully explore his potential and widen his cognitive horizon. Owing to his intense training, Jess commandeered a reputation in visual arts and became synonymous with uniqueness and creativity in the field. The oeuvre of his work, distinguished by a characteristic palette, reminisces their creator's undeniable presence in the art world throughout his lifetime. This was also reflected by the background colour #6495ED often seen in his works, which his peers associated with his style. Deeply patriotic, as an American national, Jess infused his works with an unmistakable American sensibility that bore testament to his strong bond with his country. His identity as an American artist not only influenced his artistic style but also the subject matter of his artworks. However, the great life of Jess came to an end on 2nd January 2004. His death marked the end of an era of unbridled creativity and unparalleled innovation in visual arts. Despite his physical absence, his legacy continues to thrive, inspiring many artists and art enthusiasts. His unique contributions to visual arts have firmly established him in the pantheon of great American artists. Therefore, from humble beginnings in Long Beach, California, to becoming one of the most renowned allies of visual arts, Jess' journey has become a tale of inspiration for many. His life, characterized by relentless exploration and creative ignition, manifests itself in his array of timeless artworks. His influence in the field of visual art remains indomitable, and his legacy continues to mark the artistic landscape, making him one of the most distinguished personalities in American art history."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Face washes and topical treatments containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, or resorcinol acid are all effective acne-fighters and are available over-the-counter. You may find products targeted specifically at treating body acne, which may be more effective than products meant to be used on your face. Just make sure you don't forget and use the body product on the delicate skin of your face or the front of your neck. Retinoid creams can help to unclog your pores and eliminate acne on your neck, but you will need to get a prescription from your doctor or dermatologist. Your doctor may prescribe a prescription-strength topical antibiotic, such as clindamycin, to apply to your neck, which kills acne-causing bacteria. It may also reduce redness. You will need to apply it twice daily and combine it with benzoyl peroxide, as this prevents the bacteria from becoming immune to the antibiotic. Oral contraceptives can help to reduce acne in some women, but only if the acne is related to shifts in your hormones. Keep in mind that oral contraceptives have side effects and they should not be used if you are planning to become pregnant. If your dermatologist determines that the acne on the back of your neck is a nodular or cystic lesion, your doctor may decide to inject the lesion directly with a steroid. This can quickly reduce swelling and heal the acne. It may also reduce scarring. Side effects of this treatment include thinning of the skin, increased sensitivity to light, and may temporarily case the fat under your skin to atrophy, giving the area a \\"sunken\\" appearance. Isotretinoin is a strong medicine that should only be used if other methods of controlling acne fail to work. Isotretinoin can clear up severe acne in a couple of months, but it also has some severe risks including:  Ulcerative colitis Liver damage Inflammatory bowel disease Depression Bone changes Severe birth defects Laser treatments can also help to get rid of acne by reducing the size of oil glands and making them less active as well. Some forms of laser therapy also use topical medicine to make the laser more effective. Keep in mind that you will need multiple treatments in order for laser therapy to work. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses various treatments for acne, including over-the-counter products containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, and resorcinol acid.

A character in the sitcom Friends, or a provisioner of candles and soaps?","output":"Okay, let's break this down like we're talking to a five-year-old: There are two parts to this question - one part is about a character in the TV show called \\"Friends,\\" and the other part is about a person who makes or sells candles and soaps. Now, a character means someone you see in a story or on TV, like in a show or a movie. For example, Ariel in The Little Mermaid or Woody in Toy Story. So in this case, we are talking about a character from the show called \\"Friends.\\" \\"Friends\\" is a TV show that's for grown-ups, and it's about a group of friends who live in New York City. They have lots of fun and adventures together. But right now, we don't know which character from the show the question wants us to talk about. The other part of the question is about a person who provides candles and soaps. Candles are those things that grown-ups light up when it's dark or for a nice smell, and soaps are what we use to wash our hands or take a bath. A provisioner is a person who makes or sells these things, like candles and soaps. But again, we don't know who specifically the question is referring to. So this question is a bit confusing because it's not clear which character from Friends or which specific provisioner of candles and soaps we should be talking about.

In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - The Neckar is a river in Germany, mainly flowing through the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, with a short section through Hesse.

Q:Information:  - The Proterozoic is a geological eon representing the time just before the proliferation of complex life on Earth. The name Proterozoic comes from Greek and means \\"earlier life\\", the Greek root protero-,means \\"former, earlier\\" and zoic-, means \\"animal, living being\\". The Proterozoic Eon extended from to (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the Precambrian Supereon. It is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic. The well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; several glaciations, which produced the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period in the late Neoproterozoic Era; and the Ediacaran Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth.  - Laurentia or the North American Craton is a large continental craton that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent. Many times in its past, Laurentia has been a separate continent as it is now in the form of North America, although originally it also included the cratonic areas of Greenland and also the northwestern part of Scotland, known as the Hebridean Terrane. During other times in its past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and supercontinents and itself consists of many smaller terranes assembled on a network of Early Proterozoic orogenic belts. Small microcontinents and oceanic islands collided with and sutured onto the ever-growing Laurentia, and together formed the stable Precambrian craton seen today.  - Baltica was a late-Proterozoic, early-Palaeozoic continent that now includes the East European craton of northwestern Eurasia. Baltica was created as an entity not earlier than 1.8 billion years ago. Before this time, the three segments/continents that now compose the East European craton were in different places on the globe. Baltica existed on a tectonic plate called the Baltic Plate.  - Nena was an ancient minor supercontinent that consisted of the cratons of Arctica , Baltica , and East Antarctica . Nena formed about 1.8 billion years ago but became part of the global supercontinent Columbia around 1.1 billions of years ago .  - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain.  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The Precambrian (or Pre-Cambrian, sometimes abbreviated p) is the earliest period of Earth's history, set before the current Phanerozoic Eon. The Precambrian (colored green on the right) is a supereon that is subdivided into three eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic) of the geologic time scale. It spans from the formation of Earth about 4.567 billion years ago (Ga) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about million years ago (Ma), when hard-shelled creatures first appeared in abundance. The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the Cambrian, the first period of the Phanerozoic eon, which is named after Cambria, the Latinised name for Wales, where rocks from this age were first studied. The Precambrian accounts for 89% of geologic time.    'nena ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'temporal range start'?  Choices: - paleoproterozoic  - precambrian  - tithonian A:","output":"Nena is related to the object entity \\"Paleoproterozoic\\" through the relation of \\"temporal range start\\". Nena, the ancient minor supercontinent, which included the cratons of Arctica, Baltica, and East Antarctica, formed about 1.8 billion years ago, during the Paleoproterozoic Era. This Paleoproterozoic Era is one of three subdivisions of the Proterozoic Eon, which belongs to the Precambrian Supereon, the early part of Earth's history, encompassing around 89% of geological time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian reform leader Mohamed ElBaradei on Saturday ended his bid for president after criticizing the interim military government for its failure to bring about \\"a real democratic system.\\"      The Nobel laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency accused the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of mismanaging the interim period that followed the January 25th revolution that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak.      The 69-year-old says he will continue to work with the youth to help fulfill the nation's hope of freedom, human dignity and social justice.      \\"Unfortunately, the transition period has been handled in the worst way ever,\\" he said in a video posted his YouTube channel. \\"We haven't seen any changes in the state media, the state media is like it was before, a mouthpiece for the ruling regime and the judicial system has a lot of flaws and needs cleansing.\\"      ElBaradei also threw harsh criticism at the army's dealing with protesters since they took over.      \\"And what is worse is how we have seen, young men being treated, people being killed and tortured and when we hear about virginity tests. These are shameful things, really shameful,\\" he said.      ElBaradei was at one point considered a frontrunner in the race, but recent victories in local elections by Islamist groups tested the viability of his candidacy.      This announcement comes as Egypt prepares for the anniversary of last year's revolution. A power struggle has developed between the newly elected parliament dominated by Islamists and the ruling generals.      Many, including ElBaradei, fear that the military will not give up power despite the military council saying that they will transfer it after the presidential election.      According to his campaign, ElBaradei sees chaos and mismanagement in the interim military government, which \\"pushes the nation away from the goals of the revolution.\\"      Despite being a populist, ElBaradei didn't have much of a chance to actually win the presidency, said the prominent Egyptian political analyst and journalist Hisham Kassem.      \\"I always thought ElBaradei was too ethical for politics,\\" he says. \\"He is someone who has played a major role in bringing about the uprising but I wasn't sure he would have made it as president.\\"      One of ElBaradei's political rivals in the presidential race, former Arab League chief Amr Moussa, said he regretted ElBaradei's decision.      Moussa's campaign told CNN that the candidate commended the role ElBaradei played in the changes Egypt has seen in past months, and hopes that he will continue his efforts to rebuild the country.      Other presidential candidates will want to lure ElBaradei's supporters, but Kassem doesn't believe a single candidate will benefit.      \\"I think the votes will get scattered because it is difficult to see a runner-up for ElBaradei politically,\\" he said. \\"ElBaradei being secular could help Amr Moussa but his ties to the old regime will turn many off to him as being a candidate.\\"      Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report for CNN. |||||       REPORTING FROM CAIRO -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed ElBaradei has dropped out of the race for the Egyptian presidency in protest over the slow pace by the nation’s military rulers to allow democracy to take hold after a year of revolution and political upheaval.      ElBaradei’s announcement Saturday is a strategic and emotional blow to young liberal and secular activists who had hoped the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency would lead the country toward democratic reform to replace the corrupt legacy of deposed President Hosni Mubarak.      \\"My conscience does not permit me to run for the presidency or any other official position unless it is within a democratic framework,\\" said ElBaradei in a statement. He added that the ruling military council has thwarted civil liberties and taken control of Egypt “as if no revolution took place and no regime has fallen.”      ElBaradei has been a frequent critic of the military, often posting Twitter missives against the generals for deadly crackdowns on protesters and smothering of dissent. When he returned to his native Egypt in 2010, after years of living abroad, ElBaradei led the National Front for Change and was viewed as a fresh, uncorrupted voice.      But he lacked charisma and never appeared comfortable rallying the masses. He spent much of his time organizing behind the scenes, especially with the young social media activists who sparked the uprising that led to Mubarak’s overthrow.      His chances of winning presidential elections -– slated for June –- had dimmed in recent weeks. ElBaradei was considered an outsider and did not have the stature of entrenched Islamist parties, most notably the Muslim Brotherhood, the country’s dominant political force.      The Brotherhood, which appears to have won about 45% of the seats in the new Parliament, regards ElBaradei as too liberal for the emerging political Islam it envisions for Egypt. ElBaradei’s brand of secular, Western-style democracy resonated with the youth and intellectuals in Tahrir Square but played less well in the rural regions and provinces dominated by the Islamists.

He was a popular and important leader who helped change things in Egypt, but he didn't think he could be president without the country becoming more fair and democratic.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Does word \\"feeling\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? He lost all feeling in his arm. He had terrible feelings of guilt.","output":"No, the word \\"feeling\\" has different meanings in the two sentences. In the first sentence, when he lost all feeling in his arm, it means he could not sense anything with his arm, like touch or pain. Imagine if your hand fell asleep, and you couldn't feel if someone touched it. In the second sentence, terrible feelings of guilt mean that he had strong emotions of feeling bad or sorry for something he did. It's like when you accidentally break your sister's toy and feel really bad about it."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in Dutch, generate a new Dutch sentence by performing small changes on the sentence. Here, make sure that the changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input. And the generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility, that is to have reasonable probability of it being true. Q: Je bent dwaas om een hoofd te schilderen in een kantoor. A:","output":"Part #1: Sentence in Dutch Usage: Je bent dwaas om een hoofd te schilderen in een kantoor.  The given sentence is in the Dutch language: \\"Je bent dwaas om een hoofd te schilderen in een kantoor.\\" which translates to \\"You are foolish to paint a head in an office.\\" Part #2: Semantically related changes Usage: Het is onverstandig om een portret te schilderen in een kantoor. This new Dutch sentence is semantically related to the original sentence: \\"Het is onverstandig om een portret te schilderen in een kantoor.\\" which translates to \\"It is unwise to paint a portrait in an office.\\" Here, \\"dwaas\\" (foolish) is replaced with \\"onverstandig\\" (unwise) and \\"hoofd\\" (head) is replaced with \\"portret\\" (portrait), both conveying similar meanings. Part #3: Syntactically similar Usage: Het is onverstandig om een portret te schilderen in een kantoor. The new sentence has a similar syntax to the original sentence; it still contains a subject (painting a portrait), action (painting), and location (in an office) while using the same grammatical structure. Part #4: High commonsense plausibility Usage: Het is onverstandig om een portret te schilderen in een kantoor. This sentence has a higher commonsense plausibility since painting a portrait in an office can be considered unwise or impractical due to various reasons such as lack of suitable space, risk of damaging office equipment, or being an inefficient use of time during work hours, which makes it more reasonable to believe as true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was sent to prison, where he committed suicide. Samantha Finley (Erin Marie Hogan), her older brother Thomas (Shane Van Dyke), and their mother Ellen (Fia Perera) believe that Ellen has been making contact with her deceased husband, David. Soon the family claims that a demon is haunting them. At first, they think it is David, but after a series of horrible attacks on Samantha, they suspect otherwise. One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word \\"MARON\\". Thomas suggests that Ellen and Samantha stay at a hotel while he sets up traps around the house with bells and wire. When the bells ring, Thomas investigates. The wire and bell outside his door are ripped from the wall and thrown at him. Thomas shuts himself in the bedroom and the demon bangs on his door. Thomas receives a phone call from Ellen, who is in hysterics after the demon apparently followed them and attacked Samantha. Upon returning to the house, Samantha hunches over in pain. Thomas awakens at night and finds his sister missing. He finds the attic ladder hanging down and ascends it to find her standing there undressed, in a trance. Upon awakening, she is unable to remember what happened. Thomas asks the previous owner of the house if anyone named Maron ever lived there, but the previous owner does not recognize the name. Thomas hears Samantha screaming and rushes to the bathroom to find her lying topless in the bathtub, severely traumatized. Ellen wakes after hearing thuds from outside. In the living room camera, she is seen standing in the archway with a knife before returning to her bedroom.

The crew of a malfunctioning alien cargo ship make an emergency landing on Earth. This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably. However, Willy, looking for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion and infer that he is a stronger being. While conducting a physical examination on Willy, Cosia discovers that his biology is more advanced than anything known to their species; encouraging Cosia with exaggerated claims about his sexual prowess, Willy loses his virginity to her. Later, he passes an intelligence test by a fluke and has sex with Partha.","output":"The men that fail the tests of the aliens are Oliver and Cliff."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: yeah i got a wait call hang on a second Here is a hypothesis: I don't have any calls and I can talk now. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine if the given premise (P) leads to the hypothesis (H) being true, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. Let's examine the premise and hypothesis more closely. Premise (P): \\"Yeah, I got a wait call hang on a second.\\" The premise states that the speaker has received a call and, therefore, needs the listener to wait while attending to it. It implies that the speaker will temporarily be unavailable or unable to engage in a conversation with the listener. Hypothesis (H): \\"I don't have any calls and I can talk now.\\" The hypothesis states that the speaker is not currently receiving any calls and is available to engage in a conversation with the listener. Now, let's evaluate if the premise being true would necessarily lead to the hypothesis being true. The premise refers to a specific event in which the speaker is receiving a call and becomes temporarily unavailable. Conversely, the hypothesis is a scenario in which the speaker is not receiving any calls and is available for a conversation. From this analysis, we can conclude that the premise and hypothesis are not directly related. The premise doesn't provide any information about when or under which conditions the speaker might be available to talk again. The hypothesis presents a different situation that may or may not happen after the premise occurs, but it is not guaranteed that the hypothesis will be true if the premise is true. In short, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The given premise and hypothesis are independent scenarios, and the truthfulness of one does not necessarily affect or lead to the truthfulness of the other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first name comes from the verb to \\"cop\\", meaning to \\"take\\" or \\"capture\\", and the second comes from the first name of Sir Robert Peel, the nineteenth-century politician, who was the founder of the police force as we know it today. An early nickname for the policeman was \\"peeler\\", but this one has died out.

A music-hall song of some years ago was called, \\"If You Want To Know The Time, Ask A Policeman\\". Nowadays, most people own watches but they still seem to find plenty of other questions to ask the policemen. In London, the policemen spend so much of their time directing visitors about the city that one wonders how they ever find time to do anything else! Two things are noticeable to the stranger, when he sees an English policeman for the first time. The first is that he does not carry a gun and the second is that he wears a very special type of helmet . His helmet, together with his height, enables an English policeman to be seen from a long distance, a fact that is not without its usefulness. From time to time it is suggested that the policeman should be given a gun and that his helmet should be taken from him, but both these suggestions are not accepted by the majority of the public and the police themselves.

Background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Paragraph: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, zone A or zone B? A:","output":"Zone A is a result of algae overgrowth.  In the given paragraph, it has been explained that Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture, and he has noticed two distinct zones, zone A and zone B. Zone A is located near agricultural lands and has been declared as a dead zone, whereas zone B is near a national park and has not been declared as a dead zone.  Dead zones are areas in bodies of water where oxygen levels are too low to support most aquatic life. This is primarily due to the excessive growth of algae, often caused by an influx of nutrients such as nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers. When algae population increases rapidly, it is referred to as an algal bloom, and these algal blooms consume carbon dioxide, deplete oxygen levels, and create dead zones after the algae die and decomposers use up the remaining oxygen to break down the dead organic matter.  As zone A is a dead zone near agricultural lands, it can be inferred that its condition is a result of algae overgrowth, which in turn is due to high levels of nutrients from fertilizers used in the nearby agricultural areas. Zone B, on the other hand, is located near a national park and has not been declared as a dead zone, indicating that it is not currently affected by the overgrowth of algae or the associated depletion of oxygen. Therefore, zone A is the correct answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar), the band included D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums) in its original incarnation. It has undergone many line-up changes over the course of its existence, with the current lineup being Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock,progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Context: After the breakup of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer.  Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, \\"We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.\\" On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.  In 1989 the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, \\"I Am One\\", in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, \\"Tristessa\\", on Sub Pop, after which they signed to Caroline Records. The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin for 20,000. In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction. Gish became a minor success, with the single \\"Rhinoceros\\" receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline. The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression, writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time. Question: How was the band formed? Answer:","output":"The Smashing Pumpkins was formed by Billy Corgan and James Iha in Chicago, Illinois in 1988. Billy had moved back to Chicago after his previous band broke up, and he met James while working at a record store. They started writing songs together, influenced by bands like The Cure and New Order. Later, Billy met D'arcy Wretzky after a concert, and after learning she played bass guitar, he invited her to join the band. They performed at a nightclub, and the club owner asked them to replace their drum machine with a live drummer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: UPDATE 1-Thai c.bank holds key rate, says growth forecast to be cut again * Committee votes 7-0 to hold policy rate at 1.50 pct * Says weak baht supportive of growth * Says 2015 GDP growth seen below forecast of 3 pct BANGKOK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank on Wednesday left its already-low benchmark interest rate steady again, signalling its belief that the weakening baht can aid exports and economic recovery better than a rate cut can. The Bank of Thailand said its 2015 growth forecast of 3.0 percent is being lowered again, due to poor exports, but said it won't give the new one until Sept. 25. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-0 to leave the one-day repurchase rate at 1.50 percent. In June, it also voted unanimously to hold, following 25 basis point cuts in March and April. Twenty of 23 economists in a Reuters poll predicted no change on Wednesday. \\"The conduct of monetary policy has thus far eased monetary conditions, while the direction of exchange rate movement has stayed conducive to the economic recovery,\\" the MPC said in a statement after Wednesday's meeting. The economy continued to recover gradually in the second quarter, and is expected to maintain the similar pace of recovery for the rest of the year, but downside risks increased from a slowdown in the Chinese economy and a domestic drought, it added. The central bank expected the Fed to raise rates in September but was confident the move would not cause big risks for Thai financial markets, Mathee Supapongse, secretary of the MPC, told a briefing. \\"The spectre of the Fed's lift-off is also suspected a factor to stay the hands of the MPC members\\" from cutting, said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research at Kasikornbank in Bangkok. Faraz Syed, economist of Moody's Analytics in Sydney, said economic signs are \\"still quite grim\\" and there might be a rate cut towards year-end \\"particularly if demand indicators fail to pick up\\". The military government has been unable to move Southeast Asia's second-largest economy forward and two key engines, exports and domestic demand, are not firing. The economy grew only 0.9 percent last year. Mathee said the baht's weakness \\"is helping economic growth even though the pace may be a little fast but the direction is beneficial.\\" On Wednesday, the baht stayed at 35.11 against the dollar after the rate decision. The baht has depreciated 6.2 percent this year and the government is hoping it will boost sagging exports. Deputy Prime Minister Pridiyathorn Devakula told Reuters last month a weaker baht would help growth more than a rate cut. Exports tumbled in June at the steepest annual rate since late 2011 and are expected to contract for the third year in 2015.

Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"California\\" correctly answer the question \\"Women who are not divorced can't obtain child support in which state?\\"?

First, we'll simplify the equation. We have -582*x and -1609*x on the right side, so we'll add them together:    -582*x +(-1609*x) = -2191*x    So now our equation is:    896*x = -2191*x + 12348 2. Now, we will add 2191*x to both sides of the equation to get all the x terms on one side:    896*x + 2191*x = 12348    This simplifies to:    3087*x = 12348 3. Finally, we will divide both sides by 3087 to find out the value of x:    x = 12348 / 3087 4. When we divide 12348 by 3087, we find that:    x = 4 So, the solution to our math problem is x = 4.

Summarize this article: Leyla Yunus and her husband Arif Yunus, an academic, were hoping to board a flight from the capital Baku to Doha in Qatar, but were held at the airport. They were released after a night in custody. But her passport was withheld. Her arrest comes amid a crackdown on human rights activists and journalists in the oil-rich ex-Soviet state. Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev family since 1993, soon after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Mrs Yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between Azerbaijan and its next-door neighbour and bitter rival Armenia. Earlier this month journalist Rauf Mirkadyrov, who worked with her on the Armenian project, was arrested and accused of spying for Armenia. Mrs Yunus predicted last week that she faced imminent arrest. On Tuesday morning, after her overnight detention, she was taken back to her home but refused to let police search it without a warrant. Amid the tension her husband fell ill and was taken to hospital. Doctors told the BBC Azeri service he had suffered from hypertension and was stable. Mrs Yunus told journalists outside her house that during her 11-hour detention she was not allowed to use the toilet, and when finally allowed to go it was only in the presence of a male police officer. \\"It's like torture, like the Middle Ages,\\" she said.  \\"I haven't slept for a whole day.\\" She was later released, but her office was searched. Azerbaijan has been repeatedly criticised by human rights organisations for stifling dissent, jailing opponents and obstructing democracy. Nevertheless, it is preparing to assume the chairmanship of the council of ministers of the Council of Europe, Europe's top human rights body. Ilham Aliyev was elected for a third term as president in October, though he did not even run a campaign, in a vote opponents said was undemocratic and fraudulent. Azerbaijan said the vote was fair. Summary:","output":"A lady named Leyla Yunus and her husband, Arif Yunus, wanted to take a plane from one city to another but were stopped at the airport and kept there for a night.

OPTIONS:  --No;  --Yes; Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the elements in whole grain oats and whether wheat can be considered as an element in them. Step 1: Understand the composition of whole grain oats Whole grain oats are made from the oat kernel, which contains three main parts: the bran (outer protective layer), the endosperm (starchy middle layer), and the germ (nutrient-rich innermost part). Whole grain oats contain all three parts and are a good source of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Step 2: Consider the relation between oats and wheat Oats and wheat are both cereal grains, but they belong to different species within the grass family. Oats are scientifically classified as Avena sativa, while wheat is classified as Triticum aestivum. Although they share some similarities, these grains have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and textures. Step 3: Determine if wheat can be considered an element of whole grain oats Since oats and wheat are different grains, wheat cannot be considered an element of whole grain oats. The elements in whole grain oats refer to the components of the oat kernel (bran, endosperm, and germ) and the nutrients they provide, not the presence of other grains.

Movie plot title: Fear and Desire Movie plot: Fear and Desire opens with an off-screen narration by actor David Allen who tells the audience:  There is a war in this forest. Not a war that has been fought, nor one that will be, but any war. And the enemies who struggle here do not exist unless we call them into being. This forest then, and all that happens now is outside history. Only the unchanging shapes of fear and doubt and death are from our world. These soldiers that you see keep our language and our time, but have no other country but the mind.[4] The story is set during a war between two unidentified countries. An airplane carrying four soldiers from one country has crashed six miles behind enemy lines. The soldiers come upon a river and build a raft, hoping they can use the waterway to reach their battalion. As they are building their raft, they are approached by a young peasant girl who does not speak their language. The soldiers apprehend the girl and bind her to a tree with their belts. The youngest of them is left behind to guard the girl. He starts to talk to her, but as she doesn't understand him he talks always more as a delirium and when he unbelts her believing she will embrace him, she tries to escape and the young soldier shoots her dead. Mac, another soldier of the four persuades the commander to let him take the raft for a solo voyage in connection with a plan to kill an enemy general at a nearby base. The remaining two soldiers successfully infiltrate the base. They talk and eat with their own general and return to the river to await Mac. Sitting there they philosophize about war and how no man is made for it.[5] Answer:","output":"When the girl is unbelted by the young soldier, she tries to escape from him.

Per Variety, the company has acquired the rights to Casting JonBenet, a documentary by Kitty Green set to debut at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah later this month. After its premiere in Park City, the film—which Netflix says will be its first nonfiction flick to make a Sundance showing—will air on Netflix and in some theaters nationwide in the spring. The filmmakers plumbed the community of Boulder, Colo., where the Ramsey family lived when JonBenet was killed, documenting locals looking back on the unsolved crime and analyzing its effect on families there. \\"Netflix is the ideal home for showcasing Kitty’s sharply rendered vision of a mythic American tragedy to a global audience,\\" a Netflix programming exec says. Rolling Stone and the Hollywood Reporter note the film joins a glut of recent JonBenet coverage, including Lifetime's Who Killed JonBenet?, A&E's The Killing of JonBenet: The Truth Uncovered, and CBS' The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey, which spurred a lawsuit from JonBenet's brother, Burke (the special theorized Burke may have accidentally killed her).

Right A:","output":"Title: Behind Hazel Eyes Genre: Psychological thriller, Drama Plot: Act 1:  Meet Kazuo Watanabe, a young aspiring artist living in the bustling city of Tokyo. With his hazel-colored eyes and remarkable artistic talent, he quickly gains popularity and fame in the art scene. Despite his success, Kazuo has a dark secret—he frequently experiences hallucinations and hears voices in his head, but he has long kept this to himself. One day, during a showcase of his artwork, Kazuo notices a lonely figure standing in the corner—the mysterious Akira. Flamboyant and eccentric, Akira shares Kazuo's passion for art and the two become fast friends. Soon, Akira seems to grow increasingly obsessed with Kazuo's unique hazel eyes, admiring the depth and mystery they hold. Act 2: Kazuo begins to trust Akira and opens up about his hallucinations and the voices in his head. Akira claims he can help Kazuo overcome his struggles in exchange for a chance to paint Kazuo's portrait—an offer too good to pass up. However, rather than finding solace, Kazuo finds himself spiraling deeper into his disorder, with the voices and hallucinations becoming more terrifying and vivid. Unbeknownst to Kazuo, Akira isn't truly there to help. Fascinated by the chaotic nature of Kazuo's mind, he starts to manipulate him slowly, convincing him that the hallucinations are part of his artistic genius. As Kazuo's mental state deteriorates, he distances himself from his friends and family, turning to Akira as his only confidant. Act 3: In the climax of the film, Akira convinces Kazuo that the cause of his internal chaos lies within his right hazel eye—in order to be free and attain true artistic greatness, he must remove it. Desperate and lost, Kazuo agrees to the horrifying proposition. The tense and chilling scene ensues where Akira carefully extracts Kazuo's right eye with cold precision. Kazuo, writhing in pain, loses consciousness and wakes up in a hospital bed days later. The doctors inform him that he was found alone in his apartment, suffering from extreme psychosis and self-mutilation. The final act concludes as Kazuo, now blind in his right eye and haunted by the terrible consequences of his actions, comes to learn that Akira had never been a real person. Instead, he was just a manifestation of the very madness that consumed Kazuo—his dark side personified. In the end, Kazuo must come to terms with his actions, finding a way to rebuild his life and embrace both the light and darkness within him. As he embarks on this journey of healing and self-discovery, he learns that true power comes from embracing one's vulnerability, rather than running from it. In a bittersweet conclusion, Kazuo's story serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked mental illness and the importance of seeking help before it's too late."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. If more than one seedling sprouts in the same pot, then snip the weakest seedlings with scissors. This will make room for the healthiest seedling. You can also transplant all of the seedlings into separate containers, but keep in mind that this is riskier. Once your plant reaches maturity, transplant it to a larger pot whenever the roots come out the drainage hole or press against the sides of the container. The soil should remain moist at all times, but never soggy. If the sensitive plant is in a dry room, mist it with water occasionally, or place it on a humidity tray. Sensitive plants are an invasive weed in many areas. Unless you are in one of their native habitats in tropical America, you may want to grow sensitive plants indoors. Gardeners worldwide report the plant taking over their lawns. In Australia, you are legally required to minimize the spread of mimosa pudica seeds off your property. Dilute a balanced fertilizer to half the strength recommended on the label. Apply to the soil once a week during the growing season, and once a month during winter. Since it is a tropical plant, Mimosa pudica will grow best if nighttime temperatures are 70ºF (21ºC) or higher. If temperatures fall below 65ºF (18ºC), move the plant to a warmer room or keep the plant warm in other ways. Adult plants can survive temperatures as low as 40ºF (4.5 °C), but are at risk of damage or death. Keep an eye out for yellow leaves and stems, which are signs of possible cold damage. It's normal for the stem to fall over and creep along the ground once the plant matures. Provide a trellis or sturdy plant to support it, or allow enough horizontal space for it to grow. Some sensitive plants grow more than 1 meter (3 ft) high or 2 meters (6.6 ft) horizontally, but in temperate zones they will more likely reach half this size. Mimosa pudica can survive for at least two years in tropical climates, but are usually annual plants in temperate zones. Even if your plant survives after its first bloom (usually in summer), you may have better results letting it die and collecting its seeds for next spring. To collect seeds, let the pods dry on the plant, then break them open and collect the seeds. The sensitive plant is not particularly prone to disease, but it may become infested with some common pests, such as red spider mites, mealy bugs, and thrips. These can be removed by spraying the plant with a direct stream of water or neem oil every few days. Avoid using insecticidal soaps, as these can turn the leaves of the plant black.","output":"This article talks about how to care for sensitive plants by giving them enough space, keeping the soil moist, using fertilizer, managing temperature, providing support and dealing with pests, while also mentioning that they can be invasive weeds and should be grown indoors in non-native areas."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Former Dallas Cowboys tackle Josh Brent was released from jail on Sunday following his conviction for a drunken car crash that killed his friend and teammate, Jerry Brown, the Dallas County sheriff's office said. The 26-year-old Brent was convicted in January of intoxication manslaughter for the December 2012 crash that killed Jerry Brown, a Cowboys practice squad player. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years' probation. It was not immediately clear whether he would be required to report to a rehab facility to complete his six-month sentence, which was expected to end in July. Sentenced: Former Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent, pictured before his sentencing on Friday, must serve 180 days in prison for the fiery crash that killed his friend and fellow football player, Jerry Brown. Regret: Brent was convicted of killing his close friend in a 2012 car crash after drinking and driving. He could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for the fiery December 2012 crash. At Brent's January sentencing hearing, state District Judge Robert Burns scolded Brent for his actions, the Dallas Morning News reported. 'You are not the first Dallas Cowboy to kill someone with a vehicle, but I hope you’re the last,' the judge said. Brent and Brown were college teammates at the University of Illinois and roommates in Texas, where Brown was a practice squad linebacker for the Cowboys. Brent was a defensive tackle for the Cowboys. He retired from the NFL months before his January trial, though he could attempt to be reinstated now that he has been released. It's unclear whether the NFL will suspend him before he can play again. The night of the wreck, the two men were headed home from partying with fellow Cowboys at a nightclub when Brent lost control of his Mercedes, causing a fiery accident. Officers who arrived on scene said Brent was seen trying to pull Brown's body from the wreckage. Police say Brent's blood-alcohol level was tested shortly after the crash at 0.18 percent, more than twice the legal limit for drivers in Texas. Guilty: 25-year-old Brent, left, was convicted of. intoxication manslaughter after the drunk-driving crash that killed his. friend and Dallas Cowboys teammate Jerry Brown, right, in December 2012. Sadness: LaTasha Brent, Brent's mother, is helped from the court after her son's punishment was read. At trial, prosecutors argued that the. burly, 320-pound defensive tackle had as many as 17 drinks that night. of the crash and was driving around 110 miles per hour. One. prosecutor, Heath Harris, told jurors in closing arguments: 'This is. almost like a poster child case for intoxication manslaughter.' He and fellow prosecutor, Jason Hermus, had urged the jury to send a message about the seriousness of Brent's crime, saying drunk-driving put the public in danger. Brent's attorneys argued the blood tests. used by police were faulty and that Brent could not have drank nearly. that much. Attorney George Milner said his client was 'guilty of being. stupid behind the wheel of a car,' not drinking beforehand. Brent retired from the NFL last year,. but his ties to the Cowboys were prominent at trial. Loss: Stacey Jackson, Brown's mother, cried as she testified in the penalty phase of the trial Thursday. Hugs: Josh Brent gets a hug from family after closing arguments in his intoxication manslaughter trial Tuesday, January 21. On Wednesday, a jury convicted him of the charge. Two current. players, Barry Church and Danny McCray, testified about hanging out with. Brent and Brown, first playing video games, then having dinner and. going to Privae, a Dallas nightclub. Jurors. saw video of Brent appearing to hold bottles of Champagne in each hand. and credit-card receipts that showed Brent had purchased three bottles. They. also saw police dash cam footage of Brent losing his balance during. field sobriety tests and occasionally stumbling over his words while. talking to officers. Among those in the courtroom were Stacey Jackson, Brown's mother. Jackson has publicly forgiven Brent, according to KMSP- TV. Prosecutor Rebecca Dodds. had emphasized Brent's 2009 drunken driving arrest in Illinois to press. the state's argument that he deserved prison time. In that case, he served 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge. Fatal: Josh Brent's Mercedes flipped over and landed on its roof in the December 2012 crash. 'Probation doesn't work for Josh Brent,' prosecutor Rebecca Dodds told the jury during closing statements in the punishment phase. The. sentencing comes just after weeks of fierce debate about a North Texas. teen, Ethan Couch, who received probation for intoxication manslaughter. after a wreck that left four people dead. Couch's case, and the so-called 'affluenza' defense his attorneys employed, became the subject of fierce, widespread scrutiny. Brent, a defensive tackle, had played in. all 12 games of the 2012 NFL season before the crash. He retired in. July. Brown was signed to the Cowboys' practice squad in the 2012. season.

Question 2: What is the meaning of coins on the eyes of the dead? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Although the answers to these two questions address a similar subject, the focus of each question is different, and as such, their answers will not be exactly the same. Let me elaborate on each question. Answer to Question 1: When a person is dead, do we need to place coins over the corpse's eyes? In modern times and most contemporary cultures, it is not necessary to place coins on the eyes of a deceased person. The practice of putting coins over the eyes of the dead has historical and cultural connotations but is not an essential part of modern funeral rites or mandatory customs. The tradition of placing coins on the eyes of the deceased can be traced back to the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. It was associated with the belief in the afterlife and the journey of the soul to the underworld. According to the ancient myth, once a person died, their soul needed to cross the river Styx or Acheron to reach the underworld, and the ferryman Charon required payment to guide the souls across the river. The coins, placed on the eyes or the mouth of the deceased, were considered payment to Charon. In other cultures, coins or some form of currency might be placed with the dead for similar reasons. However, in today's world, this custom is not widely practiced, and it does not apply to the majority of funerals or burial ceremonies across various cultures. Answer to Question 2: What is the meaning of coins on the eyes of the dead? As mentioned earlier, placing coins on the eyes of the dead has its roots in ancient Greek and Roman beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife. The meaning behind this tradition centers around the concept of the soul's passage to the underworld and ensuring that the deceased would have the necessary payment to secure their journey. The act of putting coins over the corpse's eyes had a symbolic significance, as it demonstrated a connection between the living and the deceased and helped to ensure a proper burial. Family members and friends would often place coins as a gesture of respect and remembrance, acknowledging the relationship they had with the person during their life and wishing them a safe passage to the afterlife. Throughout history, the tradition has been adopted and adapted by various cultures and societies, sometimes with differences in beliefs and practices. In some instances, placing coins or other valuable items with the deceased was considered a way to provide them with the resources they might need in the afterlife. Emphasis might be placed on the types and denominations of coins used, potentially representing the wealth and social standing of the deceased or their family members. In summary, while both answers explore the topic of placing coins on the eyes of the dead, the first question focuses on whether it's necessary in contemporary times, and the second question delves into the historical and cultural meanings behind the practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1962, Faber College freshmen Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Kroger and Kent Dorfman seek to join a fraternity. Finding themselves out of place at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house's party, they visit the slovenly Delta Tau Chi house next door, where Kent is a \\"legacy\\" who cannot be rejected due to his brother having been a member. John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky welcomes them, and they meet other Deltas including biker Daniel Simpson \\"D-Day\\" Day, ladies' man Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald \\"Boon\\" Schoenstein, whose girlfriend Katy is constantly pressuring him to stop drinking with the Deltas and do something with his life. Larry and Kent are invited to pledge and given the fraternity names \\"Pinto\\" and \\"Flounder\\" respectively, by Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms. College Dean Vernon Wormer wants to remove the Deltas, who are already on probation, so he invokes his emergency authority and places the fraternity on \\"double-secret probation\\" due to various campus conduct violations and their abysmal academic standing. He directs the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard to find a way for him to remove the Deltas from campus. Various incidents, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse belonging to Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Douglas Neidermeyer, and an attempt by Otter to date Marmalard's girlfriend further increase the Dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas. Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk.... Answer:","output":"\\"Legacy of Rebellion: The Battle for Faber College\\" In 1962, amidst the backdrop of Faber College's prestigious reputation, a group of misfit freshmen finds themselves navigating the treacherous world of fraternities and campus politics. \\"Legacy of Rebellion: The Battle for Faber College\\" tells the story of Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Kroger, Kent Dorfman, and their outcast Delta Tau Chi brothers as they struggle against the oppressive rule of College Dean Vernon Wormer and Omega Theta Pi fraternity. As legacy membership guarantees Kent a place within the notoriously unruly Delta fraternity, he and Larry – soon to be known as \\"Pinto\\" and \\"Flounder\\" – encounter a motley crew of brothers including wild child John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky, smooth-talking Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton, rugged biker Daniel Simpson \\"D-Day\\" Day, and the ever-conflicted Donald \\"Boon\\" Schoenstein, who is torn between his loyalty to the Deltas and his girlfriend, Katy. The film follows the intense rivalry between the downtrodden Deltas and the privileged Omega Theta Pi as the ever-scheming Dean Wormer plots to expel the Deltas from campus. With their status already on thin ice, the Deltas find themselves facing the wrath of Wormer's secret weapon: \\"double-secret probation.\\" As tensions escalate, a series of pranks and accidents – including the untimely demise of an Omega member's beloved horse – push the Deltas further out of favor. As the Omega's cunning president Greg Marmalard works to provide Wormer with the ammunition to remove the Deltas, an unexpected romance between Otter and Marmalard's girlfriend adds fuel to the fire. This chaos culminates in the Deltas falling victim to a hoax orchestrated by the Omegas, resulting in their disastrous performance on an important exam and bringing them one step closer to expulsion. Yet, even as their time on campus seems to be running out, the Deltas refuse to go quietly. With unshakable spirits, they rally together and throw an unforgettable toga party, enlisting the musical talents of Otis Day and the Knights. As the night unfolds, relationships are both formed and tested, ultimately solidifying the Deltas' bond. \\"Legacy of Rebellion: The Battle for Faber College\\" is a heartfelt testament to camaraderie, defiance, and the unbreakable bonds of brotherhood. The film captures the spirit of youth and resistance to conformity, reminding us that it is often the outcasts who make the most memorable impact."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Karly Smith, an ambitious university student, works part-time as a babysitter to help pay her fees. She is known in her suburban neighborhood for her lively spirit and professional work ethics.  One rainy evening, Karly is booked to babysit for the eccentric Harrington family who live in a large vacant house rumored to be cursed since the death of its previous owner. The family is composed of the parents, a teenage son, and a little girl called Bunky, who is notorious for her mischievous tricks and wild imagination. The Harringtons leave for their Gala night, leaving Karly with instructions for bedtime routines and a word of caution about Bunky's odd games. As the night creeps, everything appears normal until Karly realizes Bunky is missing. She starts searching within the vast house with hidden staircases and secret rooms. As Karly delves deeper into the house, she begins to hear strange sounds, giggling echoed from the walls, and random objects moving on their own. She grows anxious but stays committed to finding Bunky. She confides in the teenage son, urging him to help, but he dismisses her, consumed by his video games. Meanwhile, Bunky is actually hidden away, enjoying the prank she's playing. But she accidentally stumbles upon a hidden diary that provides insight into the previous owner's life, his mystical experiments, and the curse he cast on the house. Being a child, she is oblivious to the seriousness and opens a secret chamber, releasing the trapped spirits. As supernatural events accelerate, Karly and the teenage son now band together to find Bunky and unfold the truth about the curse. With the guidance from the old diary, they navigate haunted hallways, risky traps, and confront the erstwhile owner's spirit demanding freedom. The climax circles around an intense face-off with the spirit, where Karly, showcasing her courage and resourcefulness, agrees to help the spirit find its peace. With Bunky's innocent assistance, they perform a ceremony to break the curse and free the spirit, causing the paranormal activities to cease. The movie ends on a heartwarming note, with Bunky safely returned, a newfound respect for Karly from the Harrington family, and the house no longer vacant but filled with love and laughter.

Background: Durant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C., to Wanda (nee Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father re-entered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments. Durant has one sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne. Context: Prior to the start of the 2010-11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately 86 million. For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game. Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.  On February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets. At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title. Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed. In Game 1 of the first round against the Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining. Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the Finals. For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.  With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012-13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50-40-90 club. Finishing the year with a 60-22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason. Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility, averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs, but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games. Question: how did he do with the thunder?. Whats the answer?","output":"Kevin Durant had a successful stint with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He signed a five-year contract extension worth approximately 86 million before the 2010-11 season and led the NBA in scoring for two consecutive years. Under Durant's leadership, the Thunder performed well in both regular-season and playoffs games. They reached the Conference Finals in 2011 and the NBA Finals in 2012, where they eventually lost to the Miami Heat. Despite not defending his scoring title in the 2012-13 season, Durant became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50-40-90 club, showcasing his scoring prowess.

Q:Given the below context:  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".  Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels  vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: \\"There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Rain causes the breaking apart and moving of rocks and what?\\" is soil. This is because rain contributes to the process of erosion, which involves the gradual wearing away of Earth's surface materials, such as rocks and soil, and their transportation from one location to another.  Erosion is an essential part of the natural processes that shape the Earth's landscape. While rain is just one cause of erosion, it is a significant one, because it can dislodge and wear away soil particles, as well as support the movement of sediments by creating runoff, streamflow, or even landslides in certain conditions.  Though other answer choices, such as abrasion, sand, reservoirs, earth, broken, ground, and roads, are related to erosion as well, they are not as directly relevant or accurate as soil: 1. Abrasion: This is a process of erosion where materials are gradually worn down through contact with other materials, like pebbles being ground against rocks in a riverbed. While it is an aspect of erosion, it is not as direct an answer as soil. 2. Sand: This is a type of sediment material, usually made of tiny granules of rock or mineral. Sand can be formed, transported, or deposited by erosion, but it is neither as comprehensive nor as specific as soil. 3. Reservoirs: These are artificial or natural bodies of water, which can be impacted by erosion. However, they are not, themselves, materials that are broken up and transported by rain. 4. Earth: This is a more general term, referring to the planet as a whole, or sometimes to soil or ground. In the context of the question, soil is the more precise term to use. 5. Broken: This term describes the state of something that is fractured or damaged but does not specifically refer to materials moved by erosion. 6. Ground: While ground can be impacted by erosion, and it may include soil or rocks, it is still a less specific term than soil, which is the material broken apart and moved directly through erosion. 7. Roads: These human-made structures can be affected by erosion, and their construction can sometimes exacerbate erosion or change water flow patterns. However, they are not the material that is moved during erosion, as the question asks. Thus, considering the context and the specific focus on materials that are broken apart and moved during the process of erosion due to rain, soil is the most accurate and suitable answer choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Motorists trapped in NYPD checkpoint can take suit to trial Tuesday, March 22, 2016, 4:46 PM Three motorists who claim they were trapped in the same unlawful checkpoint set up by NYPD highway cops in Queens have received a green light to take their lawsuit to trial, a federal judge has ruled. Winston McLennon of Brooklyn, Karlick Price of Queens, and Stephen Augustine of Ohio, were stopped between 2011 and 2014 on the one-lane service ramp leading from the Grand Central Parkway to the Long Island Expressway. There were no traffic cones, warning lights, or flares — only an unmarked vehicle jutting into the roadway which forced the drivers to slow down and stop when they were approached by cops from the Highway Unit No. 3, according to papers filed in Brooklyn Federal Court. BRONX DA AIDE SUES AFTER LOSING HER JOB OVER HER ARREST In McLennon's case, the cop claimed he was stopped because he was driving with air fresheners hanging from his rear-view mirror, which is a violation of the vehicle and traffic law. The plaintiffs claimed they were falsely arrested on trumped up traffic violations as a result of improper checkpoints. Later, five criminal court judges in Queens threw out similar cases against motorists pulled over on the service ramp and the Legal Aid Society reported those decisions to the NYPD. Federal Judge Margo Brodie ruled that the allegations plausibly allege that NYPD transportation bureau commanders Thomas Chan and James Tuller were on notice that the cops from that highway unit needed better supervision. A jury will decide whether the plaintiffs are entitled to monetary damages. BROOKLYN BOROUGH PRESIDENT CONDEMNS COPS WHO CUFFED MAILMAN Brodie declined to grant class action status to the case, because there was no evidence that the unlawful checkpoint was a widespread practice. \\"The court dismissed allegations of a widespread unlawful practice and we are litigating the remaining claims,\\" a spokesman for the city Law Department said in a statement. The plaintiffs' lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.","output":"Three people said they were stopped by police at a checkpoint that wasn't set up properly, and now a judge has said they can take their case to trial.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.  Which city experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Tokyo experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking. This is due to the fact that Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City. Since the sudden release of energy from rocks breaking is what causes earthquakes, the higher frequency of earthquakes in Tokyo is indicative of a greater amount of energy being released from the rocks breaking in that region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules.

Firstly, the user interface is straightforward yet visually appealing, with the app being well-organized, thus allowing users to navigate through its features seamlessly. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced blogger, the app caters to diverse demands, ensuring you get a quality experience while managing your blog on the go. Creating and editing content has improved significantly with the latest feature updates.

Additionally, you can embed images, videos, and even audio files straight from your smartphone or tablet with great ease. You also have the option to schedule or backdate posts, giving you autonomy over the timeline of your posts. The app also allows for seamless collaboration; granting multiple users permission to contribute to a particular blog. Permissions can be easily managed, enabling a great deal of flexibility while working on a blog with a team. The app also keeps a track of all revisions in real-time, ensuring you have a clear overview of the changes made by collaborators. However, the app could improve in certain areas. The most notable is sometimes there are synchronization issues between the app and the desktop version. It may take a few tries to get both platforms in sync, which can be genuinely disruptive. While this issue doesn't occur often, it’s a slightly disappointing aspect. Another area worth mentioning is the app's push notifications. Although real-time updates on comments and likes are helpful, there are times when the notifications tend to be overwhelming and a bit distracting.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What species has recently been re-introduced in Skye? is inside the article: The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common domestic fowls.\\" In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle. The eggs of the last breeding pair of  white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced.

Since then, efforts have been made to re-introduce the white-tailed sea eagle to the area as part of conservation programs aimed at restoring the biodiversity of the Hebrides islands, including Skye. The successful re-introduction of this species marks an important step in preserving the unique variety of flora and fauna found in this region and ensuring the ecological health of the island for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The title should be descriptive of the agreement, for example: Independent Consulting, Independent Contractor Agreement, or Freelance Web Design Contract. Center your title in bold type at the top of the contract like this:Independent Contractor Agreement After each name, include the title by which you will refer to that party throughout the contract. If dealing with a business, include its full legal name with the “Inc.” or “LLC” suffix; do not include the names of the individuals signing the contract on behalf of that business. Here are two examples:  This Independent Contractor Agreement (\\"Agreement\\") is made and entered into by and between, John Doe (\\"Contractor\\") and Jane Smith (\\"Client\\"). John Doe (\\"Contractor\\") and Jane Smith (\\"Client\\") agree as follows: . . . The length of the description will depend on the complexity of the job. There is no reason to make the description more complicated than necessary. Nevertheless, you should define the scope of work with sufficient clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract.  “Contractor will help Client throw a party” is too broad. Will you provide food and music, or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services? Will you hire crew to set-up the party and/or provide cleanup? You need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn’t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do. You could write, “Contractor will organize Client’s party by hiring caterers, musicians, florists, and crew to perform set-up and take-down. Contractor will also supervise these same.”  Sometimes a short description will work. This works best for businesses that provide services that can be summarized in a brief paragraph. For example, a social media consultant might describe the job as follows: “Setting up and maintaining social media accounts for Client with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Developing and implementing social advertising campaign, and training current staff to continue with social marketing efforts.” If you can use a short description, then you might want to type: \\"Contractor will provide Client with the following services:\\" and then leave some blank lines or space. By doing this, you can reuse the same contract for multiple jobs. With each new job, you can just type or write in the description. Some tasks are self-explanatory. If you are confident there will be no dispute over what work is to be performed, you may want to use general terms for this section of the contract.  An example of general terms (as opposed to specific) would be to say \\"paralegal services,\\" \\"secretarial services,\\" or \\"consulting,\\" instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal, secretary, or consultant. Using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract, thereby reducing errors, and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client. If you provide a service that relies heavily on technical or design specifications, describing a project in your freelancing contract may mean your contract is several pages long and changes drastically from one client to the next. For services such as this, you may want to describe the job as providing client with \\"services described in the attached project plan.\\" By doing this, you can then attach each client’s personal project plan to his or her contract. Using this format gives you the flexibility of describing each job in detail without having to change your entire contract for each new job.","output":"This article teaches you how to write a clear and accurate contract for different jobs, including choosing the right title, describing the job with enough details, and using short or general terms when needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By highlighting the noteworthy aspects of the visuals, praise is being given to the creators or the natural forces that have made it possible. However, in some contexts, the phrase may also imply that the visual aspect of the production overpowers other essential components like storyline, acting, or the overall emotional depth and moral message of the work. In that case, while recognizing the technical and aesthetic prowess of the visuals, it may also imply that the substance of the production is lacking or not on par with the quality of the effects. That would be the only way this phrase could hold a more negative meaning, but it would depend on the context in which it is used. Nonetheless, the phrase \\"a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects\\" generally conveys appreciation and admiration for visually stunning and breathtaking experiences, and is considered to be a positive description."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Terror by Night Movie plot: An off-screen narrator tells of the deadly curse carried by the fabulous \\"Star of Rhodesia\\" diamond, then takes us to a London coffin-maker's, where Vivian Vedder (Renee Godfrey) arranges a special coffin for her late mother. She'll be taking it on the 7 PM train to Edinburgh. At Euston Station, Roland Carstairs (Geoffrey Steele) meets Holmes (Basil Rathbone), whom he has hired to guard his mother Lady Margaret (Mary Forbes), who has already boarded the train back home to Scotland. Actually, he's there to guard the Star of Rhodesia, which she has owned for many years, but was the object of an attempted theft when Lady Margaret wore it at a royal function. Holmes is certain the thieves will try again. Apparently, Scotland Yard agrees, as Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) is also taking the trip. The train begins to pull out, and Watson (Nigel Bruce) and his old army friend Major Duncan-Bleek (Alan Mowbray) barely manage to board. They had bumped into each other, and forgotten the time as they reminisced. Carstairs brings Holmes to his compartment, where his mother is skeptical about the aid of a \\"policeman\\", but she lets Holmes examine the Star.While Holmes, Watson, Duncan-Bleek, and Lady Margaret are in the dining car, Carstairs falls onto the floor of his compartment. Lestrade hears the thud, but finds the door to the Carstairs compartment locked. Holmes arrives and has the attendant (Billy Bevan) open it. They find Carstairs dead and the box that had contained the Star empty. The body shows no wounds aside from a tiny spot of blood, but Holmes declares it's murder, since a thief arriving right after Carstairs died of natural causes is too improbable. Watson, unimpressed with Lestrade's plodding, decides to try questioning suspects himself. (Thus suspects are those who occupy compartments in the same car, as the attendant was at the door to the leading car, and the trailing car is the locked luggage van.)

Even after  Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\" Mike\\" thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\"Iranian dangers\\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States.

Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Question: Why do some birds thrive in noisy environments? Options: A: Because there are fewer dangers.

Paragraph :  The higher the crests of a wave are, the greater the amplitude.  Question:   If Jimbo is surfing and the waves begin to crest lower, what happens to amplitude of those waves increases or decreases? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the amplitude of a wave is directly related to the height of its crests. As the height of the crests increases, the amplitude becomes greater, and conversely, as the height of the crests decreases, the amplitude becomes smaller. In the situation described, if Jimbo is surfing and the waves begin to crest lower, it means that the height of the wave crests is decreasing. As a result, according to the relationship explained in the paragraph, the amplitude of those waves will decrease.  In summary, when the waves crest lower while Jimbo is surfing, the amplitude of those waves decreases. This could potentially make the waves less forceful and less suitable for an exhilarating surfing experience, as a smaller amplitude typically translates to a less energetic wave."},{"instruction":"OPT: 1).

He was named \\"Artist of the Year\\" in Madagascar for two consecutive years (1998–1999), and the single \\"Malemilemy\\" received regular airplay across the island more than a year after the album was released. In July 1999, Jaojoby was named Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund and supported the United Nations' activities in Madagascar related to raising awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and other concerns relevant to the Malagasy youth population. The lyrics of his songs commonly address social issues, typified by a track on E! Tiako that encourages the use of condoms to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS.Aza Arianao was recorded over five days in the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which was recorded in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.The March 2008 release of Donnant-Donnant celebrated Jaojoby's roots as a cabaret performer of soul, funk, and other Western popular genres.

You are given a new situation: Joe is at a party and carrying around a can of beer that he has had in his hand for awhile. He bumps into Sally, and they begin chatting. During their conversation, Sally notices the beer in Joe's hand, and remarks that a beer sounds like a good idea. She heads over to the refrigerator and grabs a nice cold one and pops it open. She takes a sip while the two continue their chat.  and a hint : Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  Please answer this question : Which person's beer has molecules farther apart? A:","output":"A: Joe's beer has molecules farther apart. Step1: Understanding the given situation. In the given situation, Joe has been carrying around a can of beer for a while and Sally just got a fresh cold beer from the refrigerator. It is implied that since Joe has been holding the beer for some time, it is not as cold as Sally's freshly grabbed one. Step 2: Analyzing the properties of water and using the provided hint. According to the hint, the density of water increases as its temperature decreases until it reaches its highest density at around 4°C. Consequently, as the temperature of water in the beer decreases, the distance between molecules gets shorter. Step 3: Comparing the temperatures of Joe's and Sally's beers. Supposing that the party is held indoors at room temperature, Joe's beer is warmer than Sally's freshly taken cold beer.  Step 4: Applying the properties of water to the present situation. Since Joe's beer is warmer, the molecules in his beer are farther apart due to the lower density at higher temperatures. Therefore, Joe's beer has molecules that are farther apart than those in Sally's beer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie (Cynthia Watros), takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack. Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses. The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie.

Instead of worrying about sex, you and your partner can focus on emotional intimacy. Many sexual disorders occur because of various emotions or stressors that end up affecting the couple's sex life. Focusing on the relationship can help you strengthen your connection, which can lead to improved sex.  For example, you may want to go for walks together, go to dinner, or do other activities. You may want to spend an entire evening talking to one another. You also may want to spend time touching in non-sexual ways, such as holding hands, holding one another, and kissing for the sake of kissing. You may have relationship problems because of the sexual disorder. You and your partner may have had some misunderstandings because of your actions, and you may have developed trust issues. There may be outside stressors that are affecting your relationship. You should work on these issues with your partner to move your relationship past this small bump in the road. Clearing up relationship problems can help lead the way to improved sex. Removing miscommunication, anxieties, and any underlying anger or feelings of resentment can make it easier to feel closer and intimate with your partner. You may decide to go see a sex therapist or couples counselor. Going to see a therapist or counselor doesn't mean that something is wrong with your relationship. Sexual disorders can cause a strain on both partners and the relationship. A sex therapist may help you learn how to build intimacy and work on techniques to address the disorder, while a couples counselor may be able to help you work through any relationship issues that have arisen due to the disorder.  If your partner suggests going to counseling, don't get angry. See it as a way your partner is trying to support you and work on your relationship. Don't get discouraged if you want to go to counseling but your partner doesn't. You can search the internet for certified sex therapists and couples counselors in your area. You may also talk to your doctor or specialists about a referral. One way you can help boost your sexual function is to spend more time focusing on foreplay instead of heading straight for intercourse. Foreplay helps both partners enjoy the experience more. Foreplay can help a woman feel aroused and help a man get an erection.  Foreplay includes a lot of different things. Take time to explore each other's bodies and focus on your partner's pleasure. Don't rush towards orgasm. Slow down the sexual experience, which can help you overcome your sexual disorder. During foreplay, you may want to use your hands and your mouth. Try touching different parts of the body, not just the penis or vagina. Make the foreplay experience an emotionally intimate experience as well as a physical one. Lack of stimulation before intercourse can lead to problems such as a reduced level of arousal, inability to get or hold an erection, lack of lubrication, and inability to reach orgasm. Some people may need some sort of stimulation for up to an hour before they are ready for intercourse. Due to your sexual disorder, you and your partner may need some extra help. That's fine. For women who have trouble with lubrication or painful sex, consider using lubricants or vaginal creams to help with dryness.  Use toys to help enhance your sexual experience. Sexual toys may help increase stimulation during foreplay. You can use vibrating toys to stimulate the clitoris to help with female arousal problems, while the vibration may help a man get and maintain an erection. You may also want to try an erotic video or erotic literature. Watch the video together or read the literature to each other to help increase your physical and emotional intimacy. Some people have never been open or honest about what they like during sex. Take this time to tell your partner what you like or don't like during sex. Talk about things you'd like to try and experiment with. Try to be as specific as possible for your partner. Consider showing your partner what you like, or walking him or her through what to do for you.  Men who experience erectile problems or women who have trouble getting aroused may need more manual stimulation than his or her partner. Tell your partner that you need this so he or she knows how to help you during sex.  Remember to keep your words focused on your and not your partner. Don't accuse your partner of not satisfying you. Instead, say things like, “I really like when you touch my hair” or “My breasts are really sensitive. I would like you to touch them more.” Sometimes, couples get in a rut. They just do the same thing, and that doesn't lead to arousal or desire anymore. If this is the case for you and your partner, try experimenting. You may want to try different positions, participate in role play, or share fantasies that you both can act out.  For women who experience pain during sex, trying new positions may help make intercourse a more pleasurable experience. For example, try being on top so you can control the movement and position. When talking about role play or fantasies, make sure to remember that each partner may not feel comfortable with everything. You want to try new things your partner wants to try, but don't feel bad if there are things your partner suggests that you are not willing to do. Find a compromise on both sides where you both willingly engage in situations and fantasies your partner wants to try while still being comfortable.","output":"Taking a break from sex can be beneficial for addressing sexual disorders, allowing couples to focus on emotional intimacy and strengthen their connection. Addressing relationship issues, clearing up misunderstandings, and resolving trust problems can lead to improved sex.

Engaging in more foreplay, using sexual toys, and communicating openly about desires and preferences can enhance sexual experiences and help overcome disorders. Experimenting with different positions, roleplay, and fantasies can keep the relationship from becoming stagnant, ultimately improving the couple's sex life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

When it comes to your friends, you want to be able to support and comfort them during their times of need. However, it can sometimes be difficult to know the best way to help and provide that support. Not to worry! We have created a guide with four simple strategies on how to help a friend through rough times. By following these tips, you can be an empathetic and attentive companion who can provide solace and reassurance in their moments of strife. 1. Don't Be Afraid to Console Them Especially during tough times, people need someone who can listen and provide emotional support. As a friend, it's important to let your loved one know that you are there for them. Remember, consoling someone doesn't mean that you need to fix their problems. It simply means being available and providing a safe space for them to unburden their feelings. When offering consolation, keep the following tips in mind: - Be empathetic: Put yourself in your friend's position and consider how he or she might be feeling. This will help you to offer genuine comfort and understanding. - Listen actively: Make eye contact, nod, and affirm that you are listening without interrupting. - Offer reassuring words: Let your friend know that they're not alone, and that you're there to help. 2. Pray or Meditate with Them Prayer and meditation can offer tremendous solace during difficult times. By engaging in these activities with your friend, you promote a sense of connection and understanding between both of you. If your friend is open to it, consider the following: - Attending a religious service or study group together - Offering to pray together at home or in a sacred space - Turning to scriptural texts for wisdom and comfort - Meditating together quietly or through guided meditation exercises Even if your friend isn't religious or spiritual, sometimes the simple act of focusing on a higher power or inner self can encourage relaxation and healing. 3. Release Some Physical Energy Stress can build up in our bodies during challenging times. Engaging in physical activities can help relieve this tension and promote mental clarity. Here are a few ways to encourage your friend to release some physical energy: - Go for a walk or a jog together outside - Participate in group sports or fitness classes - Practice yoga or stretching exercises - Dance, either informally at home or in a group class These activities not only help with stress relief but also provide an opportunity for social interaction and bonding. Plus, physical exercise can boost mood and improve overall well-being. 4. Distract Your Friend While it's important to provide a space for your friend to express their feelings, sometimes a temporary distraction from their worries can be beneficial. Introducing enjoyable activities can help to improve their mood and reduce feelings of stress or sadness. Here are some ideas for light-hearted distractions: - Watch a feel-good movie or a favorite TV show together - Try a new hobby or craft - Cook or bake together and enjoy the fruits of your labor - Play board games or video games together - Attend a local event, such as a fair, concert, or festival Remember, the goal isn't to ignore or dismiss their concerns, but rather to provide a momentary escape that allows for a break from negative thoughts. Conclusion Supporting a friend during difficult times can be challenging, but by following these four steps – consoling them, praying or meditating together, releasing physical energy, and providing distractions – you can be a supportive and helpful companion. Your friend will appreciate the time and effort you put into being there for them and you'll strengthen the bond of your friendship by weathering this storm together. Remember, your care and understanding can make all the difference in helping your friend find solace and healing during their time of need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The building society - the UK's second biggest mortgage lender - said that 38% of properties were sold to cash buyers. It said that low interest rates had encouraged investment in bricks and mortar, while mortgage lending had been squeezed in recent years by the banks. It also said that UK house prices in May were 4.6% higher than a year ago. This was a slowdown from the 5.2% annual rate of increase recorded in April. Nationwide said this marked a resumption of a \\"gradual downward trend\\" in annual price growth which had begun last summer. However, prices in May were up 0.3% compared with April, taking the average price of a property to Â£195,166. The proportion of cash transactions - without the need for a mortgage - leapt in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, based on Nationwide's own data. Tighter credit conditions and unemployment drove the increase at this time, according to Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide. These elements would not have had the same effect on cash transactions. Last year, the average proportion of cash buyers was 36%, which then moved up to the new record level of 38% in the first quarter of this year. Figures published by the Bank of England suggests that the peak is unlikely to be extended, owing to a pick-up in mortgage lending. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to a 14-month high in April, Bank data showed on Tuesday. \\"I suspect [the proportion] will fall throughout the year as lenders and borrowers adjust to, and become more familiar with, the new lending rules,\\" said Alex Gosling, chief executive of online estate agents HouseSimple.com. \\"This realignment of buyers with lenders may well be evident in the strong mortgage approvals data issued this week by the Bank of England.\\" The actual number of cash buyers, rather than the proportion, has risen slightly since 2008, but has still not reached the peak seen during the housing boom of 2007. The highest proportion of cash buyers - nearly 50% - was in the North East of England, according to Nationwide figures from 2013. The second highest was in the South West of England. The proportion in London was only just above the national average. Mr Gardner told the BBC that this could be explained by the fact that the cost of homes in the North East was comparatively low compared with the rest of the country. The high level of cash transactions in the South West might be owing to a larger number of older owners, who already owned their homes outright, moving to another property - possibly smaller - without the need for a mortgage. He said there was no evidence that pensioners were cashing in pensions to buy property, and it was certainly too early to assess whether those new rules had affected the property market. It was also unlikely, he said, that young people were being bought homes outright by their parents as first-time buyers represented a relatively high proportion of mortgage applicants at present. The figures come as the government said that nearly 94,000 purchases have been completed under its Help to Buy scheme, aimed to help those who can afford mortgage payments but struggle to raise a deposit. Summary:","output":"The Nationwide Building Society reports that a record 38% of properties in the UK were sold to cash buyers in Q1 2015, up from 36% in 2014. Low interest rates have encouraged investment in property, while mortgage lending has been constrained in recent years. Nationwide's report also revealed that UK house prices in May 2015 were 4.6% higher than the previous year, although this was a slowdown from the 5.2% annual increase recorded in April.

Based on figures from 2013, the North East of England had the highest proportion of cash buyers (nearly 50%) followed by the South West, and London was just above the national average.

Article: New York City was dealing with a growing public health threat Sunday after tests confirmed that eight students at a private Catholic high school had contracted the same strain( type ) of the swine flu that has ravaged  Mexico. Some of the school's students had visited Cancun on a spring break trip two weeks ago. Officials reported 68 U.S. cases of swine flu in five states so far, with the latest in Ohio and New York. Unlike in Mexico, cases in the United State have been mild and U.S. health authorities can't yet explain why. In New York City, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that there were 45 cases, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. About 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School complained of flu-like symptoms; further tests will determine how many of those cases are swine flu. St. Francis is the largest private Catholic high school in the nation, with 2,700 students. The school canceled classes on Monday and Tuesday in response to the outbreak. Bloomberg stressed that the New York cases were mild and many are recovering, but said that some family members of students also had flu symptoms. In Mexico, health officials say a strain of swine flu has killed up to 160 people and sickened over 2,000. New York officials said the flu strain discovered in the patients here is the same strain as in Mexico, though all the New York cases are mild. Swine flu is a respiratory   disease of pigs caused by type A flu viruses. Human cases are uncommon but can occur in people who are around pigs. It also can be spread from person to person. Symptoms include a high fever, body aches, coughing, sore throat and respiratory congestion . Question: Which is the main idea of the article? Options: A: Swine flu is spreading quickly globally.

Here are the steps: Step 1: Write down the equation given. -20b + 128138 = 127518 Step 2: We need to get the \\"b\\" term isolated on one side of the equation. To do this, we have to get rid of the constant term (128138) on the left side of the equation.

Q:Given the background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  and the situation: Manny visited 2 countries. First he visited Australia, a country which respected the environment and produced zero air pollution, and New Zealand, a country which based its economy on burning fossil fuels and generated a lot of air pollution.  Answer the following question: Which country had fewer people with increased chances of dying from other diseases? A:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, the country with fewer people having increased chances of dying from other diseases would be Australia. Australia is described as a country that respects the environment and produces zero air pollution. In such a country, the air quality would be significantly better, which would not increase the risk of developing lung diseases like asthma and lung cancer. It also means that there would be a lower chance of people dying from other diseases related to air pollution. On the other hand, New Zealand is described as a country that bases its economy on burning fossil fuels, generating a lot of air pollution. In this situation, people living in New Zealand would have a higher risk of developing lung diseases due to poor air quality. Moreover, the increased air pollution would also increase the chances of people dying from other diseases related to air pollution.

Here are possible answers to this question: - noise - knocking over - put down - doesn - water mark  I believe the correct choice is \\"water mark\\", here's why: A:","output":"Bill is using a napkin under his cup as a form of protection for his table. The possible nuisances he wants to avoid could be noise, knocking over, putting down, or just simply does not want to. However, each of these reasons does not align precisely with the action of placing a napkin under a cup. Let's look at each of these potential answers one by one: 1. Noise: While friction between the cup and table might produce some noise, this is typically negligible and not something most people consider when setting a cup on a table. Therefore, using a napkin to reduce noise seems unlikely. 2. Knocking over: This is also an irrelevant point because a napkin does not prevent a cup from being knocked over. It can even make it more unstable due to the lack of direct contact with the table's surface. 3. Put down: This point may seem logical, but it is vague. \\"Put down\\" could mean numerous things. It does not directly connect with the need for a napkin under a cup.  4. Doesn't: This point is also irrelevant. The term \\"doesn't\\" is not an action or result. It's a contraction of \\"does not,\\" indicating the absence of an action. Again, it does not seem to relate to why someone would place a napkin under their cup on a table. Now, let's move to the final possible answer, Water Mark.  A water mark is a stain left on a surface by a cold glass or cup. When a cold cup is set on a table, condensation often forms on the outside of the cup. This moisture can drip down and create a ring of water on the table's surface. Over time, if this happens frequently, it can cause more permanent water marks or stains. By placing a napkin under his cup, Bill is providing a shield between the condensation on the cup and the table surface. The napkin effectively absorbs the moisture, protecting the table from these unsightly water marks or potential damage. Therefore, the correct choice in this context is \\"water mark\\". By placing a napkin under his cup, Bill is preventing a water mark from appearing on his table. This shows clear foresight on Bill's part to maintain the quality and aesthetics of his table surface. It's a small, yet smart action that helps preserve the furniture. This understanding falls entirely in line with the practice of using coasters or napkins under cups, particularly those containing cold liquids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Name of the Rose Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building. William encounters Salvatore, a demented hunchback, and...

Summarize: After meeting the president-elect - the first UK politician to do so - the UKIP leader said \\"be in no doubt\\" that Trump was a supporter of the UK, willing to be \\"very close partners.\\" Critics of Mr Trump should \\"stop whingeing\\" and \\"just get on with it.\\" Mr Trump, who takes office in January, has said the UK is a \\"special place\\". The incoming US president has spoken to Theresa May by phone and there have been other contacts between ministers and representatives of the incoming administration. Mr Farage, who campaigned alongside Mr Trump during the election, suggested that many British politicians, including some close to Theresa May, had been \\"quite rude\\" about him during his ascent to power and now must re-think their attitudes. \\"I do think that just too many members of this government said too many nasty things about the President-elect, and I think there has to be a mending of fences,\\" he said. There were huge opportunities to be had in \\"Brexit Britain\\", Mr Farage said, and Donald Trump would be a much more accommodating partner than his predecessor Barack Obama - who he suggested had \\"damaged\\" the relationship between both countries. Mr Farage told the BBC that there were some cabinet ministers who were open to the idea of his acting as a go-between with the president-elect, but said that Downing Street was more concerned with \\"saying I'm irrelevant\\". He called on the government to work closely with Mr Trump, saying: \\"There's a real opportunity here.\\" \\"Not only President-elect Trump, but his whole team is Anglophile. \\"They like our country, they recognise what we've done together in the past, and they're coming into this with an incredibly positive view. We need to seize the day.\\" Mr Farage denied that he would seek to work within Mr Trump's administration, saying: \\"I'm not an American citizen, I'm not going to be getting a job with his team any time soon.\\" It's the image that encapsulates politics in 2016. President-elect Trump, in an open necked shirt, smiles, giving the thumbs up gesture. He's standing, shoulder to shoulder, with Nigel Farage in front of a glitzy, golden backdrop inside Trump Tower in New York. Outsiders, who faced scorn and ridicule, they stand together now as winners. To be anti-establishment now is to be mainstream. The two men, catalysts for political convulsions on both sides of the Atlantic, discussed \\"freedom and winning,\\" UKIP sources said. Their meeting was an embarrassment for Downing Street and stellar political theatre - but perhaps only that. Nigel Farage knows Mr Trump, but wields no power. The challenge for the UK government now is to build bridges with a new American administration it didn't want, and didn't expect to win. Mr Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the US at the end of 2015 led to a debate in Parliament on whether he should be barred from the UK while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, said Mr Trump must be \\"out of his mind\\". Mr Trump's spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway said Saturday's meeting between the two men in Trump Tower had been \\"very productive\\" and that they had talked about \\"freedom and winning and what all this means for the world\\". Mr Farage, who said Mr Trump \\"was relaxed, and full of good ideas\\", had joked on the way to the encounter that he was \\"just a tourist\\". A UKIP spokesman had previously confirmed that Mr Farage asked Mr Trump to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House Oval Office. Mr Farage said he had been \\"especially pleased\\" by Mr Trump's \\"very positive reaction\\" to the idea. A UKIP source said the meeting, held on 12 November, had \\"made the prime minister look very foolish\\". Mrs May plans to visit Mr Trump in the first three months of next year after his inauguration. The prime minister has said she hopes the two will be able to work on areas of mutual interest to enhance the special relationship between the two countries although some have said the government has no links with the Trump camp and will have to \\"start from scratch\\". Crispin Blunt, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, described as \\"completely implausible\\" the idea that Mr Farage would have an ambassadorial role in a Trump administration, telling the BBC there was \\"no need for Nigel\\". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he understood the appeal of Mr Trump's rhetoric to people angry at being \\"left behind\\" by globalisation but he said the president-elect needed to \\"grow up\\" when it came to his views on immigration. Mr Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, said the US economy was reliant on migrant labour and plans to build a wall on the border had caused \\"anger and outrage\\". \\"I think the treatment of Mexico by the US, just as much as the absurd, abusive language to Muslims, is something that should be challenged and has to be challenged,\\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Summary:","output":"Nigel Farage, a UK politician, met with President-elect Donald Trump. He said that Trump is a supporter of the UK and wants to be good friends with them.

Romain Grosjean finalizó décimo en su debut en IndyCar, siendo el mejor de los tres novatos. Scott McLaughlin terminó 14°, mientras que Jimmie Johnson fue 19°, generó una bandera amarilla por despite y acabó tres vueltas del líder.
