Painting: This word is essential because it refers to the subject of the sentence. A painting is a visual artwork created on a surface using colors, shapes, and textures to depict a scene, feeling, or idea. Here, it suggests that the particular art form being discussed is specifically a painted piece. 2. Building: The significance of the word \\"building\\" lies in its indication of the subject matter within the painting. A building is a man-made structure designed for various functions, such as residential, commercial, or industrial use. By mentioning that the painting shows a building, the sentence provides context to the scene displayed in the artwork. 3. Series: Lastly, \\"series\\" is an essential word to consider, as it points to a collection of works that are related or share some common elements, like a theme, art style, or creator. Here, it implies that the painting mentioned is not an isolated instance, but rather one of several artworks in a larger body of work. These three main words - \\"painting,\\" \\"building,\\" and \\"series\\" - work together to create a more detailed understanding of the sentence. They provide information on the nature of the artwork (a painting), the subject matter depicted (a building), and its context within multiple, related works (part of a series). The sentence, as a whole, highlights the creation of an artist and positions this specific painting within a more extensive collection, emphasizing the interconnectedness between the artworks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid - even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus.  Caesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\\"rule of three men\\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator.  Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor--by force of arms, if need be--a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His bodyguards had their ceremonial axes broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \\"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\\"  When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.  Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.  In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.  In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.  While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.  Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities.  While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.  During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the status quo had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.  Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.  The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters. To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed, so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.","output":"This text is about Gaius Julius Caesar, a Roman politician, military general, and author of Latin prose who played a crucial role in the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

No, it caught him by surprise, because they had paid him first. The text doesn't present any indication that Noel Johnson, the taxi driver, had any notion or suspicion towards his impending assault. The two young men, appearing well-dressed, approached him at the West Bus Station and requested his services to Cedar Grove. They even made an upfront payment to him, which, according to Johnson's account, demonstrated no hesitation on their part. This act of paying without any reluctance likely fostered an atmosphere of normalcy and trust, further reducing any potential suspicion Johnson might have had towards them. All these events point towards scenario D, where Johnson was totally taken aback by the sudden robbery. Options B and C posit that the driver anticipated the assault and had some underlying strategy in place, either to provoke them or bait them for information. The narrative doesn't provide any evidence to support these suppositions. Similarly, option A - 'None of the above choices.' is not applicable here since option D accurately fits the scenario described in the narrative.  So, based on the details mentioned in the passage, the driver was unsuspecting of the robbery due to the robbers' seemingly innocuous behavior and their payment in advance, making option D the most suitable response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Giants snapped their two-game losing streak and clinched home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs by defeating the Panthers. With the loss Carolina failed to clinch the NFC South. The Giants had already clinched a first round bye by virtue of Minnesota's loss to Atlanta earlier in the day. New York won the toss and scored on their opening drive on a 32-yard John Carney field goal. Carolina responded by scoring a touchdown on their first drive, a thirteen-yard run by DeAngelo Williams. The Giants scored on their second drive as well, going 74 yards in 13 plays and ending with a Brandon Jacobs touchdown from the Carolina 2. The Panthers responded with another Williams touchdown run, this time five yards, and a 14-10 lead. After forcing the Giants to punt Carolina scored again, as Williams scored his third touchdown of the game on a one-yard run. The drive went four plays for 65 yards, 60 of which came on a deep pass from Jake Delhomme to Muhsin Muhammad. Williams' touchdown came two plays after Steve Smith appeared to have scored on a short pass, but a replay challenge was upheld. After the teams traded punts the Giants scored with 0:55 remaining in the half as Carney added his second field goal of the game. Then on their second drive of the second half, Eli Manning threw a short touchdown to Kevin Boss to cut the deficit to 21-20 with 1:07 remaining in the third quarter. Carolina scored on their very next drive, with Williams scoring for the fourth time on a thirty-yard run. New York tied the game with 3:24 remaining as Jacobs scored on a one-yard touchdown run, after starting the drive in Panther territory. The Giants converted the two-point conversion on a pass from Manning to Domenik Hixon. Carolina then drove down the field and faced fourth and five from the Giants 32-yard line, but John Kasay missed the potential game-winning field goal from 50 yards out. On their second possession of the overtime period the Giants started at their own 13-yard line. On the first play of the drive Derrick Ward ran for 51 yards and pushed the ball into Carolina territory. Ward added a fourteen-yard run two plays later and a seventeen-yard run the play following that, pushing his rushing total to 215 yards (a career-high) and leaving the Giants two yards from the endzone. On the next play Jacobs scored on a run, his third score of the game, and New York won the game. The Giants rushed for 301 yards in the game compared to 158 for the Panthers. Jacobs added 87 yards to Ward's 215. Williams rushed for 108 yards on 24 carries, including his four touchdowns. Delhomme finished 11-19 for 185 yards and Manning 17-27 for 181 and a touchdown. Ward's 14.3-yard rushing average was a single game Giants record. Manning became the first Giants quarterback to throw at least 3,000 passing yards in a season for four consecutive seasons.

Which language is this?","output":"The phrase \\"Už se to stalo\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language, mainly spoken in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak and has similarities with other Slavic languages such as Polish, Russian, and Serbo-Croatian. Czech has a rich history, as it developed from the West Slavic dialect spoken in the region of Bohemia and Moravia during the 9th and 10th centuries. The area now known as the Czech Republic was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the influence of Latin and later German on the Czech language and culture is noticeable. In the 14th century, Czech enjoyed a golden age under the rule of Charles IV, a member of the Luxembourg dynasty. During this time, the capital city, Prague, became a hub of cultural and intellectual development. The Czech language was elevated to a written and literary language, and the first Czech translation of the Bible was produced. However, the spread of Protestantism, the Thirty Years' War, and subsequent Habsburg rule put pressure on the Czech language, leading it to become marginalized, as Latin and German occupied a more significant position. It would not be until the 18th and 19th-century Czech National Revival that the language regained its cultural and political importance, as the movement sought to revive and promote Czech language, literature, and history. Modern Czech is a member of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family and uses the Latin alphabet with several additional characters, such as ě, š, č, ř, ž, and ý. The Czech language is characterized by a complex system of inflections (morphological changes to words to indicate grammatical relationships) and has a rich vocabulary, which may include multiple synonyms with subtle differences in meaning. The phrase \\"Už se to stalo\\" can be translated into English as \\"It has already happened\\" or \\"It has happened already.\\" Czech, like other Slavic languages, is known for its flexible word order, which can sometimes lead to confusion for non-native speakers. However, this flexibility can also be used for emphasis or to create nuances in meaning. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Už se to stalo\\" is in Czech. The Czech language has a rich history, and it has undergone periods of struggle and revival throughout the years. As a Slavic language, it shares many similarities with other Slavic languages, and its complex grammar and nuanced vocabulary make it a fascinating language to study."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The maternal grandfather of Prince Carl Bernadotte was King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. Here's a detailed context about the relationship between Prince Carl Bernadotte and King Gustaf VI Adolf. Prince Carl Bernadotte, originally Prince Carl Jr. Gustaf Oscar of Sweden, was born on January 10, 1911, in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the youngest son of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland, and his wife Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. His parents, Duke Carl and Duchess Ingeborg, had four children together – Princess Margaretha, Princess Märtha, Princess Astrid, and Prince Carl Jr. As the youngest child of the family, he held the title of \\"Prince of Sweden\\" and \\"Duke of Östergötland\\" until 1937. King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, the maternal grandfather of Prince Carl Bernadotte, was born on November 11, 1882, in Stockholm, and ascended to the throne on October 29, 1950. He was the oldest son of King Gustaf V of Sweden and his wife, Queen Victoria of Baden. King Gustaf VI Adolf's daughter Princess Ingeborg, who was Prince Carl Bernadotte's mother, married Duke Carl of Västergötland, making King Gustaf VI Adolf the maternal grandfather of Prince Carl Bernadotte. In 1937, Prince Carl Bernadotte married the wealthy heiress, Countess Elsa von Rosen, which was considered unequal due to her not being of royal blood. As a result, King Gustaf V of Sweden deprived Prince Carl Jr. of his Swedish titles and his rights to succession to the Swedish throne. He then adopted the surname Bernadotte, which was the family name of the House of Bernadotte, to which the Swedish royal family belongs. After losing his titles, Prince Carl Jr. maintained a warm relationship with his relatives in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Belgium and engaged in various business ventures throughout his life. In conclusion, Prince Carl Bernadotte's maternal grandfather was King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, who was the king of Sweden from 1950 until his death in 1973. Prince Carl himself had a fascinating life that was marked by multiple marriages, the loss of his royal titles, and a number of entrepreneurial pursuits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted  the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level.  Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen? Answer:","output":"In this scenario, the currency most likely to be exchanged in the black market would be the Pound Sterling. To understand this, let's first analyze the reasons behind these economic developments in both Japan and the United Kingdom and then look into the factors that contribute to the demand for currencies in the black market. In March 2015, Japan's economy experienced a surge, raising the likelihood that the Japanese yen would appreciate in value. This could be attributed to a variety of factors, such as increased economic growth, higher exports, or the implementation of effective monetary and fiscal policies by the Japanese government. As a result, the Japanese government adjusted the price of the yen in accordance with the going market price, allowing the currency's value to increase as a reflection of the strong economic performance. On the contrary, the United Kingdom was facing an economic downturn during the same period, which could have resulted from political uncertainties, financial market instabilities, or unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, among others. This situation led to a higher likelihood of the Pound Sterling depreciating in value. However, fearing public backlash, the UK government decided to keep the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level, possibly through interventions in the foreign exchange markets. In doing so, they artificially maintained the Pound's value, despite its weakened economic fundamentals. The black market for currency exchange typically emerges when there are strict capital controls, high inflation rates, or artificial manipulation of official exchange rates. In this case, the artificial maintenance of the Pound Sterling's value by the UK government creates an opportunity for black market transactions to take place. People who possess Pounds Sterling may view the suppressed value of their currency as unfavorable, especially if they believe that the currency is overvalued or at risk of future depreciation, and they may resort to the black market to exchange it for other currencies. The Japanese yen, on the other hand, has been allowed to appreciate to reflect the current market dynamics and strong economic performance. This situation is likely to deter users from resorting to the black market for the exchange of yen, as the official market price accurately reflects the underlying economic reality. In summary, given that the UK government was keeping the price of the Pound Sterling artificially constant despite its deteriorating economic performance, it is more likely for the Pound Sterling to be exchanged in the black market compared to the Japanese yen—which had its value adjusted in accordance with its positive economic outlook. In such situations, the artificially maintained currency value encourages people to look for alternative markets for exchanging their currency to get a more favorable exchange rate, resulting in higher demand for the Pound Sterling in the black market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: At 32 years old, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is already the most dominant Arab leader in a generation. This week, he embarks on a cross-country American tour, where he'll pitch his kingdom to a skeptical U.S. public. He was named heir to the throne nine months ago by his 82-year-old father, King Salman, who granted his son vast new powers.      Known by his initials -- \\"M-B-S\\" -- his reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary. He is emancipating women, introducing music and cinema and cracking down on corruption, in a land with 15,000 princes. But selling Saudi Arabia won't be easy. In his first interview with an American television network, he was eager to discuss his country's promise and its troubled reputation head-on.      Norah O'Donnell: When many Americans think about Saudi Arabia, they think about Osama bin Laden and 9/11. They think about the terrorism that he brought to American soil.      Mohammed bin Salman: Right. Osama bin Laden recruited 15 Saudis in the 9/11 attacks with a clear objective. According to the CIA documents and Congressional investigations, Osama bin Laden wanted to create a schism between the Middle East and the West, between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America.      Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman CBS News      Norah O'Donnell: Why did Osama bin Laden wanna create that hatred between the West and Saudi Arabia?      Mohammed bin Salman: In order to create an environment conducive to recruitment and spreading his radical message that the west is plotting to destroy you. Indeed he succeeded in creating this schism in the west.      Norah O'Donnell: And how do you change that? Because it looks like what you're trying to do is change things here at home.      Mohammed bin Salman: Indeed. I believe that we have succeeded in many respects in the last three years.      We first met Prince Mohammed at the Royal Court in Riyadh. He arrived in a driving rain, a sign of good fortune in the desert kingdom. He's been called bold and visionary for his reforms at home, as well as reckless and impulsive in his rise to power. He has kicked a hornet's nest in the Middle East and earned a host of new enemies, partly why he's one of the most heavily-guarded men in the world. This is the office where he starts his days.      Norah O'Donnell: Working hard?      Mohammed bin Salman in English: Always.      He learned English from watching movies as a kid. And he's acutely aware that 70 percent of the population is like him, under the age of 35 – and getting restless.      Norah O'Donnell: What's been the biggest challenge?      Mohammed bin Salman in English: There's a lot of challenge. I think the first big challenge that we have is do the people believe in what we are doing.      Norah O'Donnell: There is a widespread perception that the kind of Islam practiced inside Arabia is harsh, it's strict, it's intolerant. Is there any truth to that?      Mohammed bin Salman: After 1979, that's true. We were victims, especially my generation that suffered from this a great deal.      The crown prince traces most of Saudi Arabia's problems to the year 1979, when the Ayatollah Khomeini established an Islamic theocracy next door in Iran. The same year, religious extremists in Saudi Arabia took over Islam's holiest site, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. In order to appease their own religious radicals, the Saudis began clamping down and segregating women from everyday life.      Norah O'Donnell: What has been this Saudi Arabia for the past 40 years? Is that the real Saudi Arabia?      Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely not. This is not the real Saudi Arabia. I would ask your viewers to use their smartphones to find out. And they can google Saudi Arabia in the 70s and 60s, and they will see the real Saudi Arabia easily in the pictures.      Norah O'Donnell: What was Saudi Arabia like before 1979?      Mohammed bin Salman: We were living a very normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries. Women were driving cars. There were movie theaters in Saudi Arabia. Women worked everywhere. We were just normal people developing like any other country in the world until the events of 1979.      Saudi women -- who've been virtually invisible in public -- have been given new rights, making it easier for them to start a business, join the military, and attend concerts and sporting events. In June, they will be able to get behind the wheel and drive.      Norah O'Donnell: Are women equal to men?      Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely. We are all human beings and there is no difference.      Norah O'Donnell: You have said you are, \\"Taking Saudi Arabia back to what we were, a moderate Islam.\\" What does that mean?      Mohammed bin Salman: We have extremists who forbid mixing between the two sexes and are unable to differentiate between a man and a woman alone together and their being together in a workplace. Many of those ideas contradict the way of life during the time of the prophet and the Caliphs. This is the real example and the true model.      He has curbed the powers of the country's so-called \\"religious police,\\" who until recently were able to arrest women for not covering up. And listen carefully to what he says is not part of Islamic Law.      Mohammed bin Salman: The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of Sharia: that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men. This, however, does not particularly specify a black abaya or a black head cover. The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear.      His words are significant, and so far, the kingdom's religious leaders are holding their tongues, and have sworn allegiance to the young prince.      Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman CBS News      Of all of the meetings he presides over every week, this is the most important: his economic council. These are the men, and a few women, trusted with re-making Saudi Arabia's \\"social pact\\" with its people. One of the crown prince's closest advisers is Mohammed al-Sheikh, a Saudi-born, Harvard-trained lawyer.      Mohammed al-Sheikh: We had a young population. And we were providing for the population, you know subsidized energy, subsidized water, subsidized medicine, subsidized education, we subsidized everybody's life.      Norah O'Donnell: And no taxes.      Mohammed al-Sheikh: And no taxes.      Norah O'Donnell: How close was Saudi Arabia to a financial crisis?      Mohammed al-Sheikh: I don't think it was extremely close, but it was heading in that direction.      Reforming the welfare state is one challenge. Another is what the crown prince calls Saudi Arabia's \\"addiction\\" to oil. The state oil company, Aramco, is valued at 2 trillion. Under the crown prince's plan, some of it will be sold off to invest in new ventures. There are concerns that the kingdom's secretive finances and dismal record on human rights may spook investors.      Norah O'Donnell: You have promised transparency and openness. But there are reports that dozens of people who have criticized your government have been arrested in the last year. They include economists, clerics, intellectuals. Is this really an open and free society?      Mohammed bin Salman: We will try to publicize as much as we can and as fast as we can, information about these individuals in order to make the world aware of what the government of Saudi Arabia is doing to combat radicalism.      Norah O'Donnell: But to answer the question about human rights abuses in this country.      Mohammed bin Salman: Saudi Arabia believes in many of the principles of human rights. In fact, we believe in the notion of human rights, but ultimately Saudi standards are not the same as American standards. I don't want to say that we don't have shortcomings. We certainly do. But naturally, we are working to mend these shortcomings.      But the crown prince has been accused of heavy-handed tactics. The most extraordinary example happened last November, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh. He invited hundreds of current and former government ministers, media moguls, prominent businessmen, and at least 11 princes to a meeting here, where they were accused of stealing from the state and were held until they either paid it back or proved their innocence.      Norah O'Donnell: I mean, what happened at the Ritz-Carlton? How did that work? You were, essentially, the Ritz-Carlton became a jail.      Mohammed bin Salman: What we did in Saudi Arabia was extremely necessary. All actions taken were in accordance with existing and published laws.      Among the detained was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal -- one of the richest men in the world. After Prince Alwaleed was detained for more than two months, the Saudis allowed a camera crew inside his room at the Ritz for a brief interview.      Prince Alwaleed: And I'd like to stay here until this thing's over completely and get out and life goes on.      Mohammed al-Sheikh said the crackdown was necessary.      Mohammed al-Sheikh: It wasn't easy. Just given the names and given the people who were involved, it really wasn't easy. But we-- we just felt that we had to do this. And and we had to do it that way.      Norah O'Donnell: What kinda corruption are we talking about? I mean, how much money was disappearing?      Mohammed al-Sheikh: Probably 5 to 10 percent of the annual spend by the government, which was roughly, I would say anywhere between 10-20 billion, maybe even more, on an annual basis.      Norah O'Donnell: So 20 billion a year is just disappearing?      Mohammed al-Sheikh: Disappearing.      There have been reports that some detainees were physically abused, and one died in custody. The Saudis told us the choice of the hotel, \\"was to maintain the respect, dignity and… comfort for those being investigated.\\"      Norah O'Donnell: Was it a power grab?      Mohammed bin Salman: If I have the power and the king has the power to take action against influential people, then you are already fundamentally strong. These are naïve accusations.      Norah O'Donnell: How much money did you get back?      Mohammed bin Salman: The amount exceeds 100 billion, but the real objective was not this amount or any other amount. The idea is not to get money, but to punish the corrupt and send a clear signal that whoever engages in corrupt deals will face the law.      Norah O'Donnell: Is this also about sending a message that, as we say in America, there's a new sheriff in town?      Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely. Absolutely.      \\"Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\\"      But while the \\"new sheriff\\" is cracking down on corruption, there are questions about his own fortune. The New York Times reports he recently purchased a yacht for a half-billion dollars, along with a French chateau.      Mohammed bin Salman: My personal life is something I'd like to keep to myself and I don't try to draw attention to it. If some newspapers want to point something out about it, that's up to them. As far as my private expenses, I'm a rich person and not a poor person. I'm not Gandhi or Mandela. I'm a member of the ruling family that existed for hundreds of years before the founding of Saudi Arabia. We own very large lots of land, and my personal life is the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago. But what I do as a person is to spend part of my personal income on charity. I spend at least 51% on people and 49 on myself.      Among the prince's official titles is \\"minister of defense.\\" And this is where his apparent fixation on Iran has led him into a quagmire in neighboring Yemen.      Mohammed bin Salman: The Iranian ideology penetrated some parts of Yemen. During that time, this militia was conducting military maneuvers right next to our borders and positioning missiles at our borders.      His response was to launch a bombing campaign that's led to a humanitarian disaster, as we reported on 60 Minutes last fall. He says Iranian-backed rebels have used the country to fire missiles at Riyadh.      Mohammed bin Salman: I can't imagine that the United States will accept one day to have a militia in Mexico launching missiles on Washington D.C., New York and LA while Americans are watching these missiles and doing nothing.      The United Nations says thousands of civilian deaths in Yemen are the direct result of Saudi airstrikes and a blockade, since lifted, of Yemen's port that temporarily stopped food and medicine from getting to hundreds of thousands of people.      Norah O'Donnell: Do you acknowledge that it has been a humanitarian catastrophe, 5,000 civilians killed and children starving there?      Mohammed bin Salman: It is truly very painful, and I hope that this militia ceases using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy from the international community. They block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and a humanitarian crisis.      Norah O'Donnell: Is what's happening in Yemen, essentially, a proxy war with Iran?      Mohammed bin Salman: Unfortunately, Iran is playing a harmful role. The Iranian regime is based on pure ideology. Many of the Al-Qaeda operatives are protected in Iran and it refuses to surrender them to justice, and continues to refuse to extradite them to the United States. This includes the son of Osama bin Laden, the new leader of Al-Qaeda. He lives in Iran and works out of Iran. He is supported by Iran.      Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with contributor Norah O'Donnell CBS News      It's worth noting that Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran both claim to represent the one true branch of Islam.      Norah O'Donnell: At its heart, what is this rift about? Is it a battle for Islam?      Mohammed bin Salman: Iran is not a rival to Saudi Arabia. Its army is not among the top five armies in the Muslim world. The Saudi economy is larger than the Iranian economy. Iran is far from being equal to Saudi Arabia.      Norah O'Donnell: But I've seen that you called the Ayatollah, Khamenei, \\"the new Hitler\\" of the Middle East.      Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely.      Norah O'Donnell: Why?      Mohammed bin Salman: Because he wants to expand. He wants to create his own project in the Middle East very much like Hitler who wanted to expand at the time. Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened. I don't want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.      Norah O'Donnell: Does Saudi Arabia need nuclear weapons to counter Iran?      Mohammed bin Salman: Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.      60 Minutes producer Harry Radliffe II CBS News      A note from 60 Minutes: Our story \\"Heir to the Throne\\" has many authors. The ten-person team that traveled to Saudi Arabia for approximately a week included correspondent Norah O'Donnell, who carried with her a long-held fascination for the region. Also on our team: producers Graham Messick and Vanessa Fica, who began working on the assignment more than two years ago at the request of the story's original producer, Harry A. Radliffe II, before he passed away of cancer at age 66.      Radliffe was 60 Minutes' resident expert on politics, religion, and history in the Middle East. Well-traveled and passionately curious, Harry would say about a 60 Minutes segment on Saudi Arabia: \\"If that ain't a story, I don't know what is.\\" Radliffe was known for taking his time with stories like this; he knew that some day, the Saudi royal family would – at long last -- give its go-ahead. Sadly, that day came after Harry's passing, but we are so glad to have carried on his vision.      Also on the team that made this story possible: associate producer Jack Weingart, Middle East producer Amjad Tadros, photographers Jonathan Partridge and Mark La Ganga, audio engineers Anton Van der Merwe and Matt Magratten, and editors Dan Glucksman and Craig Crawford. Jeff Fager, Radliffe's close friend and the executive producer of 60 Minutes, had final say over the story and personally assured two Saudi princes that we would be fair and accurate and allow the crown prince to tell his story if he let us. We are glad he did.      Saudi Arabia's 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman outmaneuvered uncles, cousins and half-brothers to become the power behind the throne of his aging father, King Salman. Since then, this royal upstart has been remaking Saudi society— out of both social and economic necessity. The vast majority of the kingdom's citizens are under 30 — connected to the world at large through their cell phones. Just as important, oil is no longer a predictable source of revenue, meaning the cradle-to-grave healthcare, education and other services that have been the birthright of every Saudi citizen, are imperiled. It's a combustible mix for a brash leader in a dangerous part of the world. But, the heir to the throne seems eager for the challenge.      Norah O'Donnell: Oh, this is where you spend all night?      Mohammed bin Salman in English: Mostly. So all of the workaholic ministers used to spend most of their nights in this, in these offices. So, I'm sorry if it's a little bit lousy.      Norah O'Donnell: This is not a lousy office.      He spends most evenings in Riyadh's Irgah Palace, where he dispenses with the traditional Saudi headscarf.      Norah O'Donnell: And so what time in the morning are you here till working?      Mohammed bin Salman in English: Oh, I come here, at, like afternoon till late night.      We're told his 82-year-old father, King Salman, is somewhere upstairs, leaving most of the day-to-day work to his son. He escorted us at 9 p.m. into a meeting about the public investment fund.      Under Prince Mohammed's detailed plan to remake Saudi Arabia – called \\"Vision 2030\\" – the public investment fund will eventually grow to 2 trillion. The men in this room are talking about how to invest it. They recently sank three and a half billion dollars into Uber. If bets like that pay off, it will be dividends, not oil revenues, pouring into the Saudi treasury.      Princess Reema: This man spend 24 hours a day working towards this vision.      Princess Reema bint Bandar is the crown prince's cousin and he chose her to lead one of the government sports authorities.      Norah O'Donnell: You were surprised by the pace with which he's doing stuff.      Princess Reema: I'm not surprised by the pace. I'm surprised by how detailed the pace is. We are not a community that's used to somebody saying, \\"Tuesday, the 5th of November, I want to see X.\\" That kind of means yes, maybe, inshallah.      Norah O'Donnell: God willing.      Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman leads a meeting CBS News      Princess Reema: There is actually a tracking system that we all monthly update. What's our progress? How have we hit our numbers? We are working and operating like a private sector. And that's new.      To a visitor, it doesn't look like that much has changed. Single men in crisp white robes and women dressed entirely in black, keep their distance from one another. Female visitors still feel obligated to wear the traditional Abaya in public… but no longer the headscarf. At this Starbucks, men sit in one section – women and families just beyond the wooden partition.      It was difficult to get people – especially women – to talk on camera about the crown prince's reforms. This man urged caution.      Abdul Rahman: I like the change that is gradual. We don't wanna move too fast and pay a heavy price.      Norah O'Donnell: In other words, you think that the crown prince has to be very careful about the pace?      Abdul Rahman: Exactly.      Saudi Arabia still adheres to an ancient power-sharing arrangement between the House of Saud and Wahhabi Islam, the strict, predominant faith in Saudi Arabia. But the crown prince told us it is not his religion, but extremists within Islamic groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, that have infiltrated Saudi society, including its schools.      Norah O'Donnell: Are you looking at the schooling and the education in Saudi Arabia?      Mohammed bin Salman: Saudi schools have been invaded by many elements from the Muslim Brotherhood organization, surely to a great extent. Even now, there are some elements left. It will be a short while until they are all eradicated completely.      Norah O'Donnell: You say you're going to eradicate this extremism in the education system here?      Mohammed bin Salman: Of course, no country in the world would accept that its educational system be invaded by any radical group.      The crown prince represents the vast majority of the Saudi people – who are overwhelmingly young, restless, and connected to just about everything through their cell phones. They see a kindred spirit in their new iPad-addicted leader.      Norah O'Donnell: Most of the young women that I met are all on Snapchat. They were asking me to join them on Snapchat. This is this is changing this entire culture.      Mohammed bin Salman: I can't claim that I played a role in this. Saudi citizens have always been open to social media and technology.      Young Saudis we talked to at this trendy pop-up burger joint say they are still careful about what they post on Twitter and Instagram, which is why members of the opposite sex connect via private messaging apps like Snapchat and Whatsapp.      Norah O'Donnell: Social media.      MALE #1: It's huge in Saudi Arabia.      MALE #2: This is our escape, yes.      Norah O'Donnell: The phone is your escape?      MALE VOICE: Yes. Social media is.      The crown prince has more pressing concerns, only 22 percent of Saudi women work, and he wants to encourage more to join the workforce.      Mohammed bin Salman: We are working on an initiative, which we will launch in the near future, to introduce regulations ensuring equal pay for men and women.      Norah O'Donnell: But you're talking about equal pay. Women can't even drive in this country. This is the last, last place in the world that women don't have the rights to drive.      Mohammed bin Salman: This is no longer an issue. Today, driving schools have been established and will open soon. In a few months, women will drive in Saudi Arabia. We are finally over that painful period that we cannot justify.      Norah O'Donnell: Certainly, most people hear about the rule that will allow women to drive in June. But there have also existed these guardianship laws that, in order to travel, a woman has to get the permission of a male in her household. It seems so throwback.      Mohammed bin Salman: Today, Saudi women still have not received their full rights. There are rights stipulated in Islam that they still don't have. We have come a very long way and have a short way to go.      He wanted us to see this driving school, at Princess Nourah University, the largest all women's university in the world. The school is preparing to teach 70,000 women how to drive.      These trainers will put women through classes and simulators before having them hit the road.      Norah O'Donnell: How do you get to work or school now?      WOMAN #1: For me, I have a driver. Or, like, my dad or my brother.      WOMAN #2: Driving is just a quick win. It's not everything. It's just representative that we're going in the right direction. It's progress. The trajectory now is just going forward and not backwards.      Norah O'Donnell: You are witnessing history?      WOMEN: (OVERTALK) Yes. Exactly. We are glad to be part of this history.      Princess Reema is also helping make history – she recently opened the gates for Saudi women to attend soccer matches.      Norah O'Donnell: I mean, it was just in 2015 that a Saudi woman was arrested trying to go to a game.      Princess Reema: Yes. Yes. And you know what? I'm proud to say that I was at the first game where that's no longer a reality. How sensational is that to say in two years? In two years the arc has changed.      Norah O'Donnell: People have asked me for my impressions and there's so much that's modern, in terms of infrastructure and American restaurants. But it is still interesting to see that single men eat in one part of the restaurant. And families and women in another.      Princess Reema: Correct.      Norah O'Donnell: It's segregated.      Princess Reema: It is viewed here as the preservation of the privacy of the personal space of the woman. If it comes out to being viewed internationally as disrespectful, that's not the intention. Does it end up sometimes causing obstacles? Yes. But the intent is not disrespect.      Norah O'Donnell: Do you think Mohammed bin Salman is prepared to take the throne?      Princess Reema: I don't think anyone is ever prepared. I think since he was 18 years old he has been groomed for leadership.      His ascension would mark a generational power shift. It was his grandfather, King Abdulaziz, who founded modern Saudi Arabia, and was succeeded by six sons, including the current king, King Salman. The crown prince grew up by his father's side, learning and biding his time.      Norah O'Donnell: What did you learn from your father?      Mohammed bin Salman: Many, many things. He loves history very much. He is an avid reader of history. Each week, he would assign each one of us a book. And at the end of the week, he would ask us about the content of that book. The king always says, \\"If you read the history of a thousand years, you have the experience of a thousand years.\\"      Mohammed bin Salman is trying to keep pace with a population that's become as familiar with American celebrity culture as they are with the tales of the Prophet Muhammad in the birthplace of Islam. Just as American society transformed during the 1960's, the Saudis are in the midst of their own cultural revolution. The kingdom, the Middle East, and the Islamic world may never be the same.      Norah O'Donnell: You're 32 years old. You could rule this country for the next 50 years.      Mohammed bin Salman: Only God knows how long one will live, if one would live 50 years or not, but if things go their normal ways, then that's to be expected.      Norah O'Donnell: Can anything stop you?      Mohammed bin Salman: Only death.      Produced by Graham Messick and Vanessa Fica.

His ongoing PR campaign seeks to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy and reset its image abroad, but some of his actions have undermined that goal.      MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:      Now it's time for our regular segment Words You'll Hear. That's where we take a look at a word or phrase that will be in the news and tell you why it's important. Today's words are actually a name - Mohammed bin Salman. He's Saudi Arabia's 32-year-old crown prince. He's heading to the U.S. this week. The controversial young prince is next in line for the throne, and now he's set for a cross-country U.S. tour. NPR's Deborah Amos is with us now to talk about the crown prince's visit, where he's going and what he's going to be doing while he's there. Deb, thanks so much for joining us.      DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: Thank you.      MARTIN: So why is he here?      AMOS: Well, this is a cross-country PR tour. You know, he wants to reset Saudi Arabia's image. And it's also an investment tour. So that's why he's meeting with Apple, Microsoft, Uber, Google, Facebook, movie moguls in Los Angeles. He needs Western investment to diversify the Saudi economy. Now, this country - and the whole region - has historically relied on oil. Prices are dropping. Saudi Arabia is reeling. This young prince has ridden in a Tesla, and he can see the future.      MARTIN: So he's selling a new image of the kingdom, but has anything changed?      AMOS: You know, he amassed power quickly. His father is the king, so he could do that. He is viewed as a reformer at home. The ban on women driving ends this. Summer women can now join the military, open businesses, go to sporting events. There's a new entertainment industry that's opening.      He also cracked down on the religious police. And these are the guys who enforce attendance at prayers and enforce the strict public dress code. But he's also in other ways stumbled. He ordered the detention of more than 300 businessmen, former Cabinet officials and royals, in a corruption crackdown. They all got imprisoned in a five-star hotel. Investors on the outside said it looked more like a shakedown to them because these guys had to agree to give back billions of dollars before they could get out of the hotel.      Popular in the kingdom, not so popular with investors. That's part of the reason that he's here. He's also raised eyebrows with personal spending - a 440-foot yacht, a French chateau, a Da Vinci. Those are his reported purchases. And then there's Yemen. He was the defense minister when Saudi decided to side in that civil war. And he's going to have a tough sell in Congress. They want the U.S. to stop supporting that war.      MARTIN: Well, to that end, though, what kind of reception can he expect here in the U.S.?      AMOS: He's going to get a warm one at the White House. He has been working with Jared Kushner since shortly after the election but tougher in Congress because of Yemen. And a tougher audience still will be investors. This is the first time the Saudis are here to sell their own image. You know, the relationship has always been Washington to Riyadh. Now he is laser-focused on the economy, so he has a new audience to convince.      MARTIN: I'm asking you to speculate a bit here, Deb, but what are the chances that he actually can change one of the most-conservative societies in the world?      AMOS: That is the 64 million - or billion these days - dollar question. He has to because the kingdom faces a disaster if he can't because of the economy. He is no Jeffersonian Democrat, be sure of that. There has been, along with these reforms, a crackdown in the kingdom. So this is the biggest economy in the region. Saudi Arabia's stability is important to the United States. So what many analysts are saying is let us wish him well.      MARTIN: That's NPR's Deborah Amos. Deb, thank you.      AMOS: Thank you.      Copyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Read this: The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Chinese troops attacked the UN forces when they crossed what ocean?","output":"Chinese troops attacked the UN forces when they crossed the Yalu River, not an ocean.

Fact4: Madhu has been misappropriating company funds with the help of Manorama. Fact5: Bombay to seek new avenues. Story (Output): Raja was a petty thief living on the streets of Bombay, where he relied on his skills to survive in the bustling city. He spent his days pickpocketing unsuspecting tourists and locals, while his nights were spent dreaming of something bigger. In the same city, Rani made her living as a street performer. She had always been attracted to the vibrant energy of Bombay and loved the way it made her feel alive. As both of them struggled to make ends meet, fate brought them together on a crowded street corner. Little did they know, their lives were about to change forever. Meanwhile, in the city of Madras, Raghu lived a simple life with his wife and children. He worked at a small yet prosperous company that provided for his family. Although he was far away from the chaotic world of Bombay, the ties that bound Raja, Rani, and Raghu were stronger than they could have ever imagined. Back in Bombay, Madhu, one of the employees at Raghu's company, had been misappropriating company funds with the help of her colleague, Manorama. Through an intricate web of deceit and corruption, they managed to steal substantial sums of money without being caught. The stolen money provided them with the means to live a luxurious lifestyle in Bombay, away from the prying eyes of their coworkers in Madras. Unbeknownst to them, Raja's thieving skills ultimately led him to cross paths with Madhu and Manorama. One fateful day, as he was attempting to steal a valuable artifact from an antique store, he stumbled upon information that revealed the money laundering operation. Caught between the desire to enrich himself or expose the nefarious activities, Raja decided to approach Rani for guidance. Together, they decided that the ugly truth must come to light. Raja and Rani set off on a journey to Bombay's underbelly, seeking new avenues to bring down Madhu and Manorama's criminal empire. As they navigated the dark and dangerous streets, their partnership developed into a deep bond that withstood the challenges they faced. With perseverance, courage, and a little luck, Raja and Rani were successful in their pursuit. Madhu and Manorama were brought to justice, and Raghu's company was saved from the brink of collapse. Through his act of bravery, Raja redeemed himself, leaving his old life of thievery behind. The heartwarming tale of Raja, Rani, and Raghu serves as a testament to the power of second chances and the beauty of forging unexpected connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the process that ultimately leads to cooling of the body through sweating is the detection of an increase in body temperature by the brain's thermoregulatory center, specifically the hypothalamus.  When the body temperature rises due to factors such as physical exertion, exposure to high ambient temperature, or even consuming spicy foods, the thermoreceptors present throughout the body, especially on the skin surface, detect the change in temperature. This information is then relayed to the hypothalamus, a region in the brain responsible for various bodily functions, including regulation of body temperature. As a response to the detected temperature increase, the hypothalamus activates its heat dissipation mechanisms to maintain the core body temperature within an optimal range (approximately 37°C/98.6°F). One such mechanism involves sending signals to the blood vessels in the skin layers, particularly those near the surface. This signal causes the blood vessels to dilate (vasodilation), which allows increased blood flow to the skin. Consequently, the heat from the blood can be more easily transferred to the surrounding environment. Simultaneously, the hypothalamus also activates the eccrine sweat glands distributed throughout the body. These glands produce sweat, a mixture of water, salts, and other minerals that are secreted onto the skin through the pores. As sweat is released, it evaporates from the skin surface, which requires the absorption of heat energy. This process of evaporation facilitates cooling of the skin and the body in general, helping to maintain a steady core body temperature. In summary, the first step of the process is the detection of an increase in body temperature by the brain's thermoregulatory center, mainly the hypothalamus, which then triggers the body's heat dissipation mechanisms such as vasodilation and activation of sweat glands, leading to cooling of the body through the release and evaporation of sweat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other...

Question: The person who started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses had what calling? Context: Martin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517. The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter's Basilica in 1514.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  and a hint : Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  Please answer this question : Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Answer:","output":"Sean read more about a greater frequency of collisions. This is because he studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, and the provided hint indicates that raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction due to an increase in the frequency of collisions.

Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics have usually given the Hexapoda the rank of superclass,:180 and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group).

Output:","output":"In this task, you are asked to analyze two given sentences and determine if they convey the same meaning or not. If they have the same meaning, you should classify them as \\"Yes\\", but if they don't, you should classify them as \\"No\\". To complete this task, follow these steps: 1. Read both of the given sentences carefully. 2. Identify the main subject(s), verb(s), and object(s) in each sentence. 3. Determine if they are conveying the same idea or message. 4. If the sentences share the same meaning, classify them as \\"Yes\\". 5. If the sentences have different meanings, classify them as \\"No\\". In this example, the sentences are: Sentence-1: I love to walk her as the sun is setting. Sentence-2: I like to take walks with my dog. Now let's break down each sentence: 1. Sentence-1: The main subject is \\"I\\", verb is \\"love to walk\\", and the object is \\"her\\". The action is taking place \\"as the sun is setting\\". 2. Sentence-2: The main subject is \\"I\\", verb is \\"like to take walks\\", and the object is \\"my dog\\". Comparing the meanings of the two sentences: 1. Both sentences have the same subject, \\"I\\". 2. The actions are similar, involving walking or taking walks. 3. The objects of the sentences are different, implying \\"her\\" and \\"my dog\\", but it's likely that \\"her\\" is referring to the dog.  However, there is a difference in the time during which the action takes place, as only the first sentence mentions \\"as the sun is setting.\\"  With this information, it's not entirely clear if the sentences have the same meaning or not because of the time difference aspect. But since the main focus is on walking the dog, you could classify these sentences as \\"Yes\\" if you think they convey the same basic idea of walking the dog. Alternatively, you could classify them as \\"No\\" if you believe the time aspect creates a significant distinction between their meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Greek cuisine is characteristic of the healthy Mediterranean diet, which is epitomized by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as moussaka, stifado, Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, retsina (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish. Question: What is a characteristic of the Mediterranean diet?","output":"A characteristic of the Mediterranean diet is its emphasis on consuming a diverse array of fresh, wholesome, and nutrient-dense foods that promote overall health and well-being. This diet is predominantly plant-based, featuring a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. It also includes moderate amounts of lean meats, such as fish and poultry, while limiting the consumption of red meats, processed foods, and added sugars. Another distinctive feature of the Mediterranean diet is the regular use of olive oil, which is known for its health benefits and heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. This oil often replaces other less healthy fats like butter and margarine in cooking and dressing dishes. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet encourages the consumption of foods rich in healthy fats, such as fish, nuts, and seeds, which are good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids, and it highly values the inclusion of fresh herbs and spices, as they not only enhance the flavors of the dishes, but also provide various health benefits as well. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet recognizes the important role that moderate consumption of red wine plays in promoting heart health, as it contains antioxidants and polyphenols that can be beneficial for cardiovascular health. A key aspect of the Mediterranean diet is the focus on enjoying foods in a social setting. Sharing meals with family and friends is considered an integral part of the diet, which allows for a deeper appreciation and nurturing of relationships through food. In summary, a characteristic of the Mediterranean diet is its focus on whole, unprocessed, and nutrient-rich foods, with an emphasis on plant-based ingredients, healthy fats, and moderate consumption of lean meats and red wine. This diet promotes overall health and well-being, while also highlighting the importance of social connections and shared meals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's difficult to look back on one's own childhood without some element of nostalgia .I have four brothers and sisters, and my memories are all about being with them.Playing board games on the living room floor, or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children, racing up and down on our bikes, or exploring the nearby woods.My parents scarcely appear in these memories, except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure. These days, in the UK at least, the nature of childhood has changed dramatically.Firstly, families are smaller, and there are far more only children.It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn't time to bring up a large family, or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child.As a result, today's boys and girls spend much of their time alone.Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home, inside.More than anything this is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers, so they wouldn't dream of letting their children play outside by themselves. Finally, the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different.Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood.The irony  is that so many ways of playing games are called \\"interactive\\".The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today. Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had? I personally believe that they do, but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same.

A:","output":"Apart from the laws of motion and universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton made several crucial discoveries and contributions in various fields. Some of his significant accomplishments include: 1. The invention of Calculus: Newton developed a form of mathematics called \\"fluxions\\" (Calculus), which deals with rates of change and the slopes of curves. 2. Discovering the nature of light and color: Newton conducted several experiments with prisms and demonstrated that white light is made of a spectrum of colors, which led to the development of the field of optics. 3. Reflecting Telescope: He invented the Newtonian telescope, also known as the reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors instead of lenses, resulting in a more precise and less distorted image of celestial objects. 4. Laws of Motion: Newton established three fundamental laws of motion, which became the foundation for classical mechanics. 5. The Universal Law of Gravitation: Newton discovered that every object with mass attracts every other object, with the force of attraction proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 6. Contributions to Fluid Mechanics: Newton's principles and equations were applied to fluid mechanics, which deal with the behavior of both fluid at rest and in motion. 7. Mathematization of Science: Newton's work in Principia Mathematica revolutionized the world's approach to scientific investigation, applying mathematical reasoning to fields ranging from physics to astronomy.

Please answer the following question: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course.  They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  In which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster? A:","output":"In Justin's reaction. Step 1: Understand the situation In this scenario, Justin is conducting reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas is conducting his reactions at a lower temperature. Step 2: Recall the effect of temperature on reaction rates As stated in the text, when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. This leads to more collisions between particles and a higher likelihood of reacting with greater force. Step 3: Apply knowledge to the given scenario Since Justin is conducting his reactions at a high temperature, the particles of the acid and base in his experiment will have more energy and move faster. In contrast, the particles in Thomas's reaction will have less energy and move slower due to the lower temperature. Step 4: Conclude Based on this information, the acid and base particles will move faster in Justin's reaction.

Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life.     Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey.  Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel.   It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel.    Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness;  when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents and Uncle Jack – firmly in Quincey's life.   Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life.

Summarize this article: Wider use of anti-retroviral drugs has helped to stop a sharper rise, a study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and a number of universities found. They found a 26% rise, from 1990-2010, in the proportion of men who have sex with men who did not use condoms. The report said the figures showed it was vital to promote safe sex. Rates of HIV have been rising in recent years with latest figures showing cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK reaching an all-time high. A recent report from the HPA found that nearly half of the 6,280 people diagnosed in the UK in 2011 were MSM. Overall, one in 20 MSM are infected with HIV. Darren, Greater Manchester, writes: \\"I suspect the rise is more among young MSMs. \\"They see HIV positive men like myself and think it is just a matter of popping a few pills if they catch it, so they are not that phased about becoming HIV positive or not using condoms. \\"There also seem to be more bisexual men or curious men around now who are used to not bothering with condoms with heterosexual encounters so prefer not to use them elsewhere too. \\"When I do have sex I tend to use condoms as there are worse things you can get like Hepatitis C or an alternative strain of HIV which can reduce your highly active antiretroviral therapy drug pool.\\" For this study, researchers analysed data from 1990 to 2010. They concluded that, without the introduction of anti-retroviral drugs to treat those with HIV, infections would be 68% higher in MSM. Therapy with anti-retrovirals lowers the risk of people with HIV infecting others. The report suggested the incidence of HIV could be 32% lower if all anti-retroviral treatment were prescribed from the moment of diagnosis rather than when health declined. Further analysis showed that, if all MSM had stopped using condoms from 2000, rates of HIV in this group would now be 400% higher, the journal PLoS One reported. The data also showed that the incidence of HIV could have dropped by a quarter if more HIV testing had been done. But the researchers said the results showed that even a modest increase in unprotected sex was enough to erode the benefits of other interventions. Study leader Professor Andrew Phillips, from University College London, said: \\"By better understanding the driving forces behind the trends we've seen in the past, it will allow us to make informed choices to reduce new HIV infections in the future.\\" Co-author Dr Valerie Delpech, who is head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: \\"Everyone should use a condom when having sex with new or casual partners, until all partners have had a sexual health screen. \\"We also encourage men who have sex with men to get an HIV and STI screen at least annually, and every three months if having condomless sex with new or casual partners - and clinicians to take every opportunity to recommend HIV testing to this group.\\" Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said condom use by gay men had played a key part in containing the spread of HIV in the UK. \\"Without it, there would have been 80,000 more gay men with HIV between 2000 and 2010.\\" He added that the study showed the impact of the combined HIV strategy of promoting condoms, increasing regular HIV testing and encouraging the earlier use of anti-HIV drug therapy. He added: \\"At a time when funding for local HIV prevention programmes is under threat, this only reinforces the important role which local authorities can and must play in funding local HIV prevention.\\"","output":"A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and various universities has found that rates of HIV have been rising in recent years, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK.

It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing  ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question. Sleeping binge Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \\" catch up\\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \\" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep banking Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset   upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead. Routine  naps A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \\" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy  , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \\" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \\" The body likes routine,\\" he says, \\" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\\" Question: From Monday to Friday, many people   _  .

Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. After the Police disbanded, Copeland established a career composing soundtracks for movies (Airborne, Talk Radio, Wall Street, Riff Raff, Raining Stones, Surviving the Game, See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Highlander II: The Quickening, The Leopard Son, She's Having a Baby, The First Power, Fresh, Taking Care of Business, West Beirut, I am David, Good Burger), television (The Equalizer, Dead Like Me, Star Wars: Droids, the pilot for Babylon 5 (1993), Nickelodeon's The Amanda Show, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee), operas (Holy Blood and Crescent Moon, commissioned by Cleveland Opera) and ballets (Prey' Ballet Oklahoma, Casque of Amontillado, Noah's Ark/Solcheeka, commissioned by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, King Lear, commissioned by the San Francisco Ballet Company, Emilio).  Copeland also occasionally played drums for other artists. Peter Gabriel employed Copeland to perform on his songs \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Big Time\\" from his 1986 album So. He has also performed with Mike Rutherford and Tom Waits. That year he also teamed with Adam Ant to record the title track and video for the Anthony Michael Hall movie Out of Bounds. In 1989, Copeland formed Animal Logic with jazz bassist Stanley Clarke and singer-songwriter Deborah Holland. The trio had success with their first album and world tour but the follow-up recording sold poorly, and the band did not continue.  In 1993 he composed the music for Channel 4's Horse Opera and director Bob Baldwin.

And the answer is...","output":"We have the equation: -24615*i - 393015 = 2585400 Our goal is to solve the equation for i, which is an unknown variable. Here's how we can do that: 1. Firstly, isolate the term containing the variable i. To do this, we'll move the constant term on the left side of the equation to the right side. We can do this by adding 393015 to both sides of the equation: -24615*i = 2585400 + 393015 2. Now, simplify the equation by performing the operation on the right side: -24615*i = 2978415 3. Next, to solve for i, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -24615: i = 2978415 / -24615 4. Perform the division: i ≈ -121 Thus, the solution to the equation -24615*i - 393015 = 2585400 is i ≈ -121."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty   by micro-credits. These very small loans  , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15... Question: Bank loans are mainly made to women because   _  .

Facebook warns developers after privacy leak \\"We take strong measures to enforce this policy, including suspending and disabling applications that violate it.\\" A report by The Wall Street Journal found that some of Facebook's most popular apps, including the game FarmVille by social network game company Zynga, were being used to share users' personal information with more than 25 advertisers and online tracking companies. According to the Journal, the apps were sharing the unique \\"Facebook ID\\" numbers that are assigned to every user on the site and can be used to look up a person's name -- even if that person has set all of his or her Facebook information to be private. The report said Rapleaf, a data gathering firm, was able to link information from the apps to its database of internet users, which could allow advertisers to create user profiles based on online information about the users. In a blog post Monday, Rapleaf said sharing personal identifiers was a mistake. When informed of it last week, the company \\"immediately researched the cause and implemented a solution to cease the transmissions,\\" the post said. It also stated that as of last week, no user IDs, or UIDs, were being shared via Rapleaf. \\"We are committed to working with the industry to fix these issues, and all issues that may emerge in the future from this complex ecosystem,\\" said the post. \\"Our mission is that everyone can have a personalized experience on the web that is safe and anonymous, and we will continue to work hard to make this a reality.\\" A user ID is a public part of any Facebook user's profile and can be used by any third party to access information the user has made public.

Which US state in 1907 was the last to declare Christmas a legal holiday?","output":"Oklahoma was the last US state to declare Christmas a legal holiday in 1907. This decision was made over three decades after it became a federally recognized holiday in the United States. Prior to its declaration as a legal holiday, religious observance of Christmas was widespread in the United States and celebrated in various ways across households. The first time Christmas was designated as a federal holiday, however, came on June 26, 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant signed legislation which included Christmas as one of five officially recognized national holidays, alongside New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day, and George Washington's Birthday. Before the late 19th century, Christmas was not a legal holiday in all US states. In some cases, celebrating Christmas was even frowned upon for cultural, religious, or historical reasons. For instance, the early Puritans did not approve of the celebration of Christmas, considering it a decadent holiday with pagan roots. As a result, Christmas was not widely celebrated in New England for many years. Over time, the popularity of Christmas festivities grew, and various states began to recognize it as a legal holiday throughout the 19th century. By the mid-to-late 1800s, virtually all US states had made Christmas a legal holiday. Oklahoma was the only exception until it joined the Union as the 46th state on November 16, 1907, and subsequently declared Christmas an official state holiday in the same year. It is important to note that the proclamation of Christmas as a legal holiday did not have a significant impact on the overall festivities or religious observance of the celebrations in Oklahoma, as residents had been informally celebrating the holiday in their personal lives for many years. Declaring Christmas a legal holiday in Oklahoma ensured that it was recognized officially and granted employees the day off to celebrate it with their families. This was a reflection of the growing importance and popularity of Christmas across the United States as a time for family gathering, religious observance, and festive celebration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\"  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why might Malaysia not suffer the kinds of natural disasters experienced in Indonesia and the Philippines?\\" is \\"Planning and preparedness\\"?

In hydraulic elevator systems, emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as \\"soft-start\\" contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern. Once the passengers have exited, what happens?","output":"Once the passengers have exited the hydraulic elevator during an emergency situation, the following steps occur: 1. Doors close: After the adjustable time period has passed, the elevator doors close automatically to secure the elevator cabin and prevent unauthorized access or further use. 2. Elevator remains unusable: The elevator is then placed in an unusable state, to minimize any risks or further complications that may arise from continued operation during the emergency. 3. Resetting the elevator: In order to reuse the elevator, it typically needs to be reset by authorized personnel. Usually, this involves cycling the elevator main power switch off and then on again, which reboots the elevator control system and restores it to normal operation. 4. Inspection and maintenance: After the reset, it is essential to conduct a thorough inspection of the elevator to ensure its safe functionality. This may include checking various components such as the hydraulic pump, motor, valves, and electrical connections, as well as testing the elevator's operation to confirm its proper functioning. 5. Resuming normal operation: If the inspection determines that the elevator is safe to operate and no further maintenance is required, the elevator can resume normal operation. However, if any issues are identified during the inspection, they must be addressed and repaired before the elevator is allowed to operate again. This may involve replacing or repairing damaged components, updating software, or recalibrating the system. By following these steps, the hydraulic elevator ensures the safety of its passengers and maintains proper functionality after an emergency situation. Additionally, this process helps in preventing any further complications or potential hazards from arising due to continued operation during an emergency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Jean Auguste Margueritte (15 January 1823  6 September 1870), French General, father of Victor Margueritte and Paul Margueritte.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\".  - French Algeria (to 1839, then ' afterward; unofficially ', , ') began in 1827 with the blockade of Algiers by the French navy and lasted from 1830 to 1962, under a variety of governmental systems. From 1848 until independence, the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria was administered as an integral part of France. The vast arid interior of Algeria, like the rest of French North Africa, was never considered part of France. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants, known as ' and later, as '. However, indigenous Muslims remained a majority of the territory's population throughout its history. Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population with its lack of political and economic status fueled calls for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum.  - Paul Margueritte ( 20 February 1860 -- 29 December 1918 ) was born in French Algeria , the son of General Jean Auguste Margueritte ( 1823 -- 1870 ) , who was mortally wounded in the Battle of Sedan . An account of his life was published by Paul Margueritte as Mon père ( 1884 ; enlarged ed. , 1897 ) . Paul 's name is generally associated with that of his brother , Victor , because of their frequent collaboration . Paul Margueritte , who has given a picture of his home in Algiers in Le Jardin du passé ( 1895 ) , was sent to the military school of La Flèche for the sons of officers , and became in 1880 clerk to the minister of public instruction . He was an amateur mime and wrote several pantomimes , most notably Pierrot assassin de sa femme ( Théâtre de Valvins , 1881 ) and , in collaboration with Fernand Beissier , Colombine pardonnée ( Cercle Funambulesque , 1888 ) .  - Victor Margueritte (1 December 1866  23 March 1942) and his brother Paul Margueritte (18601918), French novelists, both born in Algeria, were the sons of General Jean Auguste Margueritte (18231870), who after an honorable career in Algeria was mortally wounded in the great cavalry charge at Sedan and died in Belgium on 6 September 1870. An account of his life was published by Paul Margueritte as \\"Mon père\\" (1884; enlarged ed., 1897). The names of the two brothers are generally associated, on account of their collaboration.  - The Battle of Sedan was fought during the FrancoPrussian War on 1 September 1870. It resulted in the capture of Emperor Napoleon III and large numbers of his troops and for all intents and purposes decided the war in favour of Prussia and its allies, though fighting continued under a new French government.    'paul margueritte' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'brother'?  Choices: - muhammad  - napoleon iii  - paris  - paul margueritte  - victor margueritte The answer to this question is:","output":"Victor Margueritte is related to Paul Margueritte through the relation of 'brother'. The two brothers were both French novelists born in Algeria and the sons of General Jean Auguste Margueritte.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the story ends, what do you think readers purchase?

Given the question: What was the name of Sir John Baker's daughter?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

Manisha Koirala (born 16 August 1970) is a Nepali actress who mainly appears in Hindi films in India, though she has worked in several South Indian and her native country's films. Noted for her acting prowess, Koirala is the recipient of several accolades, including four Filmfare Awards--and is one of India's most well-known actresses. Although the box-office collections from her films have varied considerably, critics have noted that her niche as an actor remains unharmed irrespective of her commercial potency. She was one of the highest paid actresses in the 1990s. She starred in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's love saga 1942: A Love Story (1994) and Mani Ratnam's Tamil drama Bombay (1995).  Her performance in the film Bombay was a milestone in her career which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actress and Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance. She was seriously noticed by Bollywood after the release of 1942: A Love Story which was a year earlier than the release of Bombay. She also starred in Mansoor Khan's romantic musical Akele Hum Akele Tum (1995) as the ignored wife who leaves her husband and child to fulfill her singing talent and subsequently becomes a popular star. In 1996, she received positive reviews for her performance in the drama Agni Sakshi, as a battered wife on the run from her mentally ill husband. The film became one of the biggest hits of that year at the Indian box office. Later that year, she acted in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directorial debut Khamoshi: The Musical, where she played the role of Annie, a caring daughter to deaf and mute parents.  A critic from Channel 4 wrote: \\"Koirala... demonstrates the full range of her acting ability, rather than playing against it as she has had to do in more traditional films. The scene where she shouts at her father through the door, screaming and using sign language even though she knows he can neither see nor hear her, is extremely powerful.\\" Filmfare magazine later included her performance in the film on its \\"80 Iconic Performances\\" list.

The answer should be","output":"option 4, where the man dips his shovel into snow and begins shoveling on the side. This choice seems the most plausible and coherent continuation of the story. As the man is already engaged in the task of removing snow from his car, it is natural for him to progress to clearing the surrounding area with his shovel. This would not only make the task of accessing his car easier, but also create a safe path for him to walk on, preventing potential slip and fall accidents. In contrast, the other options seem less relevant or logical in the context of the given story. In option 1, although the man speaking to the camera might provide an opportunity to introduce some background information or context, it does not directly relate to the task at hand and could potentially break the flow of the narrative. Option 2 presents an unrealistic scenario – pushing another car in a snowy area would require significant strength and adherence to safety precautions, and it is unclear how this action would contribute to the overall storyline. Option 3 contains a confusing phrase – \\"cutting up the snow walking into the car\\" – and does not provide a clear and reasonable continuation of the story. Thus, the best choice is option 4, as it not only makes sense given the context but also allows for a smooth and coherent narrative progression. The man, determined to free his car and the surrounding area from the snow, dips his shovel into the snow and starts shoveling on the side, his breath visible in the frigid air.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger.

Chris Christie  said Tuesday that New Jersey needed \\"tough and plain-spoken leadership\\" when  he  took office eight years ago and  he  delivered it  pulling the state from \\"the brink of financial ruin\\" by confronting problems leaders of both parties had ignored for decades.  Christie  hands over state government to Democrat Phil Murphy in a week.  Christie  said  he  was the first governor in America to try to tackle the huge and escalating burden of state pension costs  saying previous governors from both parties and Legislatures \\"virtually ignored the growing menace of increased costs and no real contributions.\\" Among the steps taken during  his  administration was dedicating lottery proceeds to the pension system for the next 30 years. When  he  took office   Christie  said  New Jersey was \\"on the brink of financial ruin as a state.\\" \\"We needed tough and plain-spoken leadership to deal with these problems \\"  he  said.  He  said  he  vetoed more than 7 billion in spending  helped cut the state workforce  pushed through a cap on property tax increases and  at the same time  made sure the state invested heavily to help protect the New Jersey Shore from the kind of devastation it suffered during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

He  also was exceedingly popular and widely praised for guiding the state in its recovery from Superstorm Sandy  which ravaged the coastline.  He  was briefly seen as a top GOP contender for president. But  he  was also criticized for testy exchanges with the public during town hall meetings and other encounters.  His  popularity and job approval fell sharply  particularly after the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal in which three of  his  allies were convicted in a political retribution scheme.  He  also lost the home crowd after spending much of 2015 and early 2016 campaigning for president out of state  a contest  he  dropped out of after failing to emerge from the back of the pack.  He  returned to New Jersey and focused on the state's â and country's â opioid addiction crisis after failing to get a top job in the Trump administration.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A pair of Blue Rams will do best in a tank that is at least 10 gallons. If you add other fish or other cichlid pairs, then you’ll need to go up to at least 20 gallons. Disregard everything you’ve heard about the one gallon of water per inch of fish rule, it’s simply outdated and extremely flawed.  Remember that German Blue Ram Cichlids can grow to be 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) at maturity. Overcrowding is not a problem to be taken lightly. It can stress your fish out, making them more prone to illness. It can also lead to increased aggressiveness and even starvation. Rams are accustomed to the tropical waters of Venezuela and Colombia, right near the equator. The areas they occupy are shallow with minimal cover, and they require consistent water temperatures of at least 80 degrees, with 82-86 being optimal. A heater can be used to regulate your tanks temperature. An aquarium light improves tank visibility. Many people choose to purchase an aquarium hood that includes a built-in light and heater. Whatever lighting setup you choose, German Blue Ram Cichlids do best with light during the daytime. 6-8 hours of light a day is plenty; any more than that and you may run into algae problems. This is the base material that covers the floor of your tank. Blue Rams prefer sand or gravel, as they mirror a Ram’s natural habitat. Make sure to rinse your substrate out before adding, otherwise it will make your tank appear murky. Add at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand or gravel at the bottom of the tank and spread it out evenly. Blue Rams do best in a complex habitat with a number of good hiding spaces. Be sure to include plants, rocks, caves, and driftwood in your tank. These items will make water changes more of a hassle, but will improve the health of your cichlids in the long term.  Place larger plants on the outer perimeter of the tank. Make sure to leave swimming space in between and an open area in the middle of the tank. The Dwarf Amazon Sword and Brazilian Water Ivy are two plants that Blue Rams enjoy.  A good selection of driftwood pieces can help regulate the pH level, provide great hiding spaces, and serve as a plant anchor. Make sure to buy your driftwood from a pet store, as this will ensure that is safe for aquarium use. You may notice some water yellowing after adding driftwood, this is perfectly normal and can be remedied via regular water changes.","output":"This article provides guidance on setting up an optimal aquarium environment for German Blue Ram Cichlids, including recommended tank size, substrate, lighting, temperature, plants, driftwood, and how to avoid overcrowding and stress for healthy fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Man of the match Harry Kane hailed one of the 'greatest moments' in his fledgling Tottenham career after helping his side snatch a 2-1 comeback victory over 10-man Aston Villa with a late winner at Villa Park. Villa's five-game and 15-minute wait for a goal ended when Andreas Weimann opened the scoring following a spell of dominance from the hosts as he collected Charles N'Zogbia's cross to slot home from close range. Tempers flared for the second time in little over five minutes after the hour mark and Christian Benteke was shown a straight red card by referee Neil Swarbrick after a tussle with Erik Lamela in which the Belgium international raised his hand to his opponent's face.

Andreas Weimann, Charles N'Zogbia, Christian Benteke, and Erik Lamela are individual players representing each team, so it doesn't make sense for their fans to be celebrating with the Spurs players. 2. Aston Villa and Villa Park fans are essentially the same, and they wouldn't celebrate since their team lost the match. 3. Belgium fans are not specifically mentioned, and it's not a match between countries, so there would be no reason for them to celebrate with Spurs players. 4. Mauricio Pochettino is a manager, so it's unusual for his fans to be mentioned separately. 5. Neil Swarbrick is a referee, and referees don’t usually have fans celebrating alongside the winning teams. 6.

Summarize the following: Create a record of your dairy consumption and symptoms from day to day. Keep track of what dairy foods you eat (milk, yogurt, ice cream, cheese, cottage cheese), the serving size, what time you eat them, and what you eat with them. In another column, keep track of when you have symptoms, what the symptoms are, and how long they last. This can help you and your doctor make a diagnosis, and figure out which foods are most likely to give you symptoms. Use a notebook, journal, online tool like excel or Google Docs, or wall chart – whatever helps you stay organized. If you want to keep your symptoms private, use something hand-held that only you can access. If you think you may be lactose intolerant, try to avoid eating dairy for a couple days or even 1-2 weeks. Make note of whether or not your symptoms subside or go away. Inform your doctor if your symptoms improve when you don’t have dairy. Bloating, cramps, gas, diarrhea, or stomach noise after eating might be caused by lactose intolerance. However, you want to be sure you know what is causing your symptoms, and rule out any other possible reasons for your stomach upset. Make a doctor’s appointment to get tested, and discuss the possible cause of your lactose intolerance. There are a few different kinds of tests that your doctor can do:  For a lactose tolerance test, you drink a liquid containing lots of lactose and have a blood test done two hours later. For the hydrogen breath test you also drink a high-lactose liquid, and then your doctor measures how much hydrogen is in your breath at set intervals. A stool acidity test simply checks a stool sample; it is used for infants or children who can’t do the other tests. It might feel stressful if you have to change your diet, and you might be worried about what others will think. Fortunately, many people eat specific diets and you can explain your condition to others however you want to. Be vague, offer a simple explanation, or – if you want – wow others with your scientific knowledge!  It’s okay to say simply, “Dairy upsets my stomach so I try to stay away from it,” or, “If I have too much milk, I feel sick.” You can also be specific, if you want to educate others. Say something like, “I’m lactose intolerant because I don’t have enough of the enzyme in my body that breaks down the sugar in milk, lactose.” Some people might think that if you drink a sip of milk or can eat yogurt, you’re lying about being lactose intolerant. Many people simply don’t understand the condition. Explain that most people who are lactose intolerant can eat some dairy products and not others, or dairy in small amounts.  You can try to explain to people using an example, such as, “It probably wouldn’t affect you very much if you drink half a cup of coffee, but if you drink four espressos you might feel jittery, right? That’s how I am with dairy – a little is okay, a lot makes me feel sick.” You can also explain that you’re not allergic to milk, so drinking it isn't unsafe. Explain that it’s the sugar in dairy that upsets your stomach, and there’s more milk sugar in some things (like whole milk) than others (like dairy and hard cheeses). Summary:","output":"To determine if you have lactose intolerance, create a daily record of your dairy consumption and any symptoms experienced. Note the dairy foods, serving size, and accompanying meals. Track any symptoms, their duration, and when they occur. Use a notebook, journal, or digital tool for organization, and keep it private if desired. Avoid dairy for a few days or weeks and monitor symptom changes. Inform your doctor and get tested through lactose tolerance, hydrogen breath, or stool acidity tests.

It highlights that the speaker has observed weather shifts, such as the spring dust storms experienced back in the 1970s when they were in college. However, this observation alone is not sufficient to ascertain the connection between the observed changes in weather and global warming. Global warming is a complex phenomenon, driven by the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere, mainly due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. While it is true that global warming can lead to shifts in weather patterns and more extreme weather events, drawing a direct causal link between specific weather patterns and global warming requires a thorough analysis of meteorological data, historical trends, and climate models.

Movie plot title: Even the Rain Movie plot: Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Costa (Luis Tosar), both in their mid thirties, are life long friends only in the way a warring couple might be. Sebastian is an obsessive idealist who has sworn to his inner self that he will direct a film about one of the worlds most iconic figures, Christopher Columbus (Karra Elejalde). Not for him the hypocritical lies of a genius sailor on a divine mission to win souls for Christ. He is determined to upturn the entire conservative myth of Western Civilization's arrival in the Americas as a force for good. Rather, his story is about what Columbus set in motion; the obsession with gold, the hunt for slaves by Spanish mastiffs, and punitive violence to those Indians who fought back. His story is counterbalanced by the radical priests Bartolome de las Casas (Raul Arevalo) and Antonio Montestinos (Carlos Santos) who were the first to raise their voice in defence of the Indians, and ask the question, Are these men? Sebastian is also obsessed by the first Indian leader to resist - Hatuey (Carlos Aduviri), who was nailed to a cross and crucified as example to those who oppose the Christians. The talented and brilliant actor playing Columbus constantly challenges Sebastian and accuses him of agit prop and cheap manipulation. Costa doesn't give a shit. He cares little about what happened yesterday, never mind 500 years ago. The only thing that matters to him is his professional pride as a producer - that the film is made on time and within budget. Costa has come up with an insane idea, but the only way to get a difficult film made within the limitations of their modest budget.

Please answer the following question: Q: In which order does the reactivity of halogen group decline?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one more electron. Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally “eager” to donate.

News article: First ever observed case of ‘river piracy’ saw the Slims river disappear as intense glacier melt suddenly diverted its flow into another watercourse      An immense river that flowed from one of Canada’s largest glaciers vanished over the course of four days last year, scientists have reported, in an unsettling illustration of how global warming dramatically changes the world’s geography.      The abrupt and unexpected disappearance of the Slims river, which spanned up to 150 metres at its widest points, is the first observed case of “river piracy”, in which the flow of one river is suddenly diverted into another.      Collapsing Greenland glacier could raise sea levels by half a metre, say scientists Read more      For hundreds of years, the Slims carried meltwater northwards from the vast Kaskawulsh glacier in Canada’s Yukon territory into the Kluane river, then into the Yukon river towards the Bering Sea. But in spring 2016, a period of intense melting of the glacier meant the drainage gradient was tipped in favour of a second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination.      The continental-scale rearrangement was documented by a team of scientists who had been monitoring the incremental retreat of the glacier for years. But on a 2016 fieldwork expedition they were confronted with a landscape that had been radically transformed.      “We went to the area intending to continue our measurements in the Slims river, but found the riverbed more or less dry,” said James Best, a geologist at the University of Illinois. “The delta top that we’d been sailing over in a small boat was now a dust storm. In terms of landscape change it was incredibly dramatic.”      Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Washington Tacoma and the paper’s lead author, added: “The water was somewhat treacherous to approach, because you’re walking on these old river sediments that were really goopy and would suck you in. And day by day we could see the water level dropping.”      The team flew a helicopter over the glacier and used drones to investigate what was happening in the other valley, which is less accessible.      “We found that all of the water that was coming out from the front of the glacier, rather than it being split between two rivers, it was going into just one,” said Best.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Kaskawulsh River, seen here near its headwaters, is running higher now thanks to the addition of water that used to flow into the Slims River. Photograph: Jim Best/University of Illinois      While the Slims had been reduced to a mere trickle, the reverse had happened to the south-flowing Alsek river, a popular whitewater rafting river that is a Unesco world heritage site. The previous year, the two rivers had been comparable in size, but the Alsek was now 60 to 70 times larger than the Slims, flow measurements revealed.      The data also showed how abrupt the change had been, with the Slims’ flow dropping precipitously from the 26 to 29 May 2016.      Geologists have previously found evidence of river piracy having taken place in the distant past. “But nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,” said Shugar. “People had looked at the geological record, thousands or millions of years ago, not the 21st century, where it’s happening under our noses.”      Prof Lonnie Thompson, a paleoclimatologist at Ohio State University who was not involved in the work, said the observations highlight how incremental temperature increases can produce sudden and drastic environmental impacts. “There are definitely thresholds which, once passed in nature, everything abruptly changes,” he said.      Glacier melt shows a climate change tipping point. We must pay attention | Wendell Tangborn Read more      Between 1956 and 2007, the Kaskawulsh glacier retreated by 600-700m. In 2016, there was a sudden acceleration of the retreat, and the pulse of meltwater led to a new channel being carved through a large ice field. The new channel was able to deliver water to the Alsek’s tributary whose steeper gradient resulted in the Slims headwater being suddenly rerouted along a new southwards trajectory.      In a geological instant, the local landscape was redrawn.      Where the Slims once flowed, Dall sheep from Kluane National Park are now making their way down to eat the fresh vegetation, venturing into territory where they can legally be hunted. The formerly clear air is now often turned into a dusty haze as powerful winds whip up the exposed riverbed sediment. Fish populations are being redistributed and lake chemistry is being altered. Waterfront land, which includes the small communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay, is now further from shore.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sections of the newly exposed bed of Kluane Lake contain small pinnacles. Wind has eroded sediments with a harder layer on top that forms a protective cap as the wind erodes softer and sandier sediment below. These pinnacles, just a few centimeters high, are small-scale versions of what are sometimes termed “hoodoos.” Photograph: Jim Best/University of Illinois      A statistical analysis, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests that the dramatic changes can almost certainly be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The calculations put chance of the piracy having occured due to natural variability at 0.5%. “So it’s 99.5% that it occurred due to warming over the industrial era,” said Best.      The Yukon region is extremely sparsely inhabited, but future river piracy could have catastrophic effects on towns, villages and ecosystems that have sprung up around available water, according to an analysis accompanying the paper, by Rachel Headley, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. “If a river changes course so drastically that the drainage basin no longer reaches its original outlet, this change might eventually impact human and biological communities that have grown around the river’s original outlet,” she said.      Thompson, who has documented glacial retreat on Mount Kilimanjaro, predicts that there will be an acceleration in the observations of river piracy events as glaciers retreat globally.      “I think we could see similar divergence in streams in the Himalayas as well as throughout the Third Pole region, the Andes of Peru, other sites in northern Canada and Alaska,” he said. “Often these events occur in remote and poor parts of our planet and thus go largely unnoticed by the larger population but greatly impact the livelihood of many families downstream.” ||||| Images captured by the European Space Agency's Sentinel2 satellite in 2015 and 2016 show a dramatic drop in the Slims River's flow. The receding toe of Kaskawulsh Glacier is seen at the bottom. Kluane Lake can be seen at the top of the 2016 image. Water now flows east and then south via the Kaskawulsh River. Credit: European Space Agency The massive Kaskawulsh Glacier in northern Canada has retreated about a mile up its valley over the past century.      Last spring, its retreat triggered a geologic event at relatively breakneck speed. The toe of ice that was sending meltwater toward the Slims River and then north to the Bering Sea retreated so far that the water changed course, joining the Kaskawulsh River and flowing south toward the Gulf of Alaska.      This capture of one river's flow by another, documented in a study led by the University of Washington Tacoma and published April 17 in Nature Geoscience, is the first known case of \\"river piracy\\" in modern times. \\"Geologists have seen river piracy, but nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,\\" said lead author Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Washington Tacoma. \\"People had looked at the geological record—thousands or millions of years ago—not the 21st century, where it's happening under our noses.\\"      River piracy, also known as stream capture, can happen due to tectonic motion of Earth's crust, landslides, erosion or, in this case, changes in a glacial dam. The new study documents one of the less-anticipated shifts that can occur in a changing climate.      A Sept. 2, 2016 aerial photo shows the meltwater stream along the toe of Kaskawulsh Glacier, seen on the left, that is diverting fresh water from one river to the other. Credit: Dan Shugar/University of Washington Tacoma      Shugar and co-authors Jim Best at the University of Illinois and John Clague at Canada's Simon Fraser University had planned fieldwork last summer on the Slims River, a geologically active system that feeds Kluane Lake in the Yukon. When they arrived in August, the river was not flowing. River gauges show an abrupt drop over four days from May 26 to 29, 2016.      By late summer, \\"there was barely any flow whatsoever. It was essentially a long, skinny lake,\\" Shugar said. \\"The water was somewhat treacherous to approach, because you're walking on these old river sediments that were really goopy and would suck you in. And day by day we could see the water level dropping.\\"      The research team puzzled about what to do next. They got permission to use their mapping drone to create a detailed elevation model of the glacier tongue and headwater region. The resulting paper is a geological postmortem of the river's disappearance.      \\"For the last 300 years, Slims River flowed out to the Bering Sea, and the smaller Kaskawulsh River flowed to the Gulf of Alaska. What we found was the glacial lake that fed Slims River had actually changed its outlet,\\" Shugar said. \\"A 30-meter (100-foot) canyon had been carved through the terminus of the glacier. Meltwater was flowing through that canyon from one lake into another glacial lake, almost like when you see champagne poured into glasses that are stacked in a pyramid.\\"      A close-up view of the ice-walled canyon at the terminus of the Kaskawulsh Glacier, with recently collapsed ice blocks. This canyon now carries almost all meltwater from the toe of the glacier down the Kaskawulsh Valley and toward the Gulf of Alaska. Credit: Jim Best/University of Illinois      That second lake drains via the Kaskawulsh River in a different direction than the first. The situation is fairly unique, Shugar said, since the glacier's toe was sitting on a geologic divide.      Clague began studying this glacier years ago for the Geological Survey of Canada. He observed that Kluane Lake, which is Yukon's largest lake, had changed its water level by about 40 feet (12 meters) a few centuries ago. He concluded that the Slims River that feeds it had appeared as the glacier advanced, and a decade ago predicted the river would disappear again as the glacier retreated.      \\"The event is a bit idiosyncratic, given the peculiar geographic situation in which it happened, but in a broader sense it highlights the huge changes that glaciers are undergoing around the world due to climate change,\\" Clague said.      The geologic event has redrawn the local landscape. Slims River crosses the Alaska Highway, and its banks were a popular hiking route. Now that the riverbed is exposed, Dall sheep from Kluane National Park are making their way down to eat the fresh vegetation, venturing into territory where they can legally be hunted. With less water flowing in, Kluane Lake did not refill last spring, and by summer 2016 was about 3 feet (1 meter) lower than ever recorded for that time of year. Waterfront land, which includes the small communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay, is now farther from shore. As the lake level continues to drop researchers expect this will become an isolated lake cut off from any outflow.

The river has gained new discharge since its piracy of the Slims River waters in 2016, and now flows into the Kaskawulsh valley with increased flows. Credit: Jim Best      On the other hand, the Alsek River, a popular whitewater rafting river that is a UNESCO world heritage site, was running higher last summer due to the addition of the Slims River's water.      Shifts in sediment transport, lake chemistry, fish populations, wildlife behavior and other factors will continue to occur as the ecosystem adjusts to the new reality, Shugar said.      \\"So far, a lot of the scientific work surrounding glaciers and climate change has been focused on sea-level rise,\\" Shugar said. \\"Our study shows there may be other underappreciated, unanticipated effects of glacial retreat.\\"      The Kaskawulsh Glacier is retreating up the valley because of both readjustment after a cold period centuries ago, known as the Little Ice Age, and warming due to greenhouse gases. A technique published in 2016 by UW co-author Gerard Roe shows a 99.5 percent probability that this glacier's retreat is showing the effects of modern climate change.      \\"I always point out to climate-change skeptics that Earth's glaciers are becoming markedly smaller, and that can only happen in a warming climate,\\" Clague said.

Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments, but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier—one of Canada’s largest glaciers—abruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016. We use a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016, meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A huge river that flowed from one of Canada's largest glaciers disappeared in just four days last year due to the retreat of glacier ice, in the first ever observed case of \\"river piracy\\".

Information:  - Edmond Gareginovich Keosayan (9 October 1936  21 April 1994) was an Armenian Soviet film director and musician.  - Mosfilm (\\"Mosfilm\\" ) is a film studio that is among the largest and oldest in the Russian Federation and in Europe. Its output includes most of the more widely acclaimed Soviet-era films, ranging from works by Andrei Tarkovsky and Sergei Eisenstein (commonly considered the greatest Soviet directors), to Red Westerns, to the Akira Kurosawa co-production \\"Dersu Uzala\\" (') and the epic \\"War and Peace\\" (').  - The Ostern (Eastern) or Red Western (also known as \\"Borscht Western\\") was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries' take on the Western. The term refers to two related genres:  - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films.  - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.  - The Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Neulovimye mstiteli\\") is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Little Red Devils by Pavel Blyakhin, under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers ( Russian :    , translit . Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh ) is a 1968 Soviet action movie , a sequel of The Elusive Avengers , directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm . The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire , or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971 .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Korona Rossiyskoy Imperii, ili Snova Neulovimye\\") is a 1971 Soviet action movie, a second sequel of \\"The Elusive Avengers\\", directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm.

It doesn't heat up and merely spirts out water. This indicates a significant flaw, which can be a deterrent for the purchase. 3. The problem appears to be connected with the weak cord of the product. In the reviewer's opinion, it is not made very sturdy nor attached properly, which led to it coming apart after some use. This shows a clear issue with the product's build quality. 4. Lastly, the reviewer expresses frustration about trying to fix the product and hoping it doesn't end up as waste.

Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away.

Passage: The nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies – organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: You are given a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  and a hint : From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  Please answer this question : Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","output":"Based on Aristotle's theory of tetrapods, the tetrapod that would live longer is tetA. The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: 1. TetA is heavier than tetB in terms of adult body mass. 2. According to Aristotle's theory, an increase in body mass is associated with an increase in lifespan. Hence, a heavier tetrapod, such as tetA, is expected to live longer than a lighter tetrapod, like tetB. 3. TetA also has a longer gestation period compared to tetB. 4. Aristotle's theory states that lifespan increases with gestation period. Therefore, the fact that tetA has a longer gestation period further supports the idea that it would have a longer lifespan compared to tetB. So, considering both the body mass and gestation period factors, it can be concluded that tetA is expected to live longer than tetB based on Aristotle's theory of tetrapods."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"Not responding\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Bristol Swings for the Fence, Misses Bristol-Myers Squibb has succeeded in recent years by swinging for the fences. But it just whiffed on a big pitch, to the delight of its rival Merck. Both companies make similar drugs that help the body's immune system fight tumors. They seem to work far better in patients whose cancers express a large amount of a certain protein the drugs target, called PD-L1. Merck has focused narrowly on testing for and treating such patients with its drug, Keytruda. Bristol, on the other hand, has targeted a much broader set of patients, and its drug can be used without advance testing. That has helped its drug, Opdivo, get a big sales lead -- it outsold Keytruda by more than 500 million in the second quarter. But in one of the biggest possible treatment markets, newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer, Bristol's approach has fallen flat. The company announced Friday morning that Opdivo had failed in its Phase 3 trial for the disease. Merck announced far better results for its approach in June. Bristol's shares were down 17 percent Friday morning, while Merck's were up 6 percent. After Bristol-Myers' risky clinical trial strategy blew up in its face, Merck will beat the firm to market in a huge set of lung cancer patients. Intraday times are displayed in ET. Before Friday, the big unknown about Bristol's trial was exactly how aggressive it was about patient selection. Really aggressive, it turns out! Merck's study was restricted to patients whose tumors had at least 50 percent PD-L1 expression. Bristol's cutoff , in contrast, was just 5 percent. If its approach had worked, then it might have gotten approval for treatment of a much wider population, cementing Opdivo's commercial dominance. Instead it now faces an uncertain future in this treatment area -- its approval for use on its own in newly diagnosed patients could be long-delayed or abandoned altogether. In a way, it made sense for Bristol to chase a wider patient population, an approach that has worked for it so far. But in this case, given the size of the potential market, it could have afforded to be more cautious. There's a whole lot of still-lucrative space between five and fifty percent PD-L1 expression. The cost of its gamble is a 33 billion total swing in market cap between it and Merck. The news is vindication for Merck's caution. In the face of Opdivo's more-rapid sales growth, Merck has steadfastly maintained that focusing on the most promising patient population was the correct strategy. Now Merck's likely approval in newly diagnosed patients should narrow the sales gap with Opdivo. Bristol Myers' Opdivo has thrashed Merck's similar medicine, but a setback in a key clinical trial may begin to change that. The long-term impact for Bristol is harder to nail down. Opdivo has a head start in many other treatment areas, particularly in trials of combinations with other drugs. Bristol is testing Opdivo alongside chemotherapy and another immuno-oncology drug, hoping it will make it effective in an even broader set of patients. Data may come as early as next year, and approval would give Opdivo sales another boost. Then again, AstraZeneca expects to have data from a similar combination trial first. Either way, Merck is likely to have a leg up in a big market. Bristol should take this lesson to heart and try hitting for average once in a while.

In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get.  Which lake will have less dead zones?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that lake Costanza will likely have less dead zones.

Hong Kong Pulls Out of Recession HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's economy broke out of a yearlong recession in the second quarter as the territory benefited from strong growth in mainland China and better conditions in the West, the government said Friday. The southern Chinese territory's economy, slammed four straight quarters by free-falling world demand for exports, grew by 3.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the government said. With the global economy starting to level out, Hong Kong made a less pessimistic forecast for all of 2009, saying gross domestic product was set to shrink between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent rather than 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. \\"As the global economy is still subject to uncertainties, we cannot afford to be complacent,\\" said Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang. Higher demand for Hong Kong's exports, particularly from mainland China, where massive stimulus spending and relaxed monetary policy is driving growth, helped explain the turnaround. Exports dropped 12.4 percent in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, the government said. That was tamer than the nearly 23 percent drop-off in the first quarter. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Hong Kong's economy emerged from a yearlong recession in the second quarter due to strong growth in mainland China and improved conditions in the West.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit","output":"The review \\"aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit\\" can be interpreted as having a negative opinion of the movie. Let's break down the review to better understand the sentiment behind it. The phrase \\"aims for the toilet\\" is an analogy suggesting that the quality, content, or ambitions of the movie are comparable to something low or unpleasant. This can imply that the movie failed to achieve what it set out to do, or that it was of a distasteful nature. When a reviewer considers a film to be in line with something as unrefined as a toilet, it showcases a negative perspective on the work. The second part of the review, \\"scores a direct hit,\\" dials in on the effectiveness of the movie in terms of leaving the intended impression. In this specific context, the fact that the movie achieves its goal of being associated with something unpalatable speaks volumes about the reviewer's low opinion of the film. Scoring a direct hit in this scenario means that the movie effectively managed to fully immerse itself in the unpleasant territory, leaving the reviewer with a poor perception of the work. So, combining the two elements of the review, we see a picture of a movie that the reviewer believes to have aimed for low and distasteful ambitions, and, unfortunately, it succeeded in doing so.

Q: Passage: The Buccaneers played a more consistent game, but still came up short in Buffalo. After scoring early in the third quarter, Buffalo took a 17-6 lead. After another Bills field goal, and two touchdown passes from Jameis Winston to rookie tight-end O. J. Howard, the game was tied, 20-20. With just over 3 minutes remaining in regulation, another touchdown pass by Winston, this time a diving catch just inbounds by Mike Evans gave the Buccaneers a 27-20 lead. On the next drive, the Bills drove down the field in three plays to tie the game, aided by an ill-timed 15-yard Unnecessary Roughness penalty by Robert McClain. With 2:20 left in the fourth, a pass from Winston to Adam Humphries was fumbled and recovered by the Bills at Tampa Bay 32-yard line.

What are some seemingly insignificant incidents that later changed the course of history? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPT: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","output":"[2]. yes; These two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about minor events or incidents that ultimately led to major changes in the course of history. Here are a few examples: 1. The Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1914): The murder of Archduke Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Bosnian Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip might have seemed a minor event at the time. However, it ultimately began a chain of events that led to World War I, the collapse of several European empires, and set the stage for World War II. 2. The Discovery of Penicillin (1928): Alexander Fleming's chance discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic, revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections. The discovery of penicillin led to the development of many other antibiotics, which have since become an essential part of modern healthcare. 3. Rosa Parks' Bus Stand (1955): In 1955, Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to give up her bus seat for a white passenger, leading to her arrest for violating segregation laws. This seemingly small act of defiance sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and fueled the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, leading to significant changes in racial equality and integration. 4. The Invention of the World Wide Web (1989): The creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN may have initially seemed insignificant, but it revolutionized the way information is shared and accessed across the globe. It has since transformed nearly every aspect of modern life, from communication to commerce to social interactions. 5. An Apple Falling From a Tree (Late 17th Century): The story goes that Isaac Newton was inspired to form his theory of gravitation after witnessing an apple falling from a tree. This simple observation led Newton to develop his groundbreaking ideas on gravity, motion, and the laws that govern the universe. These theories laid the foundation for modern physics and our understanding of the cosmos. While these incidents may have seemed small or insignificant at the time, they had profound effects on the course of history, shaping our world in ways that continue to resonate today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process:  - Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste - The waste is eventually removed from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less food is put into the mouth happens, how will it affect less food travels to the small intestine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis proposes that if less food is put into the mouth, it will affect the amount of food that travels to the small intestine. This can indeed have several direct and indirect effects on the digestive process. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced Caloric Intake: Consuming less food can directly result in a lower caloric intake. This can lead to weight loss or insufficient energy levels depending on the individual's daily energy requirements. As the small intestine is responsible for absorbing nutrients, less food would mean fewer nutrients available for absorption. 2. Limited Nutrient Absorption: If less food makes it to the small intestine, it can result in a shortage of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. These nutrients are crucial for maintaining bodily functions, supporting the immune system, growth, and overall health. 3. Changes in Stomach Functionality: Since less food enters the stomach, the stomach produces a lesser amount of acid, hormones, and enzymes. This can result in changes in the overall functionality and efficiency of the stomach, such as slowed gastric emptying, which may in turn impact the total time food spends in the small intestine, as well as the large intestine. Indirect Effects: 1. Altered Appetite and Satiety: As less food is consumed, the individual may experience alterations in appetite and satiety signals. This could make it challenging to maintain a balanced diet, affecting metabolism and energy levels. 2. Impact on Gut Microbiome: The reduced intake of food can indirectly affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Each type of food we consume has a different effect on the microbes in our digestive system. A decreased food intake may lead to a less diverse gut microbiota, which could negatively impact digestion, immunity, and overall health. 3. Emotional and Psychological Consequences: Eating habits are often intertwined with emotions and psychological well-being. A significant change in food consumption can lead to mood imbalances, stress, or even disordered eating patterns. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis states that if less food is put into the mouth, it will have a direct effect on the amount of food traveling into the small intestine. This can directly reduce the caloric content and limit nutrient absorption, while indirectly impacting appetite, satiety signals, gut microbiome composition, and an individual's emotional and psychological well-being."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

To carry out this task, we'll first break down the components of each statement and then examine their relationship. Premise: \\"and his name is B J\\" Hypothesis: \\"people call him B J, and in addition\\" In the premise, we are given a piece of information that someone's name is \\"B J.\\" However, the full context and subject is unclear due to the introductory conjunction \\"and\\" that suggests this statement is connected to another piece of information not provided here. Nevertheless, the main point is that there is a person whose name is \\"B J.\\" In the hypothesis, we are given two distinct pieces of information which we can break down further: 1. \\"people call him B J\\" 2. \\"and in addition\\" The first part of the hypothesis states that \\"people call him B J.\\" This provides us with some information about the social aspect where the person goes by the name \\"B J.\\" Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and this first component of the hypothesis. While the premise establishes that the person's name is \\"B J,\\" the hypothesis makes an assertion about how people refer to this person. In some cases, a person's given name might not be the same as what they are called by others (for instance, they could have a nickname). However, in this case, the name \\"B J\\" is the same in both the premise and the first part of the hypothesis. Therefore, we can infer a connection between the premise and this portion of the hypothesis. The second part of the hypothesis, \\"and in addition,\\" is an expression typically used to introduce further information. However, there is no additional information provided here, which leaves this part of the hypothesis incomplete and ambiguous. Consequently, this section does not have any direct or clear relationship with the premise. In summary, the premise appears to partially entail the hypothesis as it supports the claim that the person is called \\"B J\\" by others, but it does not provide any information or connection to the incomplete second part of the hypothesis (\\"and in addition\\").

What is the answer for the question: Who plays the commander of the tank that kills Taj's brother? from the following article ?  In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks—commanded by ruthless commander Daskal (George Dzundza)—takes a wrong turn through a mountain pass and enters a blind valley. Taj returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed, and his brother martyred by being crushed under Daskal's tank. As the new khan following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin Moustafa, an opportunistic scavenger. Together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue Daskal's tank (which they call \\"The Beast\\"), counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. Lost, isolated, and with their radio damaged in the attack, the tank crew set out to find Kandahar Road and return to Soviet lines. While camping for the night, Afghan communist crewman Samad educates the reluctant tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko, about the Pashtun people's code of honour, Pashtunwali; particularly nanawatai, which requires that an enemy is to be given sanctuary if he asks.

Death caps are highly poisonous mushrooms with 6 inches (15 cm) wide caps. These caps might be yellow, white, brownish, or greenish in color, and are generally sticky to the touch. Death cap mushrooms have white gills, and they grow on 5 inch (13 cm) tall stalks.  The death cap is blamed for the most mushroom poisonings in the world. These mushrooms generally grow from September to November in the US and Europe. Destroying angels are known for a wide cap, medium-sized stalk, and frilly gills. Destroying angel caps can be either pure white, or white at the edge and light yellow, light pink, or pale tan at the center.  Destroying angels typically grow near the roots of trees or shrubs. They are most common in the summer and fall. They are typically about 2–5 inches (5.1–12.7 cm) across. Death caps, destroying angels, and many other harmful mushrooms belong to the Amanita family of mushrooms. Although you may pass over some potentially edible mushroom, you can avoid the whole family by staying away from mushrooms with their particular characteristics. These include:  White gills A skirt or ring on the stem A bulbous or sack-like base called a volva As a good rule of thumb, never consume a mushroom until you have positively identified that species at least 3 times.

Article: The 4-year-old boy was mentally disabled, unable to speak in complete sentences and unable to play with other children because of his violent fits  of hitting and biting. The decision facing one Brooklyn jury was how much a landlord should pay in damages to the boy -- named \\"G.M.M.\\" in court documents -- after an investigation showed he had been living in an apartment illegally coated with lead paint. Attorneys  representing G.M.M. said 3.4 million was the right number, arguing that the boy would have had a bright career ahead of him; both of his parents had graduated from college and his mother received a master's degree. But the landlord's defense put the figure at less than half that -- 1.5 million. Attorney Roger Archibald noted that because the boy was Hispanic, G.M.M. was unlikely to attain the advanced education that would provide to such a large income. The 4-year-old's case is a rare public look at one corner of the American legal system that explicitly uses race and gender to determine how much victims or their families should receive in compensation  when they are seriously injured or killed. As a result, white and male victims often receive larger awards than people of color and women in similar cases. These differences largely derive from _ of how much more money individuals would have earned over their lifetimes had they not been injured -- projections that take into account average earnings and employment levels by race and gender.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 10:31 EST, 13 October 2011. A cargo ship which spilled hundreds of tons of oil remained perched on a New Zealand reef today, as locals descended on a nearby beach to scavenge from the vessel's washed-up load. Salvage crews are still debating whether the remaining fuel on the Liberian-flagged Rena can be pumped from the ship before it breaks up. And as rescue crews tried to stabilise the ship, local residents in Tauranga, New Zealand, have been spotted inspecting the containers of cargo and surveying the disaster from the shore. Assessing the damage: Two residents walk along the beach inspecting the washed-up cargo from the Rena vessel in Taurange, New Zealand today. Surveying the scene: More locals flock to the shore where containers from the Rena washed up. Further inspection of the washed-up cargo showed the beach littered with thousands of part-cooked meat patties from one of the Rena's containers. But anyone hoping for a valuable haul from the stricken vessel would have turned up disappointed - as the Rena mainly shed thousands of partly-cooked burgers on to the sand. The ship itself is being slowly battered to pieces by pounding waves, with rescuers needing to stabilise the Rena before any oil transfer can start. Environmentalists have warned of a disaster for wildlife if all the ship's 1,870 tons (1,700 metric tons) of oil and 220 tons (200 metric tons) of diesel is allowed to spill into the ocean. Crews attempting to start the salvage effort have also been hampered by the severe structural damage sustained on the vessel. Other items from the containers washed up in Tauranga, New Zealand included these deer skins. As another container washed up on the beach at Mt Maunganui, New Zealand, rescuers were trying to get near the vessel to transfer away its oil. Meanwhile, several of the 88 containers that have fallen off its deck had washed ashore by Thursday, and authorities confirmed one container that toppled overboard contained a hazardous substance. However, an official said it should not pose a major threat. Heavy seas had kept salvage crews away from the 775-foot (236-meter) vessel for days, but a break in the weather allowed three team members to be winched aboard the Liberian-flagged Rena, which ran aground Oct 5 on Astrolabe Reef, 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Tauranga Harbour on New Zealand's North Island. Clean up: Soldiers work to clear away the oil spill from the beach in Taurange, New Zealand, as environmentalists warned of a potential wildlife disaster. In trouble: Rescuers have been unable to properly reach the ship due to the severe structural damage it has suffered. Mystery: Investigators have so been unable to explain how the vessel managed to perch itself on the New Zealand reef, as the ship remains in danger of spilling more oil and containers. Ewart Barnsley, spokesman for Maritime New Zealand which is managing the emergency response, said the salvage crew found oil hoses and pumps for transferring fuel largely undamaged aboard the ship. They also concluded that the ship was safe to work from. Barnsley said a barge was moored nearby to receive oil, but a decision on when that transfer might start would not be made before Friday. Marine New Zealand salvage manager Bruce Anderson said the vessel needed to stop moving before the oil could be pumped out and it apparently had. 'While this is good news, we shouldn't get too excited,' Anderson told reporters. 'We already had a complex project to start with; it's even harder now that we've sustained damage aboard this vessel,' he said, referring to recent structural cracking. A vertical crack in the ship runs around the entire vessel - meaning the ship is now only held together by its internal components, said Steve Jones, another spokesman for Maritime New Zealand. 'The reality is the vessel could break up at any point,' Jones told The Associated Press. Six vessels have been mobilized to intercept the drifting containers and other debris in the water. There were 1,368 containers on board, 11 of which contained hazardous substances, Maritime New Zealand said. One of the hazardous containers is among those that have fallen overboard, Jones said. Agency spokesman Nick Bohm said the. container held alkyl sulfonic acid, which can be harmful in its original. state, but becomes less toxic when diluted with water. The whereabouts. of that container are unknown. Some. of the contents of containers that had washed ashore were strewn across. the coastline on Thursday, including thousands of meat patties that. littered the sand. The. ship's 44-year-old Filipino captain was charged Wednesday with operating. a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk and was. released on bail Wednesday at Tauranga District Court. Potential disaster: An aerial view of the stranded cargo vessel Rena shows the boat listing to one side and patches of oil leaking from its storage tanks. Clean-up: A shag covered in oil is helped by wildlife veterinarian Dr Brett Gartrell and Aimee Forster at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Tauranga, New Zealand. Concern: The size of the oil spill from the Rena can clearly been seen in this image. The ship's second officer appeared in the same court Thursday on the same charge. Judge Robert Wolff made orders suppressing publication of the defendants' names for the sake of their personal safety. If convicted, each could face a fine of up to 10,000 New Zealand dollars (7,800) and 12 months in prison. Their next court appearance is Oct. 19, when authorities say more charges are likely. The government has demanded to know why the ship crashed into the well-charted reef in calm weather, but the vessel's owner, Greece-based Costamare Inc., has given no explanation. On Thursday, Costamare released a statement apologizing for the incident and said it was investigating how the ship could have run aground. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about a cargo ship called Rena which spilled a lot of oil into the ocean near New Zealand. The ship got stuck on a reef and some of its containers fell into the water and washed up on the beach. People who lived nearby went to the beach to see what was inside the containers. Most of them found part-cooked meat patties (like burgers) and deer skins. Experts are worried that the oil spill could harm animals and the environment. They are trying to remove the remaining oil from the ship and clean up the mess it left behind.

These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day.  But I can use this background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.  What is an answer for this question: Are air currents in Parth traveling uphill or downhill? Answer:","output":"Air currents in Parth are traveling downhill. Since it is nighttime in Parth when it's daytime in Milton, the land in Parth would be cooling down during the night, causing air currents to travel downhill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I went over to a guy's house to see a movie that he had acted in. It was our first date. He starts the movie and I settle back to watch. I was in film school and the guy, Nick, had told me he wanted my “professional” opinion. We're five minutes into the movie when Nick reaches for the remote and says, “Let's fast forward to my part.” I reply that, in order to adequately critique the movie, I should see it from the beginning. Nick assures me that his scene is self-contained and needs no context. A fight scene plays. Nick pauses and asks, “What did you think?” I look confused and Nick says, “Did you miss me? Let's play it again.” I watch the scene again, but still can't make out Nick. Nick rewinds, plays and pauses. “There I am,” he says, gazing fondly at the screen. Except the screen was gray. No actors. No landscape. Nothing, but gray snow. “What do you think,” he asked, his eyes never leaving the empty screen. At that point, I realized Nick was crazy. “That's great!,” I said. “But look at the time. Time sure flies when you're having fun.” Nick was still staring at the screen with a strange little smile. I stood up. Nick stood up, now not smiling. “You're not going anywhere,” Nick said. It's funny how fear works. I've found that in times of danger, adrenaline supersedes fear. I managed to trick Nick, hide from Nick and finally to escape after more than an hour of suspense. Turns out it wasn't even Nick's place. He had taken me to the house of someone he had ripped off in a drug deal. I am very wary now of going to a guy's home unless I know him extremely well. Question: Where did Nick take her to see his movie Answer:","output":"Nick took her to a house, which she later discovered was not his place but instead belonged to someone he had ripped off in a drug deal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If Thirty-eight states adopted the law, and four others have adopted it with provisional restrictions that apply only to narcotics, or to injuries sustained while committing a felony., can we conclude that \\"42 states now use this law, although 4 of these adopted it with provisional restrictions.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, it is accurate to conclude that \\"42 states now use this law, although 4 of these adopted it with provisional restrictions.\\" To elaborate, thirty-eight states have fully adopted the law without any restrictions, which signifies that the provisions of the law apply across the board in those states without any limitations. Since four other states have adopted the law with provisional restrictions concerning narcotics or injuries sustained while committing a felony, these states also use the law but with certain predefined conditions. Combining the number of states with and without restrictions, we have a total count of 38 + 4 = 42 states. Consequently, in the context of the law under discussion, 38 states have embraced it without limitations, whereas the remaining 4 states have implemented it with specific restrictions in place. In conclusion, it is justified to assert that \\"42 states now use this law, although 4 of these adopted it with provisional restrictions.\\" This statement successfully conveys the pertinent data of the law's adoption, including the total count of states using the law and the fact that some states have integrated it with specific limitations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Turkish: Turkey and Iran are the two countries that have been competing for regional influence for centuries ...","output":"Türkiye ve İran, yüzyıllardır bölgesel etki için rekabet eden iki ülkedir ... The longstanding rivalry often played out in neighboring countries plagued by civil wars or political instability, and it is one of the major driving forces shaping the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. The tensions began in the 16th century during the reign of the Safavids in Iran and the Ottomans in Turkey, with the two empires often clashing over territorial claims. Both countries were trying to impose their own interpretations of Islam on the region, differentiating between Sunni and Shia beliefs. During the 20th century, the tensions have often been amplified by the political and ideological differences between the secular republic established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in Turkey, and the Islamic Republic forged after the Iranian revolution in 1979. In the recent years, Turkey and Iran have been vying for influence in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen, often backing opposing sides in these conflicts. They also differ in their stance on several regional issues such as the political crisis in Qatar, the conflict in Yemen, or the war in Syria. Despite the fierce rivalries, Turkey and Iran have also cooperated on several occasions when their interests happened to align, such as in the case of the Kurdish separatism in both countries. They have also collaborated in the past on economic issues, such as the promotion of trade and investment, or the construction of pipelines for oil and gas. In conclusion, while Turkey and Iran remain regional rivals with diverging interests, it is also important to note that their relationship is dynamic and not entirely antagonistic. Both countries understand the necessity of balancing competition with cooperation in a tumultuous region, and they are also aware that their historical, cultural, and religious ties can serve as a bridge for dialogue and understanding.  In Turkish: Türkiye ve İran, yüzyıllardır bölgesel nüfuz için çekişen iki ülkedir. Uzun süreli rekabet genellikle iç savaşlar veya politik istikrarsızlıkla zorlu komşu ülkelerde tezahür etmiştir ve Orta Doğu'daki jeopolitik manzarayı şekillendiren önemli güçlerden biridir. Gerilimler, 16. yüzyılda İran'daki Safevi ve Türkiye'deki Osmanlı hakimiyeti döneminde başladı ve iki imparatorluk genellikle toprak talepleri üzerinde anlaşmazlığa düştü. Her iki ülke de bölgeye kendi İslam yorumlarını dayatmak için çabalıyordu, Sünni ve Şii inançları arasında ayrım yapıyordu. 20. yüzyılda gerilimler genellikle Türkiye'de Mustafa Kemal Atatürk tarafından kurulan laik cumhuriyet ile İran devriminden sonra oluşan İslam Cumhuriyeti arasındaki politik ve ideolojik farklılıklar nedeniyle artırdı. Son yıllarda Türkiye ve İran, Irak, Suriye, Afganistan ve Yemen gibi ülkelerde etki için çekişmişlerdir, genellikle bu çatışmalarda karşı tarafları desteklemişlerdir. Ayrıca Katar'daki politik kriz, Yemen'deki çatışma veya Suriye'deki savaş gibi bir dört dörtlük bölgesel meselelerde tutumları da farklıdır. Şiddetli rekabete rağmen, Türkiye ve İran'ın çıkarları aynı şekilde hizmet ettiğinde birçok durumda işbirliği yapmışlardır, örneğin her iki ülkedeki Kürt ayrılıkçılığı durumunda olduğu gibi. Ayrıca geçmişte ekonomi konularında da işbirliği yapmışlardır, örneğin ticaret ve yatırımın teşvik edilmesi veya petrol ve gaz boru hattı inşası gibi. Sonuç olarak, Türkiye ve İran'ın çıkarları ayrı ayrı olmasına rağmen bölgesel rakipler olarak kalmaları, ilişkilerinin dinamik olduğunu ve tamamen düşmanca olmadığını belirtmek de önemlidir.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Nelson Piquet Souto Maior (Portuguese pronunciation: ['newso pi'ke], born August 17, 1952), known as Nelson Piquet, is a Brazilian former racing driver and businessman. Since his retirement, Piquet has been ranked among the greatest Formula One drivers in various motorsport polls. Piquet had a brief career in tennis before losing interest in the sport and subsequently took up karting and hid his identity to prevent his father discovering his hobby. He became the Brazilian national karting champion in 1971-72 and won the Formula Vee championship in 1976. Context: Nelson Piquet and the number 1 went to a stagnating Lotus team in 1988, and his career took a nose dive despite the Camel sponsored Lotus 100T having the same specification Honda V6 turbo that powered the McLarens of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Nelson, who had 20 wins and 3 World Championships following the 1987 season, began to lose his reputation when he had no wins in 1988, losing his number one status to fellow Brazilian Senna, who won 8 races and the championship for McLaren (Prost won 7 races, while Piquet could only manage three 3rd-place finishes for the season).  In early 1988 he resorted to using the media to attack his rivals and gained a reputation as an outspoken \\"loose cannon\\", such as attacking Mansell and his wife, calling Mansell \\"an uneducated blockhead\\" (and insulting his wife's looks), and calling fellow Senna \\"the Sao Paulo taxi driver\\" and stating that he \\"doesn't like women\\". Piquet retracted his comments when both threatened legal action. He also earned the ire of the Tifosi at the San Marino Grand Prix when he said in an interview with Playboy that Scuderia Ferrari might do better as a team if the boss (Enzo Ferrari) was a younger man instead of the 90-year-old one who rarely attended races due to his age and failing health. Piquet claims he was badly misquoted in the interview, which also had him questioning Alain Prost's standing as the best driver in the world. On the official FIA video review of the 1988 season, Piquet left no doubts that the article got it wrong in his comments about Ferrari (saying that at 90, Enzo Ferrari had to be a strong man to run a Formula One team), and that he considered Prost to be the world's best driver.  Piquet had a dismal 1989 season, driving a Judd V8-powered Lotus which had 125 less hp than the Honda V10s used by McLaren. He (and teammate Satoru Nakajima) once again had no wins and they both even failed to qualify for the 1989 Belgian Grand Prix, Piquet's first non-qualification since the 1982 Detroit Grand Prix. On what was his last attempt to qualify at Spa, Piquet lost his chance when he was slowed by rookie Frenchman Olivier Grouillard, who had gained a reputation throughout the season as a blocker. Question: what was the highlight of his stint with lotus? Answer:","output":"The highlight of Nelson Piquet's stint with Lotus was securing three 3rd-place finishes during the 1988 season, despite driving the less competitive Camel sponsored Lotus 100T car. These podium finishes were notable achievements given the challenges Piquet faced with the car, as well as the intense competition from his fellow drivers, like Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The decision comes as Devyani Khobragade, whose December arrest and strip search in New York strained ties between New Delhi and Washington, headed back to India. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said she hopes this will help gain closure in the incident. U.S. prosecutors accuse Khobragade of lying in a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper.

Make this lower case","output":"Icebergs, when discussed in terms of their shapes and sizes, can be described as highly diverse masses of ice that vary greatly in dimensions and appearances. They are created when chunks of ice break off from glaciers, ice shelves, or sometimes even an ice cap, and commence their journey floating in open waters. Icebergs come in four primary classifications based on their sizes: small, medium, large, and very large. Small icebergs, also known as \\"growlers\\" or \\"bergy bits,\\" typically have a size range of less than 5 meters (16 feet) in length or height. Medium-sized icebergs measure between 5-15 meters (16-49 feet) and are often deemed most suitable for scientific research or exploration purposes, while large icebergs reach up to 45 meters (148 feet) in height. Finally, very large icebergs far exceed the other categories, with some spanning over 75 meters (246 feet) in height. The shapes of icebergs can be just as diverse as their sizes. They are often influenced by several factors, including the composition and structure of the initial ice mass, the rate of melting, the environmental conditions of the area, and even their own individual history of breaking off, melting, and drifting. Some common shapes include: 1. Tabular icebergs: These are characterized by a flat, tabletop-like surface and steep, nearly vertical sides. They generally break off from ice shelves, often in the Antarctic region. 2. Non-tabular icebergs: These come in several more complex forms, such as: - Pinnacle icebergs: Tall and pointed, often with one or more spires or \\"pinnacles\\" protruding from the water. - Wedge-shaped icebergs: These icebergs are angular, appearing as if two flat sides converge to form a single point or edge. - Dome-shaped icebergs: These have a smooth, dome-like appearance and tend to become more rounded as they continue to melt. - Dry-dock icebergs: Colloquially known as \\"swimming pool\\" icebergs, they are characterized by a natural hollow or opening in their center which fills with meltwater. The variety of iceberg shapes and sizes is an area of particular interest to researchers, as each has its own eco-system and impact on global climate conditions. While these magnificent structures can be quite visually stunning and fascinating, they pose a real concern for sea vessels navigating the area. Despite advancements in modern technology, colossal icebergs still present significant hazards to shipping routes, demanding constant vigilance in the world's colder maritime regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.  Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security.  \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\"  Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. After the trade discussion Trump is most likely doing what? - Still looking for a double edged sword - Still reading the 232 report - not enough information - Still considering imposing tariffs Answer:","output":"After the trade discussion, Trump is most likely still considering imposing tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

It is also the color of most growing plants. Sometimes, the word \\"green\\" means young, fresh and growing. For example, a greenhorn is someone who has no experience. In the 15th century, a greenhorn was a young cow or an ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had no experience in war. By the 18th century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job. Someone who is good at growing plants is said to have a green thumb . The expression comes from the early 20th century. A person with a green thumb can make plants grow quickly and well. Green is also the color used to describe the powerful feeling , jealousy . The green-eyed monster  is not a dangerous animal from outer space. It is an expression used about 400 years ago by the British writer William Shakespeare in his play \\"Othello\\". It describes the unpleasant feeling when someone has something he wants. For example, a young man may suffer from the green-eyed monster if you get a pay rise and he does not.

Article:A fifth of nursery providers delivering the current 15 hours' entitlement say they won't be offering the new 30 hours when the scheme starts in September. Official data shows 44,250 providers plan to offer the full entitlement, against 54,900 offering 15 hours now. The government is spending a record £6bn on childcare by 2020. The Department for Education said its survey was conducted between March and July 2016, before the full funding details for 30-hour provision were finalised. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, has long said many of those providing care for three and four-year-olds would be unwilling to deliver the 30-hour offer without extra funding. \\"What's most alarming is that these figures were gathered at a time when many providers thought they would be receiving close to the average funding rate of £4.88 per hour,\\" he said. \\"With final rates currently being confirmed across the country, and many providers discovering that they'll be receiving significantly less, we would expect the number of settings opting out of the 30-hour offer to be even higher than these statistics suggest.\\" Local authorities are currently telling their local providers how much they will be paying. Mr Leitch added that the fact that rates were being frozen until 2020 could make things worse because costs such as wages, rents and mortgages were likely to increase significantly. The DfE data shows that there are currently 22,700 pre-schools and nurseries offering 15 hours of free entitlement. But only 14,600 pre-schools and nurseries say they definitely plan to offer the 30 hours. Meanwhile 8,200 primary schools with nurseries currently offer the 15 hours, but only 3,900 say they intend to offer 30 hours. In addition, 350 maintained nursery schools plan to offer the 30 hours, compared with 400 that currently offer the 15 hours. The only provider type likely to see an increase is childminders, with 25,400 planning to offer the 30 hours, compared with 23,600 who currently offer the 15 hours. The figures come not long after research suggested the DfE had significantly underestimated the number of children likely to be eligible for the extra hours offer. But they also suggest that 60% of larger, group-based providers intend to offer the 30 hours. The DfE said in a statement: \\"Since this survey was conducted, we have published our Early Years National Funding Formula, which will see increased hourly funding rates for the vast majority of providers and our Early Implementers are now successfully delivering the offer a year early.\\" A minimum funding level of £4.30 per hour has since been set centrally.

Summarize this article: Photo: AP      Donald Trump has announced that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will serve as chairman of his transition team, identifying personnel who would become part of a Trump White House. Christie will be working closely with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father he sent to prison.      Just months ago, Trump accused Christie of having committed a federal crime in covering up the Bridgegate scandal. Now, NBC News reports, Christie will bring “substance” and “seriousness” to the Trump campaign:      Sources familiar with the planning say the transition team appointment shows “the role the governor is playing as the serious person around Trump who is trying to provide some discipline” to his growing organization.      Christie also continues to act as “a conduit between the establishment and Trump” based on Christie’s relationships with Republican elected officials across the country, sources said.      The New York Times reported last week that Kushner—Trump’s son-in-law and a real estate heir in his own right—would be a part of the very forward-looking transition team. (President Obama didn’t announce his Transition Team Chariman until the day after he won the 2008 election.) In 2005, as U.S. Attorney for the state of New Jersey, Christie successfully prosecuted Kushner’s father, Charles, for “crimes of greed, power, and excess.”      There does not seem to be any bad blood between Christie and Jared Kushner, however: In November, New Jersey awarded 93 million in tax breaks to a Kushner Companies high-rise in Jersey City.      Asked why the Trump campaign was directing press inquiries about the transition committee to the governor’s office, a spokeswoman for Christie told Gawker, “We’re trying to figure that out ourselves.” ||||| If Christie is truly heading Trump’s day-to-day transition effort, the answer to both questions has to be no, said Max Stier, who is chairman of the Partnership for Public Service and has been advising the campaigns on transition planning. “If Christie is going to really run the transition process, he can’t effectively be active in the campaign or be himself a candidate because it’s a full-time job,” Stier said. In 2012, Mitt Romney tapped former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt to run his transition, and Leavitt kept his distance from the campaign while building out what he called a 600-person “government in miniature.” It’s not clear if Trump plans a similar operation. If Christie’s role atop the transition team was more ceremonial, it might be possible for him to split time with the campaign, to stay in contention to be Trump’s running mate—or even to do the job he was elected to perform, governing the state of New Jersey.      The announcement came just a few days after The New York Times reported that Trump had asked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to head up the transition efforts. Kushner was not mentioned in the press release announcing Christie’s new job. If Monday was an early indication, Christie seems to be operating pretty independently from the campaign: A Trump spokeswoman directed questions about his role to Christie’s gubernatorial office, which promptly referred those queries back to Trump’s campaign.      Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has not publicly announced a transition chief. And the fact that Trump made his own announcement so quickly is at least a momentary relief to those who wondered how seriously he would take the process. “First and foremost, it is really important that Trump has publicly named a transition chairman,” Stier said. “Trump is demonstrating his understanding that he needs to prepare for the possibility that he will be governing at the same time as he is trying to win the campaign.”      We want to hear what you think about this article.

Answer the following question: -  Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the delivery of blood to the kidneys through the renal arteries. This is a crucial step in the overall functioning of the urinary system, as it ensures that the blood is continuously circulated through the kidneys for filtration and the removal of waste products. The circulatory system plays a significant role in this step. The heart pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells and organs. At the same time, it is crucial for the blood to be cleansed of waste materials that are generated by cellular metabolism. This is where the urinary system, including the kidneys, comes into play. The renal arteries branch out from the abdominal aorta, which is the main artery that supplies blood to the abdominal and pelvic organs. These arteries transport oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the kidneys, where the process of filtration begins. When the blood arrives at the kidneys, it contains various waste products such as urea, toxins, excess electrolytes, and other substances that need to be removed in order to maintain the body's overall homeostasis. Inside the kidneys, the blood is filtered through microscopic structures known as nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, and each nephron is equipped with a filtration unit called the glomerulus, followed by a system of tubules responsible for further processing of the filtered blood. The glomerulus is a tiny network of capillaries surrounded by a cup-like structure called the Bowman's capsule. As the blood passes through the glomerulus, water, waste products, and other small molecules are filtered from the blood by a process called glomerular filtration. These filtered substances then move into the surrounding tubules, where further processing occurs, such as reabsorption of important nutrients, secretion of excess substances, and concentration of the fluid. The waste products and water ultimately form urine, which is collected in the renal pelvis before being transported through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until it's time for elimination through the urethra. Meanwhile, the cleaned blood, devoid of waste materials and with the required balance of electrolytes, is returned to the circulatory system via the renal veins, which connect to the inferior vena cava and ultimately bring the blood back to the heart. In summary, the first step in the process of blood filtration and waste removal by the urinary system is the transportation of blood to the kidneys through the renal arteries. This essential step sets the stage for the vital functions performed by the kidneys in maintaining the body's overall balance and promoting good health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: who was mantis in guardians of the galaxy 2?","output":"Mantis is a fictional character from the Marvel Comics Universe and is prominently featured in the 2017 film \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\", which is a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Mantis, portrayed by French actress Pom Klementieff, is an empathic, insect-like alien who becomes an associate of the Guardians of the Galaxy team. Mantis is introduced in the movie as an assistant to Ego, a Celestial (a cosmic, god-like being) portrayed by Kurt Russell. Ego, who is also the biological father of Star-Lord (Peter Quill), played by Chris Pratt, takes the Guardians of the Galaxy team comprising Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Baby Groot to his planet, where they meet Mantis. In the film, Mantis possesses unique abilities, like telepathy and empathic powers. With a gentle touch, she can sense and influence the emotions of others. She uses her empathic powers to help Ego deal with his loneliness by putting him to sleep through her touch, which allows him to rest. However, she is not entirely aware of Ego's sinister intentions, which involve absorbing all planets in the galaxy to extend his power. Over time, Mantis forms a close bond with Drax and the other Guardians, who ultimately discover Ego's evil plans. Once Mantis understands the threat that Ego poses to the universe, she chooses to side with the Guardians of the Galaxy and assists them in their quest to save the galaxy. Mantis plays a crucial role in the climax of the movie, using her empathic powers to mitigate Ego's destructive capabilities and provide the Guardians with a chance to defeat him. As a character, Mantis is portrayed as socially awkward, innocent, and naive, which is endearing to the audience. Her unusual appearance and mannerisms, along with her unique abilities, add depth and diversity to the Guardians of the Galaxy team. Given her earlier alliance with Ego, Mantis's character arc also revolves around finding her true identity and family within the Guardians, learning the values of friendship and heroism. Following her impactful role in \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\", Mantis appears in subsequent MCU films, such as \\"Avengers: Infinity War\\" (2018) and \\"Avengers: Endgame\\" (2019), where she continues to contribute her unique empathic abilities to the team's endeavors.

Premise: \\"and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older i'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The old-style New England saltbox has been better for my knees and back.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"The old-style New England saltbox has been better for my knees and back\\" is entirely true. However, we can analyze the available information and make some observations to give a more in-depth response. The quote provided discusses an old New England saltbox house and the speaker's decision not to paint it due to concerns about climbing ladders as they age. It suggests the desire for less physical strain when maintaining the house, which indicates that the individual may be concerned about their physical well-being, specifically their knees and back. Old New England saltbox houses are typically made from wood and have a simple design with a long, sloping roof in the back, which may require less frequent maintenance. The architectural design allows for easy shedding of snow and rain, potentially reducing potential structural damage. The decision not to paint the house would result in even less maintenance overall, which might be easier on the speaker's knees and back. That being said, it is important to consider other factors of living in an old-style New England saltbox, such as the house's interior layout and potential challenges in day-to-day tasks. For example, older homes may often have narrow staircases and uneven floors, which could impact a person's knees and back over time. Additionally, we should consider the person's overall lifestyle and physical activity. While the specific choice to avoid painting the house and climbing ladders may have some benefits for their knees and back, it is not solely the house style responsible for this outcome. Factors like exercise, posture, and overall wellness also significantly impact a person's knee and back health. In conclusion, while we cannot definitively state that the given hypothesis is true, certain aspects of living in an old-style New England saltbox house, such as reduced maintenance tasks, might lessen the strain on the speaker's knees and back. However, it is essential to consider other factors in the individual's life and the house's specific features that could also impact their overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Matthew Moneypenny (his real name) is Hollywood handsome, with a dressed-down wardrobe of Saint Laurent and an easy patter somewhere between pitchman and showman. He laughs loudly and has a favorite table at Sant Ambroeus in the West Village, as well as a preferred room at the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif. He looks like what industry types call “talent,” but Mr. Moneypenny, 46, isn’t talent (though talented). In the congested little world of fashion image-making, he is talent’s agent, the bargaining power behind the throne. Mr. Moneypenny’s job is to secure high-revenue deals for top-tier images and image-makers. In effect, he said with a practiced twinkle over cookies at a Sant Ambroeus corner table, “to make the world a prettier place.” Mr. Moneypenny is the president and chief executive of Trunk Archive, a photography licensing agency, whose back catalog of images run in magazines and product packaging, are loaded as smartphone backdrops and hang on hotel walls. In Trunk’s trunk are images by hundreds of photographers, including many of fashion’s marquee names: Annie Leibovitz, Bruce Weber, Arthur Elgort and Patrick Demarchelier. Mr. Moneypenny has built Trunk into a digital, long-tail boutique of stylish imagery, making the photographers (and the company) significant amounts of money in the process. They are high-end images for high-end prices. “If Corbis and Getty are Kmart and Walmart,” Mr. Moneypenny said, ticking off two of the larger stock-photo agencies, “we’re Bergdorf Goodman.” Having made a success of reselling existing images, Mr. Moneypenny is now getting into the business of creating new ones. Fueled by investment capital from Waddell & Reed, which has taken positions in companies like Richemont and LVMH, Mr. Moneypenny has spent the last two years quietly buying creative agencies. The result is Great Bowery, a group that will include Trunk Archive and 11 other assignment and licensing agencies under its umbrella. Great Bowery is a mega-agency, one whose ambition is to rebalance the scales, empowering those who make fashion’s imagery — photographers, fashion stylists, hair and makeup artists and set designers — and checking, implicitly, the powerful and increasingly integrated luxury companies and media conglomerates that have traditionally commissioned their work. He sees it as nothing less than the fashion analogue of the rise of the agency system in Hollywood, which unseated the film studios as the sole kingmakers and deal-brokers. “If one can say three pillars were originally music, television and film, I would argue that fashion is now the fourth pillar,” Mr. Moneypenny said. “Twenty years ago, it was the socialite on the Upper East Side or the resident of Mayfair or Beverly Hills that was aware of what was coming down the Chanel or Dior runway. There’s so much more interest about the creativity that comes out of this world.” Mr. Moneypenny is far from the only observer to make this connection, but he is better positioned than most to connect the dots. He is, by his own estimation, the only fashion agent with a background in Hollywood representation and management. He began his career at ICM, the Hollywood agency, talking his way from the mailroom to the desk of Nancy Josephson, the co-president. “He would call up Gucci at the time Tom Ford was designing and say, ‘My boss has no time to shop, send over the entire line,’” said Ms. Josephson, now a partner at WME. “I have a lot of chutzpah, but I would not have thought to do that. And he got me a discount!” The Hollywood model was an explicit reference for Great Bowery. “So many of the systems I learned during my time at ICM, I still employ today,” Mr. Moneypenny said. Fabien Baron, the editorial director of Interview Magazine, has seen what the corporatization of the industry has wrought: the move to be more things to more people, with static budgets and increased demands. Mr. Baron, who is considering a handful of projects with Mr. Moneypenny, expressed admiration for his strategy. “The idea of turning this into the CAA of fashion is interesting,” he said, referring to the Hollywood agency. “It makes a lot of sense to me.” Most of the agencies now under the aegis of Great Bowery, like CLM, M.A.P, Management & Artists and Streeters, are unfamiliar to the public. So, too, are many of the artists they represent. A brief sample of the agency’s top-level talent. Their work is not. You have seen it in the glossy spreads of fashion magazines, the ad campaigns that precede them, the billboards and bus shelters luxury companies commandeer and the videos that run on their Instagram accounts and websites. If they are not, on the whole, household names the way CAA clients like Julia Roberts, George Clooney and Madonna are, Mr. Moneypenny is betting that they can be. Their rates can already run Hollywood stratospheric (“It’s not unusual for a highly talented artist in our world to generate a seven-figure annual income,” he said), and their visibility is rising to match. Is Pat McGrath, the most in-demand of the runway makeup artists, say, primed to become a name-brand megastar? “Some designers are big famous stars,” Mr. Baron said. “Also photographers are, and stylists are, and models are. Everybody’s kind of important. It’s become popular culture.” With importance comes opportunity. Mr. Moneypenny envisages product lines, brand extensions, exhibitions and endorsements even if the jobs these artists now do didn’t exist a generation or two earlier. “Makeup artists and hairdressers who specialized in photo shoots were completely nonexistent,” Grace Coddington, the creative director of Vogue, wrote of her early modeling days in a 2012 memoir. “There was no such thing as a stylist, either, so the better your accessories, which you carried in your bag, too, the more jobs you were likely to get.” As the professions developed and careers were made, agencies evolved to represent artists’ interests and handle their logistics, for a percentage. But the systems put in place, many involved agreed, had stagnated and failed to keep pace with the industry’s changes. “As the companies we do business with became huge, it became more and more difficult to maintain what we believe to be fair terms and conditions for our talent,” Mr. Moneypenny said. Fashion businesses developed into luxury groups and billion-dollar brands; magazines rolled together into media corporations like Condé Nast and Hearst. Arrangements had once been made over handshakes; today contracts can run to 20 pages or more, with byzantine rights agreements and complicated loopholes about usage. Even as the revenues top artists could earn grew, those of many others flat-lined. At the same time, the expectations placed upon them grew. Artists are asked to shoot video in addition to photos, come with social media followings, stage exhibitions and publish books; agencies are expected to support them with departments on digital and technological fronts: “all these new areas,” said Camilla Lowther, a pioneering agent in London and the founder of CLM, which joined Great Bowery in 2014, “which none of us have any experience in. I’m an agent. And probably quite an old-fashioned agent, to be totally honest with you. I’ve been doing this for 35 years.” Many of the changes Great Bowery hopes to affect are of the unsexy, business-efficiency type. By combining agencies into one organization — and, as of late March, one lavishly grafittied building, the 1898 former Germania Bank building on the Bowery — it hopes to consolidate back-end services like legal, accounting, human resources and operations and share them across the entire company. Mr. Moneypenny said that individual agencies would be left to conduct business as they see fit, and artists would not be asked to sign new contracts. But even if Mr. Moneypenny does not aim to hijack the fashion world, as he told Fantastic Man magazine, he is looking to disrupt it. Great Bowery is making new hires who will focus on developing social media, branded content, endorsements and collaborations for artists companywide, and the agency plans to act as a producer of its artists’ projects, rather than merely a conduit to them. “We would all like to see the agency operate as a studio,” Mr. Moneypenny said, “packaging” projects (in Hollywood parlance) and marketing them itself. “That package doesn’t necessarily have to be fashion,” he added. “It could be a line of products for an electronics maker. It really could be almost anything.” His hope is that every qualified artist in the stable can become a polymath. He held up the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, whose archive Trunk licenses, as an example: They are in-demand photographers, working for Vogue and W, Chloé and Calvin Klein. They also design jewelry and a collection of jeans, recently published a career-spanning retrospective with Taschen and shot a music video with Paul McCartney, Rihanna and Kanye West. In his version of the future, deals similar to those might be worked through Great Bowery with a commission on each. “We really are the only ones who are attempting to change the game,” he said. Asked why, he shrugged: “Old dogs, no new tricks.” As is to be expected, Mr. Moneypenny’s competitors dispute this. Art & Commerce, where Mr. Moneypenny worked in licensing after ICM, is one of a handful of high-profile agencies that remains unaffiliated with Great Bowery. Along with the Wall Group, which represents primarily red-carpet stylists, it is owned by WME-IMG. Mark Shapiro, the chief content officer of WME-IMG, said that developing behind-the-scenes fashion talent into brands using all of the agencies’ channels, resources and relationships is top of mind. “Otherwise, frankly, we wouldn’t have bought the companies,” Mr. Shapiro said. “If someone wants to follow our model, all the merrier. We invite the competition.” He added: “Matthew has had great success in terms of the archive business that he built. Trying to jump into these waters is an entirely different story.” Another agency, the independent Art Partner, which represents some of the brightest stars in the fashion pantheon, including Mario Testino and Steven Klein, declined to comment. “I think we make our competitors very nervous,” Mr. Moneypenny said. “I’m not terribly concerned about any of them.” A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Fashion’s Agent of Change.

Depending on the work you need done and how quickly you want it to be finished, you may find yourself needing more than one laborer. This is important to consider because it may influence the pay rate you are willing to offer. Choices: 1. Estimate the number of laborers in your area, if not more. Know how much time it takes you to complete the work and the number of laborers you need to pay. 2. If your project requires lots of heavy lifting and/or moving large items, hire at least two workers. This will make the work go faster and will prevent a single laborer from becoming exhausted. 3. Obtain the detailed breakdown of worker's compensation compensation benefits. Since laborers do not need any variety of compensation in order to live permanently in the workforce, they might have to file taxes and have a lump sum deposited into their pay account once a month or after they retire. 4. Determine what your house's average pay range will be. There are a number of different types of laborers and many offer varying levels of pay. Answer:","output":"When determining how to pay a day laborer, it is important to take into account various factors, including the number of laborers you require, the specific tasks needed to be accomplished, and the desired timeline for completing the project. There are different options to consider when deciding on payment, including estimating the number of laborers, assessing the physical demands of the project, and considering worker's compensation. 1. Estimate the number of laborers in your area, if not more: Before beginning the hiring process, it is crucial to determine how many laborers you need to complete your project. Consider the estimated time for each task and the total working hours required. Having a clear idea of the number of laborers needed helps ensure that you can budget for their pay accordingly. This will also allow you to avoid hiring too few laborers, which could lead to delays or exhaustion among the workers, and prevent you from hiring too many laborers, which could result in unnecessary expenses. 2. If your project requires lots of heavy lifting and/or moving large items, hire at least two workers: Projects that involve significant physical labor, such as moving heavy furniture or construction work, will require at least two workers to ensure that the work is completed efficiently and safely. Hiring additional laborers for these tasks not only helps prevent injuries due to overexertion but also helps ensure that the project progresses smoothly and quickly. 3. Obtain the detailed breakdown of worker's compensation benefits: Day laborers may not have regular access to standard employee benefits such as health insurance or retirement savings. However, they still need to consider their financial security, both in the short term and long term. Therefore, it is essential to research and understand the labor laws and regulations in your area regarding worker's compensation, taxes, and other benefits that may apply to day laborers. Ensuring that your day laborers receive fair compensation, including any legally mandated benefits, helps build a positive working relationship and promotes their well-being. 4. Determine what your house's average pay range will be: Different types of laborers may come with varying levels of experience and skill sets, which should be taken into account when deciding on their pay. Perform some research to understand the average pay range for day laborers in your area with similar skills and experience. This will allow you to offer competitive wages that are attractive to potential laborers, while also ensuring that you are not overpaying for the services provided. In conclusion, when paying day laborers, it is essential to consider the number of workers needed, the nature of the work, and the legal requirements surrounding worker's compensation. By keeping these factors in mind, you can create a fair and attractive pay structure that will benefit both you and the laborers you hire, resulting in a successful working relationship that leads to the effective completion of your project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Andrew Nellis was spokesperson for this union , roughly from 2005 until his resignation in April 2011 . The next spokesperson was Karen Crossman . The union has adopted ' Working For Change ' as its official motto .  - Fixed income refers to any type of investment under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. For example, the borrower may have to pay interest at a fixed rate once a year, and to repay the principal amount on maturity. Fixed-income securities can be contrasted with equity securities - often referred to as stocks and shares - that create no obligation to pay dividends or any other form of income.  - The Ottawa River (Algonquin: \\"Kitchissippi\\"), is a river in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. For most of its length, it defines the border between these two provinces. It is a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River.  - A general union is a trade union (called labor union in American English) which represents workers from all industries and companies, rather than just one organisation or a particular sector, as in a craft union or industrial union. A general union differs from a union federation or trades council in that its members are individuals, not unions.  - Industrial unionism is a labour union organizing method through which all workers in the same industry are organized into the same unionregardless of skill or tradethus giving workers in one industry, or in all industries, more leverage in bargaining and in strike situations. Advocates of industrial unionism value its contributions to building unity and solidarity, many suggesting the slogans, \\"an injury to one is an injury to all\\" and \\"the longer the picket line, the shorter the strike.\\"  - To invest is to allocate money (or sometimes another resource, such as time) in the expectation of some benefit in the future.   - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Southern Ontario is a primary region of the province of Ontario, Canada, the other primary region being Northern Ontario. It is the most densely populated and southernmost region in Canada. Situated south of Algonquin Park, it covers between 14 and 15% of the province, depending on the inclusion of the Parry Sound and Muskoka districts. The region is home to one-third of Canada's population.  - Interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (\\"i.e.\\" the amount borrowed). It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party.  - The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), members of which are commonly termed \\"Wobblies\\", is an international labor union that was founded in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois in the United States of America. The union combines general unionism with industrial unionism, as it is a general union whose members are further organized within the industry of their employment. The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as \\"revolutionary industrial unionism\\", with ties to both socialist and anarchist labor movements.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.  - The City of Ottawa is the corporate entity of municipal government in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the course of a stream or river. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.   - A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.  - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals.  - A ladder is a vertical or inclined set of rungs or steps. There are two types: rigid ladders that can be leaned against a vertical surface such as a wall, and rope ladders that are hung from the top. The vertical members of a rigid ladder are called stringers or rails (US) or stiles (UK). Rigid ladders are usually portable, but some types are permanently fixed to buildings. They are commonly made of metal, wood, or fiberglass, but they have been known to be made of tough plastic.  - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean.  - Roza Dam ( National ID # WA00275 ) is a diversion dam on the Yakima River , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Yakima , just west of SR 821 . The dam , built in 1939 , is 486 feet ( 148 m ) long at the crest and 67 feet ( 20 m ) high , and impounds approximately 100 acres ( 40 ha ) of water . The dam also has 12,000 kW power production capacity , online as of 1956 . There is also an adult fish ladder at this location .  - Irrigation is the method in which a controlled amount of water is supplied to plants at regular intervals for agriculture. It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming.  - A reservoir (etymology: from French \\"réservoir\\" a \\"storehouse\\" ) is a storage space for fluids. These fluids may be water, hydrocarbons or gas. A reservoir usually means an enlarged natural or artificial lake, storage pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water. Reservoirs can be created by controlling a stream that drains an existing body of water. They can also be constructed in river valleys using a dam. Alternately, a reservoir can be built by excavating flat ground and/or constructing retaining walls and levees.  - A diversion dam is a dam that diverts all or a portion of the flow of a river from its natural course. Diversion dams do not generally impound water in a reservoir. Instead, the water is diverted into an artificial water course or canal, which may be used for irrigation or return to the river after passing through hydroelectric generators, flow into a different river or be itself dammed forming a reservoir.  - The Yakima River is a tributary of the Columbia River in south central and eastern Washington state, named for the indigenous Yakama people. The length of the river from headwaters to mouth is , with an average drop of . It is the longest river entirely in Washington state.  - The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A fish ladder, also known as a fishway, fish pass or fish steps, is a structure on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as dams, locks and waterfalls) to facilitate diadromous fishes' natural migration. Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term \\"ladder\\") into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.

Answer the following question: Background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Answer the following question: Process:  - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer predators happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that there will be fewer predators in the environment, leading to potential changes in the formation of fossils. This scenario can indeed have direct and indirect effects on the fossilization process. Direct effects of fewer predators on fossil formation: 1. Changes in the death rate: With fewer predators, the organisms' death rate might decrease as fewer individuals are killed for consumption. A reduced death rate will lead to a lower overall rate of organism remains being deposited in an environment conducive to fossil formation. 2. Changes in the availability of organism remains: The presence of fewer predators could result in fewer scavengers, which could mean that organism remains are not broken down into smaller fragments and instead left to decay on the surface. Surface remains are less likely to fossilize as they are exposed to weathering elements and are less likely to be covered by sediment. 3. Altered ecological niches: A decrease in the number of predators might change the ecological niche structure and open the door for different organisms to thrive. The change in species composition could impact the types of fossils that are formed and the frequency at which they appear. Indirect effects of fewer predators on fossil formation: 1. Changes in population size: With fewer predators, prey species populations might grow unchecked, leading to an increase in competition for resources and, ultimately, possible localized die-offs. These events could lead to a temporary spike in the number of organism remains that become available for fossil formation. 2. Changes in habitat structures: Predators can significantly influence their prey's behavior, and a decrease in predator numbers could lead to changes in habitat utilization by the prey species. This could impact various environmental factors, such as sedimentation rates, oxygen levels, and redox conditions, all of which can influence the fossilization process. 3. Changes in the diversity of decomposers: As mentioned earlier, since predators also regulate the populations of scavengers and decomposers, their decline in number may lead to changes in the rate at which organic remains are decomposed. This can either slow down or speed up the fossilization process, depending on the type and characteristics of the decomposers present. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis' proposed scenario of fewer predators can lead to direct and indirect effects on the formation of fossils. Changes in death rates, organism remains availability, ecological niches, population sizes, habitat structures, and the diversity of decomposers are among the various factors that can influence the fossilization process in response to a decrease in predator numbers. These effects can result in less frequent fossil formation or alterations in the types of fossils being formed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person whose team locates a living heir? A:","output":"The full name of the person whose team locates a living heir is Sir Cedric Willingham."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

We have: 0 = -105*p - 1380 + 256 - 451 First, we add the numbers together: 0 = -105*p -1380 + 256 - 451 = -105*p -1175 Now, we need to find the value of p that makes this equation correct. Since we have -105 multiplied by p, we can reverse the process by dividing both sides of the equation by -105. 0 / -105 = (-105*p -1175) / -105 0 = p + 11.19 Now, we just need to move the 11.19 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it: p = 0 - 11.19 p = -11.19 So the solution for p is -11.19.

Here is an article: Playing smart is always safer when shaping up in the summer heat and humidity, says Doug Casa, a spokesman for the National Athletic Trainers' Association. By Richard Hamm,, The Athens (Ga.) Banner-Herald, via AP If you don't enjoy swimming laps, water aerobics are a great alternative that let you beat the heat. By Richard Hamm,, The Athens (Ga.) Banner-Herald, via AP If you don't enjoy swimming laps, water aerobics are a great alternative that let you beat the heat. Enjoy yourself, Casa says, but don't be surprised when your performance and your drive droop. This is true whether you're a weekend golfer walking 18 holes, a teen heading to preseason high school football practice or a professional athlete. \\"People get into trouble when they think they can run as fast or perform any activity as well during the extreme heat,\\" Casa says. \\"It is just not going to happen.\\" There are some exceptions, of course — ice vests and ice collars have helped Olympic-caliber athletes train hard and compete at peak levels — but Casa's goal is to keep people healthy — and alive. He is the director of the Korey Stringer Institute at the University of Connecticut. Korey Stringer, an all-pro tackle in the National Football League, died of heat stroke complications 10 years ago after working out in inferno-like conditions. \\"The best thing to do is find some shade to work out in, or do your workout early in the day or later,\\" Casa says. \\"But still know that you can't handle the intensity you are used to.\\" Start slow: Even if you’re in great shape, acclimate to the heat over a number of days. Drink up: Hydrate yourself before and during your exercise to make up for lost fluids from exertion in hot weather. For every additional 1% of body mass you lose by sweating, says Doug Casa, your temperature rises half a degree Fahrenheit. “Hydrating is the most powerful tool you have,’’ he says. But avoid alcoholic drinks, coffee or soda because they can dehydrate you.Go skimpy: Wear light clothing that wicks sweat away from the body. Extra clothing exacerbates heat load. Ease up: At the first sign of heat illness, get to a shady place, drink water and cool off. Call 911 if the person’s temperature exceeds 103 degrees Fahrenheit, use ice packs or ice baths to begin cooling down the person while you wait for medics.No tough love: If you’re exercising with a friend or overseeing kids and they want to take a break, encourage it. If they ask for water, never withhold it.Source: National Athletic Trainers’ Association Heat-related illnesses are the No. 1 weather-related killer, accounting for about 700 deaths a year, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Knowing what to expect of yourself and how to identify heat illness can be a lifesaver. The early warning signs of heat illness are cramps, dizziness and headaches, nausea and thirst. Listen to your body, stop exercising, get out of the sun and cool off, Casa says. If you keep going, you could set yourself up for heat stroke, which can damage the brain and other organs and quickly lead to death. During heat stroke, the body temperature rises above 103 degrees Fahrenheit, the CDC says. The skin becomes red, hot and dry, and the body can no longer cool itself off. Emergency help is essential because the body's temperature can quickly escalate to 106 degrees and damage organs or lead to death. The speed in which heat illness can strike is why Casa says adult supervision of children and teens is crucial when they are involved in team sports. \\"You really have to heed those early warning signs,\\" he says. \\"What happens as heat illness progresses is the brain often becomes confused and you can't rely on it to tell you when to stop. \\" Kayaking is one of Barbara Bushman's favorite summer exercises. \\"This is a super total body workout as you generate your force from your core (rather than just your arms) and brace with your legs. Great for burning calories, and when you get too hot, you can jump in for a swim.\\" Summertime, and the workout is easy? Not necessarily so, says fitness expert Barbara Bushman. The dangerous heat wave moving into many sections of the nation does not have to cool off your desire to shape up. The editor of the American College of Sports Medicine's new book, Complete Guide to Fitness & Health, says to think outside the heated box. \\"If it is too hot outside, consider doing a power yoga workout inside using a DVD from your local library,'' says Bushman. \\"Or try a balance ball workout or dance video.\\" Or turn up the AC and set new goals by doing a Wii workout such as EA Sports' Active 2, billed as having aerobic, flexibility and resistance training. Other exercise alternatives Bushman suggests: •Get some wheels. Create your own breeze by biking or rollerblading. •Get all wet. If you're not a swimmer, try water aerobics or aqua running. •Get under cover. Take a dog and head out for a power walk at a shady park.

Which character was played by James Beck in the TV sitcom Dad’s Army?","output":"James Beck played the role of Private Joe Walker in the classic British TV sitcom Dad's Army. The show, which originally aired from 1968 to 1977, was created by Jimmy Perry and David Croft and has become iconic in British television history. Dad's Army revolves around the activities of the fictional Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, a volunteer defense force made up of local civilians during World War II. The show is often praised for its combination of humor and historical accuracy, as well as its engaging and memorable characters. Private Joe Walker, portrayed by James Beck, is a pivotal character in the series, known for his cheeky demeanor and resourcefulness. As a Cockney spiv, Walker is the local black market dealer, who always has a scheme or plan to make some extra cash. Despite his sometimes questionable actions and methods, Walker proves to be a valuable and loyal member of the Home Guard platoon, who uses his cunning and street smarts to achieve his goals. James Beck not only gave life to Private Walker's character but also contributed to the dynamic ensemble cast that made Dad's Army a popular success. The other main characters in the series include Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier), Lance Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn), Private Frank Pike (Ian Lavender), Private James Frazer (John Laurie), and Private Charles Godfrey (Arnold Ridley). Unfortunately, James Beck's time on the show was cut short, as he tragically passed away in 1973 during the sixth series of the show, at the age of 44. His sudden death had a profound impact on the cast members and the creative team. The show's writers, Perry and Croft, chose not to replace Beck's character, and the series continued without him for its remaining three series. Despite the loss of James Beck, Dad's Army has remained popular over the years and has been reprised in various forms, including stage shows and a 2016 feature film. Private Joe Walker and the other characters in the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard continue to entertain and delight audiences, and the sitcom's legacy is still cherished by many fans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before.

By pop singer Kim Wilde Steve took me out on a date to the iconic Langan's Brasserie in Mayfair right at the beginning of my career in 1981. I was very in awe of him only having just met him, but we quickly became friends and laughed at ourselves ordering sausage and mash with champagne. As we left, the press descended on us, we both pouted furiously and headed off to The Blitz club where we bumped into Marilyn and a host of exotic, beautiful New Romantics, drank vodka and crashed out at his apartment in Notting Hill. When I woke up in the spare room the next morning, I wandered through his elegant apartment to find him asleep with his eye mask on. I guess he didn't get to be that flawless without a beauty regime, he certainly had looked far more glamorous than I did the previous evening. Steve will be remembered as the most elegant and beautiful of the New Romantics at the beginning of the 80s. I'm so grateful that life brought Steve and I together, he was funny, great company and completely bonkers in the most adorable way. Born Steven Harrington, in Newbridge, Caerphilly county, Strange got involved in music after seeing the Sex Pistols in concert in 1976. He went to London aged 15 to work for Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McClaren before co-founding the Blitz Club in Soho, central London, which would become a focal point for the New Romantic movement. Bands including Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and Culture Club all got their start at the club before finding stardom. His band, Visage, formed in 1979 and their breakthrough single, Fade To Grey, peaked at number eight in the UK in 1981. It reached number one in both Germany and Switzerland, and was the first of five UK top 40 hits for the band, which also numbered Midge Ure and Rusty Egan among its members. Strange also starred in the video of his good friend David Bowie's number one single Ashes to Ashes in 1980. At the time, the futuristic mini-film was hailed as the most expensive pop music video in history. Strange - who admitted he faced drug addiction problems in the years that followed his early success - recorded a new Visage album, called Hearts and Knives, in May 2013, with the band boasting a new line-up. The band also recorded a new classical interpretation of Fade To Grey last year. In the intervening years, he had become a sought-after commentator on pop culture, appearing on a number of TV shows recalling the New Romantic era. In a nod to his involvement in the Ashes to Ashes single, he appeared as himself in the BBC One police drama of the same name. He also made a series of memorable appearances in BBC3 reality show Celebrity Scissorhands, winning the first series in 2007 and returning the following year as an \\"image consultant\\".

So, let's talk about it and try to understand what happened. In a place called Oxfordshire, there is a big open space where airplanes take off and land. This open space is called an airfield. An airfield is like a playground for airplanes, except that instead of swings and slides, it has runways and airplane hangars. One day, two men went to this airfield to fly around in a small airplane. The airplane they were flying is called a \\"light aircraft.\\" Light aircraft are smaller than the big airplanes you see at big airports. They are like little birds compared to big dinosaurs that can carry many people. Unfortunately, something went wrong while these two men were up in the sky. Their light aircraft had an accident and crashed onto the airfield. We don't know exactly what happened to cause the crash, but sometimes airplanes can have problems, just like cars or bicycles can. Both men in the airplane were very badly hurt and, sadly, they died because of the accident. This is a very sad thing that happened, and it reminds us of how important it is to be careful and always follow the rules when we do things like flying in airplanes or even riding our bikes. People who investigate accidents, like detectives, will look into what happened to try to find out why the light aircraft crashed. They will also try to learn how to make airplanes safer so that accidents like this don't happen again in the future. In the end, we must remember that accidents can happen to anyone, and we should always be extra careful and watch out for one another.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person whose thoughts on what inspired him to such an individual mode of expression art historians have struggled with?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

Evers was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of the five children (including older brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, eventually earning his high school diploma. Medgar Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist population were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife Myrlie had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing or other kind of attack on their lives. Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and one police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. Many believe that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan.  In the early morning of June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Evers's family had worried for his safety the day of his assassination and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt himself in a greater danger than usual. When he arrived home, Evers's family was waiting for him and his children exclaimed to his wife, Myrlie, that he had arrived. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read \\"Jim Crow Must Go\\", Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet ripped through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered 30 feet (10 meters) before collapsing. His wife Myrlie was the first to find him outside of their front door. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. His family explained who he was and he was admitted; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later. Evers was the first African American to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi, a questionable achievement for the dying activist. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000.  After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, Reverend Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came prepared with riot gear and rifles in case the protests turned violent. While tensions were initially high in the stand off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained nonviolence among their followers.

Blumas ended up playing Teddy as a sort of father figure. He began training to drive a Zamboni soon after arriving in Toronto; according to him, he later ended up smoothing the ice on some mornings at the rink where they were shooting.

She had to be on the ice longer than most of the other actors as she was one of the few adults on the film. She had stunt doubles to handle the falls and some of the complex moves, although Trachtenberg did learn a specific move that could not be done by a stunt double as the differences in their build would be apparent. She sustained some injuries while working on the film. According to Trachtenberg, a mistake was made in one of the physics formulas her character recites, which was later fixed; a shot of the back of her head was used and the correct term was looped in. Trachtenberg described the film as \`\`not a Disney kitschy movie'' and was somewhat apprehensive of the idea of a sequel for fear of belittling the original.

They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases.

When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband.

Write a title for this article: Robin Harper/Invision, via Associated Press BeyoncÃ© at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J. on Wednesday. EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. â At first it seemed that BeyoncÃ© was taking one of her pop-star nicknames, Queen Bey, all too seriously. Her show at the Izod Center here on Wednesday night opened with a bombastic orchestral dirge and a video presenting her as a Marie Antoinette figure in a Gothic palace, receiving a crown. But as the queenâs female retinue â wearing white unitards and hoops without skirts â reappeared onstage, the dirge segued into the martial beat of âRun the World (Girls).â BeyoncÃ©, shaking the epaulets on her shoulders and flipping her hair, was taking power not for herself but for her entire gender. The set that followed was not about aristocratic aloofness, but about energy, empathy and a beaming smile. It was the first stop in the New York region of BeyoncÃ©âs current tour, âThe Mrs. Carter Show,â which continues on Friday at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., and Saturday to Monday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Mr. Carter is, of course, Shawn Carter, better known as Jay Z; he didnât show up, though his recorded voice was heard in âCrazy in Love.â Except for its title, the two-hour show was no tribute to wifely self-effacement. It ranged through BeyoncÃ©âs repertory â all the way back to âSurvivorâ from her years with Destinyâs Child â to zigzag between romance and single-gal resilience, between making out and breaking up, often in successive tunes. Unlike Jay Zâs songs, which boast about his savvy, his possessions and his individual success, most of BeyoncÃ©âs music speaks for a high-achieving Everywoman balancing love and independence, pleasure and ambition. When she got to the line âIâm a host of imperfectionsâ in âFlaws and All,â she gripped and wiggled the skin on her upper arm, which was slightly less toned than the rest of her body. BeyoncÃ© hasnât released an album since â4â in 2011, though she has been busy since with motherhood â her daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born in 2012 â and performances this year including singing (along with a prerecorded track) at President Obamaâs second inauguration and doing the halftime show at the Super Bowl before going on tour. The newest song in her set, the Afrobeat-driven âGrown Woman,â was first heard in a cola commercial this year. But with a live band â all female musicians â she had new arrangements for some of the old songs. BeyoncÃ© has been headlining arenas on her own for a decade, and sheâs a song-and-dance trouper. âThe Mrs. Carter Showâ is a pageant of costumes â white lingerie, black leather, rhinestones, gauzy dresses, a glittery catsuit â along with choreography, fireworks and a second stage at the back of the auditorium, which she reached by traveling over the audience on a rope harness. Every detail was in place. Somehow, no matter where BeyoncÃ© placed herself onstage, an unseen fan was blowing back her hair, even when she was on her back atop a piano and singing a ballad, âSpeechless.â BeyoncÃ© matched her female dancers nearly strut for strut and shimmy for shimmy. But she didnât let dancing overshadow the music, and her voice shone. It held wounded fury in âIf I Were a Boy,â predatory sensuality in âFreakum Dress,â soulful indignation in âWhy Donât You Love Meâ and gospel exhortation in âHaloâ â which she preceded with an a cappella homage to Whitney Houstonâs version of âI Will Always Love You.â Even without a new album, BeyoncÃ© has less and less competition as an arena pop diva. She can play to a camera and ride a hip-hop track, but she also has the gifts of past soul generations. On Wednesday, she hit her notes and hit her marks, never showing the effort. She was a superwoman singing for Everywoman, smiling through all the ups and downs.

Answer the following question: Scientists have transformed men's minds into avirtual woman's body in an experiment that could throw light upon how humans distinguish themselves form others. In a study at Barcelona University, men wore a virtual reality headset that allowed them to see and hear the world as a female character. When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch . The more people reported being in the girl's body, the stronger physical reaction they had.\\" But in all cases, the feeling was temporary and lasted only as long as the study. The study shows that our minds have a very fluid picture of our bodies.

How many nautical miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

The researcher concludes that the organism is light sensitive. Which other explanation for the organism's response to the light is most possible? OPT: A). The organism avoids radio waves.. B). The organism avoids gamma rays.. C). The organism moves away from vibrations.. D). The organism moves away from heat sources..","output":"To determine the most possible explanation for the organism's response to the light, let's consider each option step by step: A) The organism avoids radio waves: Penlights emit visible light, not radio waves. It is unlikely that the organism's response is due to radio waves, as the penlight is not a source of radio waves. B) The organism avoids gamma rays: Penlights also do not emit gamma rays. Gamma rays are a high-energy type of radiation that typically comes from sources like nuclear explosions or cosmic rays. The organism's response is unlikely to be due to gamma rays, as the penlight is not a source of them. C) The organism moves away from vibrations: While a penlight doesn't directly cause vibrations, the researcher handling the penlight might cause vibrations in the container. This is a possible alternative explanation for the organism's response, as it could be sensitive to mechanical disturbances like vibrations. D) The organism moves away from heat sources: Penlights emit both light and heat. Since the organism moves away when the light is focused on the container, it is possible that the heat emitted by the penlight also plays a role in the organism's response. This explanation is also plausible because organisms may avoid heat to prevent overheating or to maintain a comfortable temperature. Out of these options, both C) The organism moves away from vibrations and D) The organism moves away from heat sources are plausible alternative explanations for the organism's response to the light. However, D) appears to be more directly related to the penlight, as heat is emitted along with the light.

Step 1: Identify what the user is asking for in the question: In this case, the user wants to learn about some examples of optical illusions. Step 2: Recall examples of optical illusions. There are many different types of optical illusions that can be categorized into various groups. Some examples of optical illusions include: 1. The Müller-Lyer Illusion - This illusion consists of two lines of equal length, each with arrows at the ends pointing in different directions. The line with the arrows pointing inwards appears to be longer than the one with arrows pointing outwards. 2. The Ponzo Illusion - This illusion features two horizontal lines of equal length that appear to be different lengths due to converging diagonal lines in the background, creating the perception of depth. 3. The Penrose Triangle - This is a triangle that appears to be connected, but upon closer inspection, it is impossible for the triangle to be structurally sound. 4. The Hermann Grid - This illusion consists of a grid with black squares and white lines. When we look at the grid, we perceive gray dots at the intersections of the white lines, but they disappear when we try to focus on them. 5. The Kanizsa Triangle - The illusion is formed by three Pac-Man-like shapes arranged so that their edges appear to form an upside-down triangle, even though there is no triangle in the actual image. Second question: How are optical illusions designed? Step 1: Identify what the user is asking for in the question: In this case, the user wants to know the process behind designing optical illusions. Step 2: Explain the design process for optical illusions. Optical illusions are created by artists and scientists who understand how our brains perceive visual information. These illusions are designed to exploit various perceptual and cognitive processes, such as pattern recognition, depth perception, and contextual cues. The illusions are created in such a way that they confuse or trick the brain into perceiving something that is not actually there or misinterpreting the visual information in some way. To answer the last part of your question: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question asks for examples of optical illusions, while the second question asks about the design process behind optical illusions.

Kanesatake Mohawk council rifts force early election Mohawks in Kanesatake go to the polls to elect a new band council leader today, five months earlier than planned after the existing council disintegrated into factions, paralyzing decision-making. Grand Chief Serge Simon, elected in August 2011 on a platform of unifying the community, lost the balance of power more than a year ago and often saw his faction’s decisions overturned as a result. With the council at an impasse, the chiefs agreed to hold a decision as quickly as possible rather than wait until the scheduled election in October, in order to resolve the crisis. “We spend our time arguing,” Simon said. “Who wants to come invest in a community like that?” Serge Simon, the outgoing grand chief in Kanesatake, told Radio-Canada of his community: “We spend our time arguing. Who wants to come invest in a community like that?” (Radio-Canada) Serge Simon, the outgoing grand chief in Kanesatake, told Radio-Canada of his community: “We spend our time arguing. Who wants to come invest in a community like that?” (Radio-Canada) For Simon, like the other two candidates running for grand chief, revisiting the governance model remains the priority. “What message are we sending to our youth?” asked candidate Sonya Gagnier, one of the dissidents on the current council. “We’re telling them that there’s no future here. We need to work together for the good of the population.” Robert Gabriel, a former band council chief who arrived late to the race, agrees that elected officials need to work hand-in-hand. But Gabriel said he considers economic development and land claims to be the real priorities. “My community is broken,” Gabriel said. “People have to be able to earn money, to work. For that, we need to take advantage of our land and the financial compensation we would get from the federal government if we were able to hold negotiations.” The governance issue has been a thorn in the side of the community for decades — complicating negotiations over Kanesatake’s unresolved land claim and exacerbating tensions in 1990. That’s when a dispute over the neighbouring town of Oka’s plan to expand its golf course led to a blockaded highway and the 76-day standoff now known as the Oka Crisis. Elections in Kanesatake are rarely popular. In the 2011 band council election, under 30 per cent of 2,100 band members deemed eligible to vote actually cast a ballot.

(Radio-Canada) “In 1991, they changed the voting system,” said political scientist Pierre Trudel of the University of Quebec in Montreal’s (UQAM). “At that time they were supposed to clearly define the roles of the chiefs and of the grand chief and name an elders’ council. But that was never done.” Conflicts have multiplied in the decades since then — coming to a head in January 2004 when dissident community members took over the band-supported police station and set fire to the home of former grand chief James Gabriel. Elections in Kanesatake are rarely popular. In the 2011 band council election, under 30 per cent of 2,100 band members deemed eligible to vote actually cast a ballot. According to candidate Gagnier, this speaks to “voters’ lack of interest and the large proportion of traditionalists.” Traditionalists reject any form of election that falls under the Indian Act and call for a return to the matrilineal system of government that existed before Canada was settled by Europeans. “Our ancestral methods allowed the tribes’ mothers to choose the leaders from among the children they saw grow up and become adults,” said John Cree, a man considered by many Mohawk traditionalists as their spiritual leader. “I don’t vote because I don’t recognize this voting method, which divides more than it brings people together,” he continued. Even so, Cree said he hopes the incoming chiefs will be able to restore harmony to the community.

Boosts Earnings Outlook Amid Financial Services Sector Strength, Announces End of Car Production at UK Jaguar Plant and Formula One Racing Exit\\" Article: DETROIT - Ford Motor Co., one of the world's leading automakers, raised its earnings outlook on Friday, attributing the positive revision to an impressive performance in its financial services sector. This announcement came alongside news that the company will cease car production at a Jaguar plant in Britain and withdraw from Formula One racing.  The revised earnings outlook highlights the substantial role the financial services sector plays in Ford's overall profitability. This sector encompasses the financing options provided to consumers for purchasing or leasing Ford vehicles and the financial tools offered to dealerships. The company's ability to generate higher than expected revenues and profits from its financial services arm signifies a strong market presence and efficient management of its financial products. However, the decision to end production at the Jaguar plant in Britain came as a surprise to many. Ford acquired the luxury car manufacturer in 1989 and has been producing vehicles at the plant ever since. While the reasoning behind this move is unclear, it could be linked to multiple factors, including the potential for reducing overhead costs, reallocating resources, or even refocusing on other segments of Ford's automotive portfolio. The loss of production at the Jaguar plant will undoubtedly impact local employment and the regional economy, raising questions about Ford's long-term commitment to maintaining its presence in the British market. In addition to ceasing production at the Jaguar plant, Ford Motor Co. announced its withdrawal from Formula One racing, a domain in which it has participated since 1967. Formula One has served as a competitive arena for top automakers, allowing them to showcase their technological expertise and driving prowess. It remains to be seen how this exit might affect Ford's brand image and future developments in automotive technology. These strategic moves demonstrate that Ford Motor Co. is navigating challenges in the automotive industry while seeking ways to maintain and enhance its profitability. The company's emphasis on its financial services sector demonstrates an ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences. On the flip side, the end of car production at the Jaguar plant and the withdrawal from Formula One racing underscore Ford's willingness to make difficult decisions that have a long-lasting impact on its brand and presence in certain markets and industries.  Overall, Ford Motor Co.'s revised earnings outlook signals the company's resilience amidst a rapidly changing automotive landscape. How the company will continue to adapt its strategies and maintain growth in the future, especially in light of decisions to retreat from certain ventures, remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the automaker's ability to find strength in its financial services sector offers a glimpse into the role that innovative financial tools and increased consumer access to credit could play in shaping the future of the automotive industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What impact does James Miles injury have on his life? Movie plot title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed... A:","output":"James \\"Boobie\\" Miles' injury has a significant impact on his life in the movie Friday Night Lights. After tearing his ACL, Miles is unable to participate in the playoffs and is left with a limp for the rest of his life. This serious injury not only affects his physical well-being but also shatters his dreams of playing big-time college football. As a result, Miles' once-arrogant attitude fades away, and he starts questioning his future, especially considering his less-than-stellar academic standing. The injury not only alters his football career, but it also impacts his mindset and forces him to confront a future that's different from what he had initially envisioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination.

Hydrostatic gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.

Would \\"With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"A Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance policy is a type of permanent life insurance that combines the features of universal life insurance with the flexibility of investing in a variety of sub-accounts, much like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Before analyzing whether the statement given is a reasonable answer, let's dive deeper into how VUL policies work. VUL policies have three primary components: 1. Premium Payments: Policyholders are required to pay premiums, which are often flexible, allowing the policyholder to decide the amount and frequency of premiums up to certain limits. These premiums fund both the cost of insurance, administrative fees, and any additional investments within the policy. 2. Death Benefit: This is the guaranteed payout to the policy's beneficiaries upon the death of the insured. With VUL policies, the policyholder can choose between two types of death benefits – a fixed face amount (also known as 'Level') or an increasing face amount ('Variable'), which includes the original face amount plus any additional cash value accumulated in the policy. 3. Cash Value: The investments made with the policy's surplus premiums (i.e., the portion not used for insurance costs or fees) are placed in the cash value component. Policyholders can allocate these investments among various sub-accounts with different risk and return profiles. The cash value can grow or decrease over time, depending on the performance of the sub-accounts' investments. If needed, policyholders can borrow or withdraw funds from the cash value without triggering a taxable event, as long as the policy remains active. Now, let's analyze the statement given: \\"With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out.\\" The statement refers mainly to a whole life policy, not a VUL policy. While both policies provide a death benefit and build cash value, their structure and flexibility are different. A whole life policy provides a guaranteed death benefit, a guaranteed cash value growth, and fixed premiums for the life of the policy. In contrast, a VUL policy offers a flexible premium structure, the possibility of choosing between different types of death benefits, and the option to invest in multiple sub-accounts. In conclusion, the given statement would be a reasonable answer provided the question was about whole life insurance policies. However, in the context of a VUL policy, it doesn't exactly address the working mechanism or unique features of VUL. Instead, a more accurate answer to the question of how VULs work should focus on the flexibility of premium payments, the different types of death benefits, and the investment aspect involved in the cash value component."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - get larger  - evaporation  - self destruction  - shrinkage  A:","output":"Cells in a hypertonic solution will experience shrinkage as water leaves the cell via osmosis.  Before delving into the details, it's essential to understand that in biological systems, the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane is affected by solute concentrations through a process called osmosis. In conditions of isotonicity, solute concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane, so there's no net movement of water.  However, a cell in a hypertonic solution is in a different situation. If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, the solute concentration outside the cell is greater than inside the cell. This difference in concentration sets up a concentration gradient that causes water to move out of the cell and into the surrounding hypertonic solution. This movement is due to osmosis, where water moves from areas of lower solute concentration (inside the cell) to areas of higher solute concentration (outside the cell) to achieve a balance. As water continues to leave the cell, the cell starts to lose its volume, causing a decrease in cell size—a process termed crenation in animal cells. This shrinkage may lead to significant changes in the cell's internal structure and functioning. For example, in red blood cells, shrinkage can lead to a disruption in the ability to transport oxygen efficiently. Further severe instances may even lead to cell death. This harmful effect is the reason why maintaining the right balance of fluids and electrolytes within our body systems is crucial for overall homeostasis.  It should be noted that the reverse process occurs when a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Here, the solute concentration is greater inside the cell than outside, and water tends to flow into the cell, causing it to swell or even burst in a process called lysis. In conclusion, when cells are placed in a hypertonic solution, they do not get larger, there is no evaporation involved, and it doesn't necessarily result in self-destruction (although it might in extreme situations). The primary response is shrinkage due to the outflow of water from the cells via the process of osmosis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues. This article is mainly about  _  .

Just three weeks ago, Uber and Lyft ceased operations in Austin, Texas, following a public referendum that imposed what the transportation network companies considered onerous regulations. And now, in what is arguably America’s second-largest hub of tech startup culture, a half-dozen new or previously lesser-known competitors are angling for a taste of the leftovers. “They left a factory overnight with the machines running and the workers standing by,” Joe Liemandt told Austin Business Observer of the sudden opportunity. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Leimandt is part of a team of local tech leaders working to build RideAustin, a nonprofit ride-hailing service that will channel some revenue to charity. RideAustin is still gearing up, and hopes to launch in June. Other alternatives are moving in fast. Boston-based Fasten will launch Austin service on June 1st, backed by 9.1 million in capital. Fare, produced by Phoenix-based Ride Fare, is already operating in Austin, and says it has processed 700 drivers through the first stage of Austin’s required background check. Dallas-based Get Me is already operating in Austin, along with zTrip and Wingz. There’s also Arcade City, which skirts the new regulations (at least, for now) by allowing drivers to negotiate their own rates, and is planning an app based on the Ethereum blockchain. For more on the Austin ride-hailing saga, watch our video: The Austin government is actively helping these new entrants, including by hosting a job fair and running a hotline to connect former Uber and Lyft drivers with new operators. Though losing one city won’t seriously slow down either Uber or Lyft, the rush of alternatives suggests some shortsightedness in their decision to play chicken with city regulators. While a ride-sharing service isn’t necessarily the easiest thing in the world to build, it also clearly doesn’t have the kind of technological moat that makes it irreproducible. The fact that this is Austin, a major hub of the tech business, has further implications. A foothold in the city could give companies a serious platform for going national, particularly with the huge visibility provided by the annual South by Southwest festival. Of course, the next SXSW is still nine months away, and it’s entirely possible Uber and Lyft will cave in and return to Austin by then. Summary:","output":"A few weeks ago, Uber and Lyft stopped working in Austin, Texas because they didn't like some new rules the city made. Now, many other companies are trying to do the same type of business that Uber and Lyft did in Austin. Some of these companies are called RideAustin, Fasten, Fare, Get Me, zTrip, Wingz, and Arcade City. The people who live in Austin now have other choices for rides while Uber and Lyft are gone. These new companies hope they can become popular and maybe work all over the country someday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Just as in English, the numbers 11 and 12 in German are outliers – they aren't formed the way the other larger numbers are. For this reason, it's easiest to learn them separately.  Eleven is \\"elf\\" (elf). Twelve is \\"zwölf\\" (tsvoolf). This is a deceptively difficult word for native English speakers to pronounce. The \\"teens\\" in German are formed similarly to the way these number-words are formed in English, although English actually gets a bit more complicated.  In German, all you have to do is take the word for ten, \\"zehn,\\" which you already know. On the front of \\"zehn,\\" put the word from one to nine that corresponds to the second digit of the number. So, for example, 13 in German is \\"dreizehn\\" (DRIGH-tsayn). Literally, you can think of it as \\"three and ten,\\" which add up to 13. All the other number-words in the teens are formed the same way, with stress always on the first syllable. The easiest way to learn to continue counting in German is to first memorize the words for the tens – 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. Many of these words are formed by adding \\"zig\\" to the word for the initial number, as you'll see:  Twenty is \\"zwanzig\\" (TSVAHN-tsikh). Thirty is \\"dreißig\\" (DRIGH-sikh). The \\"ß,\\" called an Eszett or scharfes S (sharp S), is a unique German letter pronounced essentially like the \\"s\\" sound in \\"kiss\\" or \\"bless.\\" Forty is \\"vierzig\\" (FEER-tsikh). Fifty is \\"fünfzig\\" (FUUNF-tsikh). Sixty is \\"sechzig\\" (ZEKH-tsikh). Seventy is \\"siebzig\\" (ZEEP-tsikh). Eighty is \\"achtzig\\" (AHKH-tsikh). Ninety is \\"neunzig\\" (NOYN-tsikh). Once you know how to count by tens and how to count from one to nine, you have all the building blocks you need to create virtually any other number in German.  Start with the smallest number, and work up from there to build the word. For example, 21 in German is \\"einundzwanzig\\" (IGN-oont-tsvahn-tsikh). A literal translation would be \\"one and twenty,\\" as \\"und\\" is the German word for \\"and.\\" All numbers up to a hundred are built this way, with the word for 100 being \\"hundert\\" (HOON-dert). The word literally means \\"hundred,\\" so 100 is einhundert. As you can probably guess, the building starts again here, the same as it did with the lower numbers.

Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now. Vic became a vegan later,and he is in a very good physical shape.  Which friend had a decreased blood flow to the heart?  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Fred is the friend who had a decreased blood flow to the heart.  Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30s, which can contribute to high cholesterol levels. High cholesterol is known to play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, where cholesterol and other materials become deposited in the arterial walls. This leads to the formation of plaques that can restrict or block the blood flow in blood vessels.  As a result, Fred's high cholesterol levels increase his risk for atherosclerosis, which can cause a decrease in blood flow to the heart. This can ultimately lead to high blood pressure, a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle, and even heart attacks due to complete blockage of blood flow. On the other hand, Vic became a vegan later in life and maintains good physical shape, implying that his dietary choices and lifestyle likely contribute to lower cholesterol levels and a lower risk of atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is less likely that Vic experiences decreased blood flow to the heart as compared to Fred."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was developed by the federal government as a segregated community?  The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.

A). no.  B). yes.","output":"B). yes. Katherine was unsuccessful in representing herself because she found the process so confusing that she gave up.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -203*k + 223*k + 40 for k, follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the coefficients of k. The equation has two terms with variable k: -203 * k and 223 * k. Combine these terms by adding their coefficients (the numbers in front of k). -203 * k + 223 * k = (223 - 203) * k (223 - 203) = 20, so the new equation is: 0 = 20 * k + 40 Step 2: Isolate the k term. To find the value of k, we need to isolate the k term on one side of the equation. In this case, we want to get k by itself on the left side and a constant term on the other side. First, we'll subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 40 = 20 * k - 40 This simplifies to: -40 = 20 * k Step 3: Solve for k. Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k, which is 20: -40 / 20 = 20 * k / 20 This simplifies to: -2 = k The solution to the equation is k = -2."},{"instruction":"Q:Build a movie plot around this: Who is Harrison accuesed of murdering?

While combing through evidence, Harrison begins to receive anonymous notes and messages, threatening him and his family if he continues with the investigation. Despite the danger, he presses on, driven by his commitment to uncovering the truth. Things take a shocking turn when the forensic team finds Harrison's fingerprints on the murder weapon and remnants of trace evidence leading back to his home. Harrison is arrested and accused of murdering Grace, causing a sensational media frenzy.  Faced with mounting evidence against him, Harrison is forced to go on the run, conducting his own unauthorized investigation to prove his innocence. He befriends a young reporter, Sara, who sees potential in Harrison's story and is eager to break the story of her career. Together, they piece together clues and chip away at the complex puzzle surrounding Grace's murder.

What is the answer: What does the Salk vaccine protect against","output":"The Salk vaccine, also known as the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), is a valuable immunization tool designed to protect individuals against poliomyelitis, commonly referred to as polio. Polio is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to severe complications such as paralysis, respiratory failure, and even death. The virus primarily targets the nerve cells in the spinal cord associated with muscle control, which can result in the temporary or permanent paralysis of various body parts. Dr. Jonas Salk developed the vaccine in the early 1950s, and it was introduced to the public on April 12, 1955. The Salk vaccine is based on inactivated poliovirus, meaning the virus has been rendered non-infectious through a process of chemical treatment, such as through the use of formalin. This inactivated form of the virus is unable to cause the disease but still maintains the capacity to generate an immune response when administered as a vaccine. Receiving the Salk vaccine trains the immune system to recognize and neutralize the live virus if the individual ever encounters it in the future. The inactivated poliovirus vaccine is administered through a series of injections given to individuals at specific ages. The recommended IPV schedule includes four doses, typically administered at two months, four months, six to eighteen months, and a final booster dose between the ages of four and six years. This schedule has proven to be highly effective in immunizing recipients against all three types of poliovirus.  The widespread use of the Salk vaccine, in conjunction with the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) developed by Dr. Albert Sabin, has significantly contributed to the near-global eradication of polio. Once a ubiquitous threat, the number of polio cases globally has reduced by over 99% since the implementation of vaccination efforts. According to the World Health Organization, only Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to have ongoing transmission of wild poliovirus. The highly successful polio vaccination campaigns across the world underscore the importance of the Salk vaccine in the fight against this debilitating disease. In summary, the Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine, provides vital protection against poliomyelitis, a disease that can cause severe paralysis or death. Through the widespread use of this vaccine and the oral poliovirus vaccine, global health organizations have made significant strides in controlling and nearly eradicating polio.

The state capital is Wiesbaden; the largest city is Frankfurt am Main. Until the formation of the German Reich in 1871, Hesse was an independent country ruled by a Grand Duke (Grand Duchy of Hesse). Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire cultural region of Hesse which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  - Giovanni Speranza ( born March 6 , 1982 in Giessen ) is a German - Italian footballer currently plays for Vietnamese side Dak Lak .  - Giessen, spelled Gießen in German, is a town in the German federal state (\\"Bundesland\\") of Hesse, capital of both the district of Giessen and the administrative region of Giessen.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where would you get a mailbox if you do not have one? Possible A: downtown area, front yard, obesity, post office, hardware store  Why is \\"hardware store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Hardware store\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. When considering the context of the question and the provided potential answers, we can deduce that the person is seeking a solution for purchasing or acquiring a mailbox, rather than a location for installing the mailbox. Since we are looking for a place where mailboxes are sold or distributed, we can evaluate each of the possible answers using human common sense. 1. Downtown area: While it is true that a downtown area may have retail stores selling various items, including mailboxes, it is a vague answer that does not provide specific information about where to find a mailbox in such a vast area. Also, not all downtown areas have stores that sell mailboxes. 2. Front yard: A front yard refers to a plot of land, usually located in front of a house or a property. It is a place where a mailbox could potentially be installed to receive mail, but it does not provide any information about acquiring a mailbox if one does not already have it. 3. Obesity: Obesity is an unrelated term, which refers to the medical condition of having an excess amount of body fat. It has no connection with purchasing or obtaining a mailbox. 4. Post office: A post office is a facility operated by a country's postal system to handle mail services, including sending, receiving, sorting, and distributing mail or packages. While some post offices may sell postal-related items, not all post offices sell or distribute mailboxes. Furthermore, in many countries, post offices are more focused on providing mailing services rather than selling physical items like mailboxes. 5. Hardware store: A hardware store is a store that sells various tools, equipment, and home improvement supplies, including mailboxes. People typically go to hardware stores to purchase items needed for DIY projects, home repairs, and installations, making it a logical place to find mailboxes for sale. In addition, most hardware stores carry an assortment of mailbox styles, sizes, and materials, making it possible for customers to choose a suitable mailbox for their specific needs. Based on the analysis of the provided possible answers, it is clear that \\"hardware store\\" is the most sensible and relevant answer. It aligns with human common sense because it is a place where mailboxes are commonly available for purchase, and people are more likely to find a mailbox there than at any of the other suggested locations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Everton F.C.: On 16 June 2006, it was announced that Everton had entered into talks with Knowsley Council and Tesco over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in Kirkby. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club's future by holding a ballot on the proposal, finding a split of 59% to 41% in favour.

I ordered this and still have not received it!!!!! I have written the seller and everything and still nothing....I am totally pissed!!!! Do not support this seller! The answer to this question is:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product due to several factors that the reviewer mentioned. It is essential to analyze the information provided in the review and what aspects could impact the buyer's decision. First, the reviewer expressed an admiration for the story line, which could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the product. However, this praise is not enough to outweigh the negative experiences they had with the transaction process. Second, the primary reason for the negative review is that the product was not received even after the reviewer contacted the seller. This issue would invoke concerns about the seller's reliability and trustworthiness. As a potential customer, it is crucial to feel confident that the purchase will be completed successfully and that the product will arrive as expected. Third, the reviewer's emotional state, as expressed by phrases such as \\"totally pissed,\\" suggests that this situation caused significant frustration and disappointment. It is an understatement of the dissatisfaction that the reviewer experienced, which could affect any potential buyer's decision-making process. Lastly, the reviewer directly advises other customers not to support the seller. This warning serves as a strong recommendation to consider alternative options when purchasing the product, as there is a potential risk of not receiving the item due to communication or shipping issues. In conclusion, this review would most likely decrease the chances of a potential buyer purchasing the product from this specific seller. The unfulfilled transaction, dissatisfaction, and the advice to seek out alternative sources all contribute to a less favorable view of the product and seller. As a prudent consumer, it would be advisable to investigate further and explore other options for purchasing the product from a more reliable and trustworthy seller."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In July 1449 Esen Tayisi  of the Mongols launched a large-scale, three-pronged invasion of China with his puppet khagan Toqtaq-Buqa. He personally advanced on Datong  in August. The eunuch official Wang Zhen, who dominated the Ming court, encouraged the 22-year-old Zhengtong Emperor to lead his own armies into battle against Esen. The size of Esen's army is unknown but a best guess puts it at some 20,000 men. The Ming army of about 500,000 was hastily assembled; its command was made up of 20 experienced generals and a large entourage of high-ranking civil officials, with Wang Zhen acting as field marshal. On August 3 Esen's army crushed a badly supplied Chinese army at Yanghe, just inside the Great Wall. The same day the Emperor appointed his half-brother Zhu Qiyu as regent. The next day he left Beijing for Juyong Pass. The objective was a short, sharp march west to Datong via the Xuanfu garrison, a campaign into the steppe and then a return to Beijing by a southerly route through Yuzhou. Initially the march was mired by heavy rain. At Juyong Pass the civil officials and generals wanted to halt and send the emperor back to Beijing, but their opinions were overruled by Wang Zhen. On August 16, the army came upon the corpse-strewn battlefield of Yanghe. When it reached Datong on August 18, reports from garrison commanders persuaded Wang Zhen that a campaign into the steppe would be too dangerous. The \\"expedition\\" was declared to have reached a victorious conclusion and on August 20 the army set out back toward China proper. Ask a question about this article.","output":"What were the key events and factors that led to the Ming army's retreat back towards China proper on August 20?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Cocum eatType pub; Cocum priceRange more than £30; Cocum customer rating low; Cocum familyFriendly yes. Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The given data set provides several key aspects of Cocum, which appears to be a dining establishment. A detailed description of the data points is provided below. 1. EatType: Pub - Cocum is characterized as a pub, which indicates that it is a casual dining establishment that serves both food and alcoholic beverages. Pubs, traditionally a community gathering spot, serve a wide range of dishes and drinks, often with a focus on locally sourced ingredients and regional cuisine. The pub atmosphere is typically informal and lively, making it an ideal destination for friends, families, and coworkers to meet, socialize, and enjoy a relaxed meal or drink together. 2. PriceRange: More than £30 - Cocum's price range is classified as more than £30, suggesting that the dining experience may be slightly upscale or that the menu offerings are perhaps more elevated than what one might find in a budget-friendly establishment. This price point signals to potential patrons that they should expect higher-quality ingredients, more complex or skillful preparations, and possibly a greater level of service than what would be expected at a lower-priced pub. However, despite the higher price range, affordability is still a consideration in catering to a larger demographic. 3. Customer Rating: Low - Cocum's current customer rating is reported as low, which implies that customers who have visited and experienced the establishment may have been dissatisfied with their experience. This less-than-favorable feedback indicates potential areas for improvement within Cocum's offerings, service, or overall execution. A low customer rating can be a strong deterrent for potential patrons seeking a pleasant dining experience, therefore, it is crucial for Cocum to identify the underlying issues and address them accordingly to improve its reputation and attract more customers. 4. Family-Friendly: Yes - Cocum is labeled as family-friendly, which means that the pub makes an effort to accommodate guests of all ages, including children and families with young kids. A family-friendly designation suggests that Cocum offers a welcoming atmosphere, and may have specific provisions such as a kid's menu, highchairs, or other amenities catered to keep younger patrons comfortable and entertained. This emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity can attract a wide range of customers, from families with young children to multi-generational gatherings, further diversifying Cocum's clientele. In summary, Cocum is a pub-style dining establishment with a price range of more than £30 per person, catering to a slightly upscale demographic. While it is family-friendly and accommodates guests of all ages, Cocum's current low customer rating indicates the need for improvements in its offerings or service quality. By addressing these concerns, Cocum has the potential to enhance its reputation and attract a diverse range of patrons seeking a welcoming and enjoyable dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This store needs to hire a professional manager with a customer and employee focused background.  It is clear from the reviews and recent interactions that this store does not value either of its greatest assets.    My brother Shovel S. posted his own review of his experience with this store.  He was laying flooring and wanted to rent a floor sander in order to level some rough spots on the concrete before laying hard flooring.  When he asked for this tool from tool rental the employee hooked him up with a floor scraper, the kind of device you would use to remove Kool Deck.  He went home, read the manual and realized it is not the right tool for the job and went back asking to exchange for the right tool.  The tool rental clerk and then an assistant manager were very rude to him and charged him over 100 because he left the store with a tool, even though it was the wrong tool and he didn't/couldn't use it.  As if he is supposed to know what Home Depot's iteration of two such similar tools looks like there at the tool desk all wrapped up.  He was just trying to get a job done on his precious weekend off.    After much argument with the assistant manager who insisted that it was store policy to take his money without providing him the proper tool, he left the store with 109 less dollars than he walked in with and his day wasted.  At this point he made a post to social media and I got involved.  As a management professional, his story was so appalling that I was compelled to call the corporate number to get to the bottom of why if a tool rental employee gives a customer the wrong tool the customer ends up stuck paying for leaving the store with the employees mistake.  The company does not have this policy in any other department.  I have returned dead plants, half used cleaning products that didn't really work as advertise etc and had no hassle.  Why would an unused rental tool be the subject of such a hard-line policy?  While talking to corporate I gave them the store number for the location in Tempe by accident since they are on the same street.  The manager from Tempe called me within half an hour but I realized it was the wrong store.  I called corporate with the correction.  Meanwhile the Tempe manager was quite appalled by what happened and made efforts to get the Laveen manager to make the situation right.  The Tempe manager called my brother to reach out.  The Laveen manager remained silent.  Not a peep.  I originally called corporate because the Laveen assistant manager claimed the hard-line policy on the tool rental was a corporate policy.  According to the Tempe manager this is not true.  I called to let them know that in the age of social media I and 200 of our friends had already seen his post about his experience being robbed and then insulted by the Home Depot manager.  We happened to have 2 birthdays in our friend groups this past week and at both events this experience was openly discussed.  I also told my neighbor across the street who I am close with.  We are big time gardening enthusiasts and we maintain our yards as well as the yards of a couple of elderly and part time resident neighbors on our street just to keep the neighborhood beautiful.  I spent nearly 1000 on plants and pool opening products this week and none of was purchased at HD as a result of this experience.  The manager at the Laveen store STILL didn't call me or my brother back, despite my brother calling the manager repeatedly and my lodging a formal complaint with corporate and even accidentally getting the Tempe store manager involved!  This is uncalled for.  Every day this unprofessional manager held my brothers money and did not reach out to resolve what should never have been a problem to begin with was another day we talked, the saga continued to unfold on social media and now onto Yelp and the manager continued to not reach out.    Finally, more than 48 hours later, fed up with being in limbo, having had the Tempe manager offer money out of his own pocket because of how ridiculous the situation was, my brother made a last call to Laveen and was finally able to talk to the manager.   The manager did not call my brother; he had to call and leave messages repeatedly, have corporate leave messages and have the Tempe manager make calls on his behalf and finally get through because of his own efforts.    The manager did process a refund of the 109 but the fact that it took 2 days and numerous phone calls and multiple people involved speaks of a highly ineffective manager with employees not even empowered to \\"make it right\\".  If you value your project time, shop at Lowe's or Tempe Home Depot.  This store doesn't have its act together and needs to invest in training.  With all of the hassle they put my brother through, leaving him with his project still undone, it is my opinion that they owe him more than just a refund.  If I was the manager he would have gotten a refund and 24 hours with the right tool on me.","output":"The review is decidedly negative. It outlines a narrative where the reviewer's brother suffers from not only poor customer service but also ineffective management at a particular store. Several key elements emphasize the negative nature of this review: 1. **Incorrect Product Sold**: The reviewer's brother was given an incorrect tool by the rental employee, which hindered his home improvement project and precipitated the problems that followed. 2. **Poor Customer Service**: When the brother attempted to rectify the situation by exchanging the tool, he was met with resistance from the rental clerk and an assistant manager showing a lack of proper customer service. 3. **Unfair Monetary Loss**: Additionally, the brother was charged over 100 for the incorrect tool - an expense he shouldn't have had to bear in the first place. 4. **Managerial Negligence**: The reviewer highlights that they made multiple attempts to get in touch with the store's management and corporate but were met with silence from the store manager.  5. **Endorsement of Competitors**: This negative experience prompted the reviewer to shop elsewhere, which led them to mention other stores that can better cater to their needs. 6. **Damaged Brand Reputation**: The reviewer discloses that they made the incident known to their social circles and social media, which could potentially harm the reputation of the company. 7. **Inefficient Problem Resolution**: Eventually, the money was refunded but only after significant efforts from the customer, thus highlighting the lack of effective problem-solving strategies from the company. 8. **Recommendation of Company Improvement**: Finally, the reviewer suggests that the store needs to invest more in their training, implying that the mistakes they experienced were due to a lack of staff education. Overall, the reviewer shares a frustrating experience with this store's management, customer service, and handling of mistakes, making the review broadly negative."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding  Paragraph: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group likely relies on confusing potential predators, group A or B? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators. This is because Group B lives in very large groups and moves in synchrony, which are behaviors associated with the confusion effect to evade and deter predators. In contrast, Group A lives in small groups, which doesn't support the confusion effect as effectively as larger groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: Hertz is the standard SI unit for the measurement of what?","output":"Hertz (Hz) is the standard SI (International System of Units) unit for the measurement of frequency. In scientific and engineering contexts, frequency refers to the number of oscillations, cycles, or repetitions that an event, process, or waveform undergoes in a given period of time. Specifically, one hertz represents one cycle per second. The unit is named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves and their properties. Frequency is a fundamental concept in various areas of science and technology, such as physics, acoustics, electronics, and communication engineering. It is essential for understanding the behavior and properties of periodic phenomena, like sound waves, radio waves, and electromagnetic radiation. In the context of sound waves, frequency is closely related to the pitch of a sound. Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds, whereas lower frequencies correspond to lower-pitched sounds. Musical notes, for instance, can be characterized by their specific frequencies in hertz. In the context of radio waves and telecommunications, frequency is essential for organizing the electromagnetic spectrum and assigning different frequency bands to various transmission channels and types of communication. This is crucial for preventing interference and ensuring the proper functioning of electronic devices and wireless communication systems. In the context of electronics, frequency is an important parameter of alternating current (AC) power systems, oscillators, and signal processing. Engineers must take into account the resonant frequencies and device tolerances when designing circuits and systems. To sum it up, Hertz is the standard SI unit for the measurement of frequency, which represents the number of cycles or repetitions an event or waveform undergoes per second. Frequency is a fundamental concept in various scientific and technical fields, such as physics, acoustics, electronics, and telecommunications, where understanding the behavior of periodic phenomena is crucial."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends. Today Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is. Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him. As I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too. I love the fact that we have a relationship that can be so open and honest, yet underlined with respect. It is his personality, understanding, humor, thoughtfulness, care, and mentorship that will always make him one of my favorite people in the world.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A Lesson in Love ( Swedish : En lektion i kärlek ) is a 1954 Swedish comedy film directed by Ingmar Bergman . The film is about the marriage of a gynecologist named David and his wife Marianne . The film 's score was composed by Dag Wirén .  - Ernst Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918  30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio. He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential auteurs of all time, and is most famous for films such as \\"The Seventh Seal\\" (1957), \\"Wild Strawberries\\" (1957), \\"Persona\\" (1966), \\"Cries and Whispers\\" (1972) and \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" (1982).  - The Seventh Seal is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \\"Wood Painting\\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\". Here the motif of silence refers to the \\"silence of God,\\" which is a major theme of the film.  - Fanny and Alexander is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 17 December 1982, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1900s. It was originally conceived as a four-part TV movie and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The TV version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut, at five hours and 12 minutes, is one of the longest cinematic films in history.  - Cries and Whispers (lit. \\"Whispers and Cries\\") is a 1972 Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film is set at a mansion at the end of the 19th century and is about two sisters and a maid who watch over their third sister on her deathbed, torn between fearing she might die and hoping that she will. After several unsuccessful experimental films, \\"Cries and Whispers\\" was a critical and commercial success. It received nominations for five Academy Awards. These included a nomination for Best Picture, which was unusual for a foreign-language film.    What is the relationship between 'a lesson in love' and 'drama film'? Answer:","output":"\\"A Lesson in Love\\" is a 1954 Swedish comedy film directed by Ingmar Bergman, who is known for directing multiple drama films, such as \\"The Seventh Seal,\\" \\"Persona,\\" \\"Cries and Whispers,\\" and \\"Fanny and Alexander.\\" While \\"A Lesson in Love\\" itself may not be classified as a drama film, it is related to the genre through its director, Ingmar Bergman, who has contributed significantly to the world of drama films."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Sara reveal to Grady? Movie title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.

At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain.  Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged? is inside the article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less..., can you guess it ?","output":"The name of the person in question is Camille Saint-Saëns. He was a French composer, organist, conductor, and pianist known for his numerous compositions and influence in the development of French opera. While two of his operas, Henry VIII and Samson et Dalila, received significant attention during his lifetime, it is only Samson et Dalila that has been regularly staged since his death. Despite the general neglect of most of Saint-Saëns's operas, they are considered important in the history of French opera, as they served as a bridge between Meyerbeer's style and the serious French operas of the early 1890s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This song became their signature and only hit when it was released in 1995. Deep Blue Something was formed in 1991 in Denton, Texas. Band members Todd Pipes, Toby Pipes, Kirk Tatom, John Kirtland and Clay Bergus had a collaboration to form this alternative pop/rock band. The lead vocalist of the band, Todd Pipes, and his brother Toby Pipes, who played the guitar, were the primary creative forces behind the band. The song \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" was a part of their second album \\"Home.\\" It reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart, thus providing the band with their biggest and best-known hit. The song's popularity led to the album's re-release in 1996 by Interscope Records. The song was inspired by the classic Audrey Hepburn film of the same name, although it tells a modern story of a couple considering ending their relationship due to a lack of common interests, save for one - a shared fondness for the film \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\".  The song's catchy melody and relatable lyrics connected with audiences around the world, contributing to its significant airplay on radio stations and on MTV. However, despite the song's global success, Deep Blue Something couldn't replicate this level of success with subsequent releases, and they eventually faded from the spotlight, becoming what's often referred to as a \\"one-hit wonder\\". In spite of their short-lived claim to fame, the song \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" continues to be a beloved one in pop culture, getting airtime frequently and even being covered by other artists over the years.

Answer the following question: Women consistently lie on social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter to make their lives appear more exciting, a survey has found. The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \\"diary-style\\" social media website. Researchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month. The survey of 2000 women found they mostly pretended to be out on the town, when in fact they are home alone, and beautify about an exotic holiday or their job. The most common reasons for women to write _ included worrying their lives would seem \\" boring\\", jealousy at seeing other people's more exciting posts and wanting to impress their friends and acquaintances. Psychologists suggested that as people attempt to stay connected on social media, they can in fact be left more isolated. They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel. According to the OnePoll survey, one third of women surveyed admitted to dishonesty on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter at some stage. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month while almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30 percent of women lied about \\"doing something when I am home alone\\", almost a quarter overstated their alcohol consumption while one in five were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs. Almost one in five women even lied about their \\"relationship status\\". \\"We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling,\\" said Dr Michael Sinclair, a leading British consultant psychologist. \\"Leaving out the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our 'friends online leads to less opportunity to feel empathized with, resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others. \\" According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because  _  . A) they have little fun in their daily lives B) they are not satisfied with their present life C) they want to entertain their friends and acquaintances D) they don't want to go out and communicate with others Answer:","output":"According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because they are concerned that their lives may seem boring, they may feel jealousy when seeing the more exciting posts of others, and they want to impress their friends and acquaintances. Therefore, the answer that best fits the provided information is B) they are not satisfied with their present life.  The passage emphasizes the pressure women feel to present a happier and more exciting life on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. It is suggested that this pressure comes from various sources, including the desire to avoid appearing \\"boring,\\" to compete with others who have seemingly more interesting lives, and to impress people within their social circles. As a result, the passage argues that women resort to exaggerating or outright lying about their daily activities, relationships, holidays, work, and other key aspects of their lives. Notably, the passage also introduces the idea that attempting to portray the perfect life on social media can lead to further isolation and dissatisfaction. Psychologists mentioned in the survey argue that by omitting the less desirable aspects of one's life in online communications, people miss the opportunity to feel empathized with and may consequently feel even more disconnected from others. In trying to present an ideal, happy image all the time, the efforts can become exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling. In conclusion, the passage suggests that women's decisions to lie on social networking sites stem primarily from their dissatisfaction with their present lives and the underlying pressure to create an appearance of an exciting and fulfilling life on social media channels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The right side of the equation has similar terms: -20 and -58. We can combine them: 29*y + 38 = -20 - 58 29*y + 38 = -78 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable y. We want to get y by itself, so we'll subtract 38 from both sides of the equation: 29*y + 38 - 38 = -78 - 38 29*y = -116 Step 3: Solve for y. Now, we'll divide both sides by 29 to solve for y: (29*y)/29 = -116/29 y = -4 So, the solution to the equation 29*y + 38 = -20 - 58 is y = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What self-proclaimed birthplace of surfing announced in 2011 that the activity would become (in 2013) an official college sport? What is the answer?","output":"The self-proclaimed birthplace of surfing that announced in 2011 that the activity would become an official college sport in 2013 is Hawaii. Specifically, the University of Hawaii (UH) announced that surfing, known locally as \\"he'e nalu,\\" would become an official NCAA-sanctioned sport. Hawaii, often regarded as the birthplace of modern surfing, has a strong and rich history with the sport. It has been an integral part of the Hawaiian culture for centuries, initially practiced by ancient Polynesians who used wooden boards to ride the waves. Surfing was eventually popularized in the early 20th century, with prominent surfers like Duke Kahanamoku, also known as \\"The father of modern surfing,\\" who helped put Hawaii on the surfing map. The University of Hawaii took strides in pioneering the recognition of surfing as a legitimate college sport after it saw an increase in interest and participation among students. The decision was influenced by several factors, such as the growth of various surf leagues and clubs on college campuses, the sport's global popularity, and greater competitive opportunities. This elevation of surfing as an official college sport not only provided scholarships and support to athletes but also helped increase the exposure and accessibility of the sport on a national level. As a NCAA-sanctioned sport, collegiate surfing is governed by standardized rules and regulations while emphasizing safety and inspiring athletes in both their athletic and educational pursuits. The inclusion of surfing as an official college sport has solidified its position within mainstream sports culture and continues to further its reach across the nation and around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I went to Las Vegas last week, and I figured what better way to fill in the after dinner 9PM - 11PM time slot than with a show. I've already seen pretty much all the big named production shows in Vegas, some shows even multiple times even (Cirque Du Soleil's O, Ka, Mystere, Jubilee, Le Reve, Penn & Teller etc). I haven't seen Mystere since the late 90's, so I figured I'd see it again, reminiscing old times. If I remembered correctly, Mystere had a lot going on everywhere, so in order to get the best view, sitting a little farther back from the stage was better. I bought 2 tickets in section 202 center for about 80 a ticket. Not bad for the seats, and price as the view was excellent, especially since it was right in the center!   Mystere was made back in 1993 by producer Franco Dragone, with music composed by Benoit Jutras. The same two also teamed up to make \\"O\\" at the Bellagio, and also teamed up to make \\"Le Reve\\" (non-Cirque du Soleil) at the Wynn.   Having seen \\"O\\" recently, and \\"Mystere\\" almost 10 years ago, I could see Franco Dragone's creative touches and influences in Mystere that shows up in a larger scale in \\"O\\". Mystere is like Franco Dragone's baby, and \\"O\\" is like the upgraded version of Mystere with water. Franco Dragone must love large stage lifts, as they are seen in Mystere, and also in \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\" but with the additional water component. (Side Note: Franco Dragone and Benoit Jutras recently made \\"House of Dancing Waters\\" in Macao, which from the previews seems like a combination of the best components of \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\". These two are amazing!).   I have to mention, the composer Benoit Jutras is a genius. There is nothing like a Cirque du Soleil show with music that we have no clue what they are saying. The music really adds to the shows. As mentioned above, Benoit Jutras made the music for \\"Mystere\\", \\"O\\", and \\"Le Reve\\", in which I love the music for all 3 shows.   I'd say if you've already seen \\"O\\" or \\"Le Reve\\" or Ka, you might have to think twice about seeing Mystere. If you really like the circus/acrobatics aspect without the flashy stages, Mystere I'd say has the best acrobatics/circus aspect than O, Ka, or even Le Reve. All the performers in Mystere make it look so easy. If your more into the large stages, then Mystere might be a disappointment. Although considering Mystere was made in 1993, the stage still seems amazing even for todays standards for me. I definitely had a good time, and I was entertained for the full 90 minutes.   Maybe its because I saw the 9:30PM show, but I was disappointed to see that a lot of seats were empty, especially on the sides....Options are: [A]. negative. [B]. positive. I think the answer is","output":"[B]. positive. To describe the sentiment of this review step-by-step: 1. The reviewer mentions they have seen many big-name production shows in Vegas and decided to see Mystere again after a long time. Justification: This establishes their background and experience with similar shows. 2. They talk about the ticket pricing and consider the view from their seat as excellent. Justification: Mentioning the excellent view and the reasonable price indicates a positive aspect of their experience. 3. The reviewer compares Mystere to other shows like \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve,\\" discussing the similarities between their creators. Justification: By highlighting the creators' collaborations and achievements, they are adding a positive context around Mystere. 4. The reviewer praises the composer Benoit Jutras, calling him a genius and expressing their love for the music. Justification: This appreciation for the music adds a positive element to their overall sentiment. 5. The reviewer suggests that if someone has already seen other popular shows, they might need to consider whether to see Mystere, but highlights the superior acrobatics aspect of Mystere. Justification: They provide a balanced perspective, suggesting that Mystere has its strengths, while acknowledging that it might not be for everyone. 6. The reviewer shares that they were entertained for the full 90 minutes of the show. Justification: The fact that they were entertained for the entire duration suggests a positive sentiment. 7. The only negative aspect mentioned is the empty seats, which is not a critique of the show itself.

Question: when did the mining town of monte cristo cease operations and become all but abandoned?? Answer:","output":"To find the answer to this question, I will perform the following steps: 1. Research the history of the mining town of Monte Cristo. 2. Identify when the mining operations ceased and the town became all but abandoned. Step 1: Research the history of the mining town of Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo is a ghost town located in the Cascade Mountains in Snohomish County, Washington, in the United States. The town was founded in the early 1890s as a mining community, with gold and silver being extracted from nearby mines. Step 2: Identify when the mining operations ceased and the town became all but abandoned. Mining operations in Monte Cristo started to decline by the late 1890s and early 1900s, mainly due to the challenges of transporting the ore and the decreasing quality of the deposits. By 1907, the town's population significantly decreased, and the railroad that led to Monte Cristo was abandoned in 1920, making the town all but abandoned. In conclusion, the mining town of Monte Cristo ceased operations and became all but abandoned around 1907, with its isolation becoming more pronounced after the abandonment of the railroad in 1920."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How can I be better at physics? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available options: [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"[II] yes; These two questions are inquiring about the same information. Both questions are asking for advice on how to improve in physics. Now, let's discuss the steps to get better at physics: 1. Understand the fundamentals: Make sure you have a strong foundation in the basic concepts of physics, such as mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and thermodynamics. This will make it easier to build on your knowledge as you progress. 2. Engage in active learning: Don't passively read or listen to lectures; engage with the material by asking questions, discussing concepts, and solving practice problems. 3. Solve a variety of problems: Focus on different types of problems that cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. This will help you develop a broader understanding of physics and improve your problem-solving skills. 4. Be consistent and organized: Set aside some time each day to study physics, and make a schedule to keep track of your progress. Organize your study materials and notes in a way that makes it easy for you to review and understand the contents. 5. Use multiple resources: Don't rely solely on one textbook or lecture series. Consult a variety of resources, such as online videos, tutorials, and forums, to deepen your understanding of the subject matter. 6. Visualize concepts: Many physics concepts can be better understood by visualizing them in your mind or sketching them out on paper. This helps you gain a deeper understanding of the principles at play. 7. Seek help when needed: Don't be afraid to ask your teacher, peers, or online forums for help when you're stuck on a concept or problem. It's better to clarify your doubts early on rather than let them snowball into larger misconceptions. 8. Teach or explain to others: When you explain a physics concept or problem to someone else, it forces you to thoroughly understand the topic and clarify it in your own mind. 9. Review and practice regularly: Periodically review your notes and practice problems to reinforce your knowledge and keep it fresh in your mind. This will help when you come across new material that builds on the previous concepts. 10. Stay curious and perseverant: Embrace the challenges that physics presents and remain curious about the subject. Keep pushing yourself to improve, and don't be deterred by setbacks or difficulties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

First, we need to solve -7154 + 12566. To do this, imagine you have a big jar with 7154 blue balls (these are negative), and you want to replace them with 12566 red balls (these are positive). You take away all the blue balls and still have to add more red balls.  You need to add 12566 - 7154 = 5412 red balls to the jar. Now our equation looks like this: 5412 = 164 * c. To find the value of 'c', we need to know how many times 164 can fit in 5412. It's like asking how many groups of 164 red balls can you make from the total of 5412 red balls. So, we will divide 5412 by 164: 5412 ÷ 164 ≈ 33. Therefore, the answer is c = 33.

Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent.

The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons.

Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron.

When World War II started, the Taylor moved to Beverly Hills, California, and there Elizabeth started acting in movies. After her success as a child star, Taylor had no trouble moving into adult roles and won twice for Best Actress:Butterfield8 (1960) andWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? (1966) Taylor's fame and popularity gave her a lot of power with the movie industry, so she was able to demand very high pay for her movies.

Sentence: \\"The cat touched.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Choose from: --unacceptable --acceptable","output":"To determine the acceptability of the sentence \\"The cat touched,\\" I'll consider its grammatical structure, word usage, and context. Step 1: Examine grammatical structure. The sentence has a subject, \\"The cat,\\" and a verb, \\"touched.\\" From a grammatical standpoint, the sentence is complete, as it has both a subject and a verb, which are the minimum requirements for a sentence. Step 2: Consider word usage. The verb \\"touched\\" is a transitive verb, which typically requires a direct object to follow it. In this sentence, the verb \\"touched\\" is used without a direct object. Step 3: Context. The context of the sentence is unclear. Since there is no direct object to indicate what the cat has touched, it is difficult to understand the complete meaning of the sentence. Taking these factors into account, a linguist might rate the sentence as \\"unacceptable\\" due to the transitive verb \\"touched\\" being used without a direct object, making the intended meaning unclear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Staff training must have a purpose, which I defined  when a firm considers its training needs, which are in turn based on job descriptions and job specifications. A job description should give details of the performance that is required for a particular job, and a job specification should give information about the behaviour, knowledge and skills that are expected of an employee who works in it. When all of this has been collected, it is possible to make a training specification. This specifies that the training department must teach for the successful performance of the job, and also the best methods to use in the training period. There are many different training methods, and there are advantages and disadvantages of all of them. Successful training performances depend on an understanding of the difference between learning about skills and training in using them. It is frequently said that  learning about skills takes place \\"off the job\\" in classroom, but training in using these skills takes place \\"on the job,\\" by means of such activities as practice in the workshop. It's always difficult to evaluate the costs of a training programme. The success of such a programme depends not only on the methods used but also on the quality of the staff who do the training. The evaluation of management training is much more complex than that. From the passage we know the success of a training programme lies in_. A) the training methods and the quality of the training staff B) the performance of the trainees in the programme C) the places where the training programmes take place D) the way to evaluate the training programme Answer:","output":"A) the training methods and the quality of the training staff"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset. But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost. I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \\"A Time to kill\\" , and the \\"The Newton Boys \\" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work. However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view. The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com. So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \\"A Time to kill\\" , \\"The Newton Boys \\" \\"Frailty\\", \\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\\", \\"Edtv\\" and \\"Amistad\\" and avoid too \\"Larger Than Life\\" and \\"Angels in the Outfield\\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.\\"? Answer:","output":"Analyzing the passage provided, here are some possible questions: 1. What was the last major building work that happened, and when did it occur?    In this question, students should identify that the last major building work took place during the reign of King George V in 1913. 2. Who was the architect responsible for the redesign of Blore's 1850 East Front and what was his reference design for the work?    This question tests the students' understanding of specific details. The answer should involve Sir Aston Webb as the architect and Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire as his reference. 3. What was the purpose of Aston Webb's redesigned façade?    The students should identify that it was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial—a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria. 4. How did George V's reign differ from his father's in terms of palace activities?    Learners should note that there was a greater emphasis on official entertaining and royal duties during George V's reign, in contrast to the lavish parties during his father's reign. 5. What notable performances were organized during George's V reign and what was the recognition received?    Students must identify the jazz performances from various musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong, and the nomination the palace received in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque. 6. Who was Queen Mary and what was her contribution to the arts?    Students are expected to discuss Queen Mary as George V's wife, her interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, and her role in restoring and adding to it. 7. Mention some of the specific contributions of Queen Mary to the palace.    The students should talk about how Queen Mary had new fixtures and fittings installed, including the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, and her responsibility for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. 8.

Yes or no? Answer: One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of \\"overall health service performance\\", which used a \\"composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution\\", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations. Question: how is canada's health care","output":"system different from the United States' health care system? The health care systems in Canada and the United States differ significantly, with each country utilizing a unique approach to providing health care services to their residents. The most prominent difference lies in the funding and organization of services. The main aspects that contribute to these differences include the funding models, accessibility of care, administration, and the role of private organizations. 1. Funding Models: Canada has a publicly funded health care system, known as Medicare, which is financed primarily through tax revenues. The federal government sets the overall health policy, but each province and territory is responsible for administering and delivering health care services to its residents. In contrast, the United States has a mixture of public and private funding. Public funding is provided through programs such as Medicare (for individuals aged 65 and above) and Medicaid (for individuals with low income), while private funding is facilitated through employer-sponsored health insurance programs or individual market plans. 2. Accessibility of Care: In Canada, all citizens and permanent residents have access to necessary medical services regardless of their income levels or ability to pay, owing to its universal health care coverage. However, some services like prescription medication, dental care, and vision care might not be covered, and waiting times for certain medical procedures can be long. In the United States, access to health care services is largely contingent upon a person's insurance coverage, which means that those without insurance or with inadequate coverage may face significant barriers accessing care. Moreover, the uninsured population and high costs of care can lead to many people delaying or forgoing necessary medical treatments. 3. Administration: Since the Canadian health care system is publicly funded, it has a lower administrative overhead as compared to the multi-payer system in the United States. The healthcare providers in Canada primarily interact with a single payer (the government) to receive payments for services rendered. In the United States, however, providers usually have to deal with various insurance providers and processes, leading to higher administrative costs and complexities. As a result, the United States spends a significantly larger proportion of its GDP on health care administration as compared to Canada. 4. Role of Private Organizations: In the Canadian health care system, the private sector functions as a supplemental system. Private health insurance can be obtained to cover services not included under the public system, such as dental care, vision care, and prescription medications. In the United States, the role of private organizations is much more significant, as private insurance companies play a lead role in financing and providing health care services, especially through employer-sponsored health plans. Additionally, a large percentage of health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics, are private or run by non-profit organizations. In conclusion, the Canadian and American health care systems differ primarily in their funding structures, with Canada opting for a public, single-payer system offering universal coverage, while the United States relies on a mixed system of public and private funding. These differences result in disparities in accessibility of care, administrative costs, and the overall role of private organizations within their respective health care systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Changing populations have happened in timber and mining towns in the American West as a result of boom and bust economic cycles. Some towns decrease in population following a bust, while some, like Arcata, experience a change in demographics. In the case of Arcata, the peak and the bust were close due to Arcata’s relatively late entry into the timber industry, and its domination by mechanization. The population of the city of Arcata was 3,729 during its peak 1950, when lumber was exported throughout the country and abroad. For the County of Humboldt, After the bust, in 1955, the population of Arcata in 1960 was 5,235. In Arcata the population under the age of 15 was 28.1%. Those age 15-24 made up 22.8% of Arcata’s population. Those age 25-39 made up 19.4% of the population. Those age 40-54 made up 16% of Arcata’s population.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ann Ree Colton ( Born 1898 ) founded the system of Niscience , a word she coined meaning to know beyond intellectual knowledge , \`\` superconscious knowing , '' she called it .  - The New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of \\"spiritual\\" and rarely use the term \\"New Age\\" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term, believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon. As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling....  - Niscience is a religious movement of the United States. Its parent organization, the Ann Ree Colton Foundation of Niscience, was founded in 1953 by Ann Ree Colton. It is characterized as a combination of Christianity and New Age spirituality, and combines the teachings of Jesus Christ with an engagement with meditation. Overview. The Ann Ree Colton Foundation of Niscience, located in Glendale, California, was co-founded in 1953 by Ann Ree Colton and her husband Jonathan Murro.    What is the relationship between 'ann ree colton' and 'glendale'? Answer:","output":"Ann Ree Colton, born in 1898, was an American spiritual leader who founded the system of Niscience, which she described as a way of knowing beyond intellectual knowledge or \\"superconscious knowing.\\" Niscience is a religious movement in the United States that is characterized as a combination of Christianity and New Age spirituality, combining the teachings of Jesus Christ with meditation practices.

This foundation serves as the parent organization for the Niscience movement and demonstrates Glendale's significance as the location where Ann Ree Colton established her teachings and developed the spiritual community that supports Niscience principles and practices. The foundation's location in Glendale played a crucial role in the spread and growth of Niscience as part of the broader New Age movement that became influential in the United States during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. The New Age movement is a diverse and eclectic spiritual phenomenon that incorporates various esoteric beliefs and practices, drawing from a wide range of religious traditions, including Christianity, occultism, Spiritualism, UFO religions, and the Human Potential Movement. In summary, the relationship between Ann Ree Colton and Glendale is significant because Glendale, California, is where she and her husband established the Ann Ree Colton Foundation of Niscience, which serves as the central organization and spiritual hub for the Niscience community.

Write an article with the title: \\"How to select the right lender when buying a home\\"","output":"Title: How to Select the Right Lender When Buying a Home Introduction: Purchasing a home is one of the most significant financial decisions most people will make in their lives. Because of the size and complexity of the investment, it's important to choose the right lender when navigating the mortgage process. The right lender can make the home-buying experience smoother, more efficient, and potentially save you money. In this article, we will discuss key factors to consider when selecting a lender for your home purchase. 1. Research and compare loan options: Start by researching various home loan packages available in the market. Determine which type of mortgage best suits your financial situation, whether it’s a fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, or interest-only loan. Compare interest rates, loan terms, and required down payment amounts offered by different lenders. Be sure to inquire about any additional costs or fees associated with the loan, such as application fees, appraisal fees, closing costs, and points. 2. Get pre-approved: After familiarizing yourself with various loan options, approach multiple lenders and get pre-approved. A pre-approval letter demonstrates to sellers that you are a serious and qualified buyer. This process will also give you a better understanding of the loan amount you qualify for and the interest rate you can expect. Remember, obtaining pre-approval does not commit you to a specific lender, and it's a good way of comparing offers from different lenders. 3. Assess lender's reputation: Check lender reviews and testimonials online, focusing on factors such as customer satisfaction, responsiveness, and transparency. Ask friends, family members, or your real estate agent for recommendations. Additionally, you can consult with a professional financial advisor for impartial guidance. 4. Evaluate customer service: When working with a lender, prompt and clear communication is crucial. Be sure to gauge their responsiveness and willingness to answer your questions or address your concerns. The quality of customer service can make a significant difference in your overall experience. Look for a lender who is easy to reach, preferably both via phone and email, to ensure timely and efficient communication. 5. Consider local versus national lenders: Local lenders may have a more comprehensive understanding of your specific market, potentially offering more personalized service and tailored loan options. On the other hand, national lenders may provide a greater variety of loan products and competitive rates due to larger resources and networks. Weigh the benefits each type of lender provides and decide which best suits your needs. 6. Confirm lender's expertise: Ensure the lender you choose has experience handling mortgage loans similar to yours, particularly if you have a unique financial situation or require a specialized loan product. You might need a lender with expertise in first-time homebuyer programs, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, Veterans Affairs (VA) loans, or jumbo loans, as examples. Ask potential lenders about their experience and success rates in managing these specific loan types. 7. Read the fine print: Always read loan documents thoroughly before signing, and make sure you understand all terms and conditions, including any penalties for early repayment or missing a payment. If you are unsure of any aspect of the documents, consult with a professional or request clarification from the lender. Conclusion: Selecting the right lender is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of purchasing a home. By conducting thorough research, comparing loan options, evaluating customer service and expertise, assessing reputations, and reading the fine print, you can maximize your chances of securing favorable terms and a smooth mortgage process. In the end, the right lender will empower you to make informed financial decisions that will best serve you and your new home for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Chinese President Hu Jintao has promised to maintain economic growth to support a global recovery, at the start of an Asia-Pacific summit in the Russian port city of Vladivostok.","output":"Title: Chinese President Hu Jintao Pledges Support for Global Economic Recovery at Asia-Pacific Summit Introduction: At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vladivostok, Chinese President Hu Jintao emphasized the importance of sustained economic growth for both China and the global community. With the world economy currently experiencing a slow recovery from the financial crisis, it is crucial to understand the role of China, the world's second-largest economy, in leading the charge towards financial stability and improved living standards. Economic Growth: Maintaining and Bolstering China's Role in Global Recovery China's rapid economic growth has not only had a significant influence on the national level, but also on the surrounding region and the global economy as a whole. As President Hu Jintao remarked, \\"China's economic growth is of great importance to global recovery.\\" With a determination to maintain a strong economy, China has initiated several measures aimed at realizing this goal, including financial deregulation, domestic consumption stimulation, and economic restructuring. These actions not only have the potential to positively impact the livelihoods of Chinese citizens but also the overall health of the international economy. Infrastructural Development: Investments in Transportation and Energy One essential factor in supporting a nation's economic growth is the improvement of its infrastructure. China has made substantial investments in transportation and energy since the 2008 financial crisis. These investments have increased employment opportunities and facilitated the movement of goods and services across the country. This emphasis on infrastructural development has improved overall efficiency and productivity in China while also raising its GDP, providing much-needed support to the global economic recovery. Trade: Regional and International Integration Trade has been the primary driver of China's economic boom in recent decades, with the nation consistently reporting trade surpluses year after year. By fostering partnerships and economic cooperation, China has indeed become an essential link in the global trading system. At the APEC summit, Hu Jintao expressed his intention to strengthen trade relations with both regional and international partners, which will contribute to global economic stability. Furthermore, China's commitment to lowering trade barriers and increasing transparency within the financial sector should promote a more equitable distribution of resources across the world. Removing excessive trade restrictions and striving for efficient cross-border business procedures will only serve to enhance the global trading landscape. Sustainable Development and Climate Change In his speech, President Hu also touched upon the importance of achieving sustainable development and addressing climate change. He acknowledged that China faces a \\"daunting task\\" of managing its resources and environment. As a major producer of greenhouse gas emissions, China plays a pivotal role in combating global warming and implementing environmental initiatives. With burgeoning economic growth comes the responsibility to ensure sustainability, bolster clean energy initiatives, and transition to a green economy. By investing in renewable energy and implementing policies that minimize pollution and waste, China is actively contributing to creating a healthier planet for future generations. Conclusion: Chinese President Hu Jintao's pledge to maintain economic growth to support global recovery at the Asia-Pacific summit highlights the essential role China plays in shaping the future well-being of the world. As the nation continues to implement policies that bolster its economy, invest in its infrastructure, and champion sustainable development, it is ultimately contributing to an improved global standard of living. China's impact on the global recovery process should serve as an example for other nations to follow in their quest for economic progress and environmental responsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman suffered amnesia. cause:","output":"In order to determine the cause of the woman's amnesia, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Gather relevant information about the patient's history To understand the cause of amnesia, it's essential to collect information about the patient's medical history, any recent accidents, or incidents they experienced. This can provide valuable context for identifying the cause of her amnesia. Step 2: Conduct a physical examination and review medical tests A thorough physical examination and reviewing any medical test results can provide insight into any underlying medical issues that may be contributing to the patient's amnesia. Tests such as brain scans (MRI, CT) or blood tests can help identify any abnormalities or deficiencies. Step 3: Evaluate for potential psychological factors Assessing the patient's mental health and stress levels can help determine if her amnesia has a psychological origin, such as dissociative amnesia, which can occur after traumatic or highly stressful events. Step 4: Review any medications or substances the patient is using Some medications or substances, such as excessive alcohol consumption or certain prescription medications, can cause transient amnesia. Reviewing the patient's current medications or substance usage could help identify a cause. Step 5: Consider any external factors or lifestyle changes Major life changes, extreme stress, or changes in the patient's environment can sometimes lead to memory issues. Investigating these areas can help rule out external factors as the cause of her amnesia. Step 6: Review findings and identify possible causes After gathering and evaluating all of the information, potential causes can be identified based on the different symptoms, medical and psychological history, and other relevant details. In summary, to determine the cause of the woman's amnesia, it's important to consider her medical history, physical examination results, psychological evaluation, medications/substances usage, and external factors. Through careful analysis of this information, a conclusion about the cause of her amnesia can be reached."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less birth control pills used happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves changing the usage of birth control pills in the context of weathering of wood. To determine if it has a direct or indirect effect, let's examine the process of weathering and the potential implications of using fewer birth control pills. The weathering process: 1. Rain falls on wood 2. The rain seeps into the wood surface 3. It permeates the wood 4. When the rain evaporates, it leaves the wood 5. It takes the finish of the wood with it 6. The wood begins to lose its luster 7. It begins to look bad 8. It has pieces of paint missing from the rain 9. It gets worse when it rains 10. It eventually will have no paint left Now, let's consider the implications of using fewer birth control pills. With less usage of birth control pills, we can assume that there may be an increase in the population, which could lead to higher demand for resources, urbanization, and possibly an increase in pollution. Although there might be some indirect linkages between these factors and weathering, they are relatively weak and far removed from the primary drivers of weathering (such as precipitation, temperature, and biological factors). Considering the steps in the weathering process, there is no clear indication that the usage of birth control pills, either more or less, would have any direct effect on the weathering on wood. In conclusion, while there might be some indirect connections between the usage of birth control pills and the factors influencing woodworking, they are not strong enough to suggest any causality between the two. Therefore, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation does not have a significant effect (direct or indirect) on the weathering process of wood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is Stan?, using the article: During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon.

You are given a new situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect.  and a hint : All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.  Please answer this question : Which species would have higher chance of passing their genes on to the next genertion, rhino or impala? A:","output":"Based on the given situation and the hint provided, it can be inferred that impalas have a higher chance of passing their genes on to the next generation compared to rhinos. Justifying the steps: 1. Define the problem: The problem here is to determine which species, rhinos or impalas, have a higher likelihood to pass on their genes to the next generation, based on the adaptation behaviors they have developed in response to human encroachment of their habitats. 2. Process the Information: According to the details, impalas have adapted certain behaviors that are beneficial to their survival and the survival of their young, while the behaviors rhinos have acquired have not been as successful in ensuring their survival. 3. Apply the hint: The hint implies that animals that have behaviors that increase the chance of survival and reproduction can pass these traits down to the next generation through the process of natural selection. It states that behaviors that increase an animal's fitness make the animal more likely to pass on their genes. 4. Extract conclusion: Given that impalas have developed behaviors that are successful in ensuring their survival and that of their offspring, while rhinos have not been as successful in this aspect, it can be concluded that the impalas have a higher fitness. Therefore, impalas have a better chance of passing on their genes to the next generation.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Meanwhile, Dana's colleague Dr. Janosz Poha has become increasingly obsessed with the glowering image of Vigo in the painting and falls under its spell. Vigo, whose spirit inhabits the painting, orders Janosz to locate a child that he can possess, allowing him to return to life on the New Year. Janosz, infatuated with Dana, offers to bring baby Oscar to Vigo in exchange for Dana, a deal which Vigo accepts. The Ghostbusters' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped. Lowered underneath, Ray discovers a vast river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line. Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample, Ray causes a city-wide blackout by accidentally kicking a cast... My question: What did the Ghostbusters save the New York city from?

Answer the following question: Addison put the dishes away after she cleaned up.  Given the context: How would Addison feel afterwards?  Possible answers: a clean person, sad, accomplished Answer:","output":"Given the context, it is most likely that Addison would feel accomplished after putting the dishes away and cleaning up. When a person completes a task, especially one related to maintaining a clean environment, it generally generates a sense of achievement and satisfaction. This feeling arises from the knowledge that they have performed a productive action which contributes to bringing order to their surroundings. For Addison, cleaning up and putting the dishes away indicates that she is someone who takes responsibility for her living space and takes pride in maintaining a tidy environment. By doing so, it allows her to have a sense of control over her surroundings and adds to her overall well-being. Although it is possible that a person might feel sad after completing such a task, it is less likely in this context. Feeling sad might occur if the task was associated with an unpleasant memory, or if it was done under duress or against their will. However, there is no indication in the context provided that Addison's actions were compelled by any external factors. Feeling like a clean person is also a valid answer, but it is not necessarily a feeling that would be experienced exclusively after completing the task. Rather, being a clean person is more of an overall characteristic or habit exhibited across numerous actions in daily life. While putting away dishes and cleaning up is one aspect of being a clean person, it does not solely define one's identity in that regard. In conclusion, given the context, it would be reasonable to infer that Addison feels accomplished after putting the dishes away and cleaning up. This sense of achievement is likely to stem from her recognition that she has completed a valuable task, contributing to the orderliness and cleanliness of her living environment."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process:  - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left.  suppose the wood will be more moist happens, how will it affect MORE/FASTER weathering occurring.

What are some examples Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: (A). no (B). yes","output":"A compound subject and a compound predicate are parts of a sentence structure that involve two or more subjects and predicates respectively. They are used to combine multiple subjects or predicates to form a more complex sentence. Each part serves a specific purpose within a sentence. A compound subject consists of two or more simple subjects joined together by a conjunction, such as \\"and\\" or \\"or.\\" These simple subjects share the same predicate and describe what the sentence is about. In a compound subject, each simple subject maintains its unique identity within the sentence, but contributes to a unified meaning. For example, in the sentence \\"Maria and John went to the store,\\" the compound subject is \\"Maria and John.\\" Both Maria and John (the simple subjects) are performing the action of going to the store. A compound predicate, on the other hand, occurs when two or more predicates describe actions or states of being related to the same subject in a sentence. These predicates are also joined by conjunctions, such as \\"and,\\" \\"or,\\" or \\"but.\\" A compound predicate allows for the expression of multiple actions or attributes related to the same subject. For example, in the sentence \\"The dog barked and wagged its tail,\\" the compound predicate is \\"barked and wagged its tail.\\" Both actions (barking and wagging) are attributed to the same subject, which is the dog. Now, regarding the two questions: 1. What is a compound subject and compound predicate? 2. What is a compound subject and compound predicate? What are some examples? Option (B) is the correct answer. Both questions indeed have the same meaning, as they inquire about the definitions of compound subjects and compound predicates. The only difference between the two questions is that the second one requests examples. This inclusion of examples does not alter the main focus of the question, which is the meaning of these grammatical concepts. Consequently, both questions, in essence, seek the same information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

What is the theory of evolution by natural selection and what are some examples? What is biological evolution by natural selection? What are some examples? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The theory of evolution by natural selection and biological evolution by natural selection refer to the same concept. Both questions essentially have the same meaning, and they are inquiring about the process through which species evolve and adapt over time due to natural selection pressures. The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century. This theory describes the process by which organisms change over successive generations because of differences in their inherited traits, allowing for specific adaptations to their environments. The main components of this process are variation, inheritance, selection, and adaptation. Step 1: Variation Individuals within a species possess variations in their traits. These variations can arise from genetic mutations, gene recombination during sexual reproduction, and other factors. Step 2: Inheritance Offspring inherit traits from their parents, which helps to pass on specific variations between generations. Step 3: Selection Organisms face environmental pressures, including competition for resources, predation, and changing environmental factors. Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This is known as \\"survival of the fittest.\\" Step 4: Adaptation Over many generations, the advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to adaptations that enhance the species' ability to survive in their specific environment. Examples of evolution by natural selection include: 1. Peppered moths: During the Industrial Revolution in England, dark-colored (melanic) peppered moths increased in numbers due to pollution darkening tree trunks. The dark moths were better camouflaged against their environment, reducing predation by birds. When environmental pollution decreased in the 20th century, lighter-colored moths regained prevalence as they were better camouflaged on now-lighter tree trunks. 2. Antibiotic resistance: Bacteria have been evolving to withstand antibiotics through natural selection. Some bacteria possess genetic mutations that grant resistance to specific antibiotics. In an environment with antibiotic use, resistant bacteria are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the antibiotic-resistant genes to future generations. This example demonstrates an evolutionary arms race between medical science and bacterial adaptation. 3. Darwin's finches: The finches on the Galapagos Islands are probably the most famous case of adaptive radiation. Different species of finches have adapted to specific niches and resources on each island, resulting in the evolution of diverse beak shapes and sizes that suit their specific diets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"In the TV show \\"Lost Girl,\\" the romantic fate of the protagonist Bo, played by Anna Silk, has been a subject of ongoing discussion throughout the series. If you're looking for a definite conclusion, \\"Lost Girl\\" Season 5 does assert an answer, but in typical \\"Lost Girl\\" fashion, it does so in a somewhat open-ended fashion. The fifth and final season of \\"Lost Girl\\" focuses heavily on the romantic relationship between Bo and Lauren, who is a human and a doctor. This season sees a significant development in their relationship. Bo and Lauren, played by Zoie Palmer, have had an on-again, off-again relationship throughout the series, much to the delight and despair of viewers who have been shipping them since the beginning. They have overcome various obstacles, including Lauren's initial affiliation with the Fae-obsessed organization known as the Light Fae, her financial troubles, her relationship with the duplicitous Evony, and Bo's own commitment issues and succubus nature, which pose significant challenges to their relationship. In Season 5, Bo and Lauren are faced with more threats and challenges. Notably, Hades – who reveals himself as Bo's father – is a significant antagonist whom they must confront together. Issues related to Lauren’s mortality also come to the fore, as she is a human in a relationship with an immortal Fae. Despite all these obstacles, they are able to confront their fears and vulnerabilities, which strengthened their relationship. By the end of the series, viewers see Bo and Lauren decide to stay together despite the dangers and challenges of their inter-species relationship. While the series finale hints that there are likely further adventures (and troubles) in store for them but doesn’t exactly wrap up their story in a neat bow. So, to answer your question, Bo ultimately ends up with Lauren by the end of \\"Lost Girl\\" Season 5. Their relationship proves to be an enduring aspect of the series, despite many trials and turbulences, suggesting a deep, abiding love between the two characters. The series finale definitively confirms the love and commitment between Bo and Lauren, ultimately satisfying fans who were rooting for them to end up together."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: If there is a pond with tall building around it, where is it unlikely to be?

First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. Overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because Lucy & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very, very sad. Anyway, what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not great casting at all. And the switch from Madeline Zima to Rachel York.... uhhh, like Lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said, this focused mainly just on Lucy & Desi. Had there been more time, had the story been more about Lucy's entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton very briefly instead. Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well, for the most part. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I Love Lucy but isn't an enormous Lucille Ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly mixed with a slight positive leaning. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's interesting look into Lucy and Desi's lives and some aspects they enjoyed, such as the presence of other famous figures in Lucy's life. However, they express concerns about certain casting choices and the abrupt change of actresses for Lucy's character. They also mention that the movie might not have been necessary, as the audience didn't need to know everything about the stars' lives. Despite these reservations, the reviewer still gives the film a grade of B, indicating a somewhat positive sentiment overall."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does \\"Patting the girl's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" appear to be an accurate statement based on \\"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Patting the girl's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" appears to be an accurate representation of the original statement \\"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" Both sentences convey the same meaning, which is that a woman is patting a girl's back while smiling at her. However, there is a subtle difference in focus between the two sentences. In the original sentence (\\"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"), the pronoun \\"her\\" refers to the girl's back, and it is already clear that the woman is interacting with the girl. The focus of the sentence is more on the actions themselves - patting and smiling. In the rephrased sentence (\\"Patting the girl's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"), the addition of \\"the girl's\\" explicitly specifies the girl as the recipient of the action, making the connection between the girl and her back more apparent. This slight shift in focus places more emphasis on 'the girl' as the recipient of both the patting and the smiling actions. Ultimately, both sentences are accurate and convey the same overall meaning. The choice between the two would depend on the intended emphasis and the context in which the sentence is being used. The original sentence might be preferable if the focus of the passage is on the actions depicted: patting and smiling. Alternatively, the rephrased sentence might be better suited if the emphasis is on the girl as a character or if the author wants to make her presence more explicit in the scene."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just about every time an article about \\"sugar\\" is published, I get frustrated because of the effort by some to falsely target sugar. Although reporters often ask the Sugar Association for scientific facts and data regarding sugar to use in their stories, the information we provide is rarely included. Often, it's completely ignored because it does not support the preconceived focus of their article. Thus, a tremendous amount of factual, scientifically verified information about all-natural sugar (sucrose) is being left out of today's conversation. And, sugar, the natural version, is too often confused with the more prevalent man-made sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. That's misleading for consumers. And it's bad for advancing a real debate about solving the serious problem of obesity in America. Opinion: The sweet secret that could kill you. I'm talking about a legitimate, credible discussion, supported by government data and independent scientific research, not hysteria and misinformation. Those using inflammatory and baseless phrases like \\"toxic\\" are often more concerned with a sound bite to sensationalize an article or TV appearance, and their claims have more to do with boosting their social media following or selling books than resolving genuine issues of public health. Targeting sugar alone is disingenuous, at best. The most recent example of this trend is a study that appeared in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, and the media storm that ensued, condemning sugar as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease. Consider this: The authors of the study itself concede that an observational study like theirs is not proof of cause and effect. The authors fail to note the weakness of the self-reported data they used to estimate intake levels of \\"added sugar.\\" This inadequacy is demonstrated by the fact that study participants self-reporting higher levels of physical activity had a greater, not the expected lower, risk of cardiovascular disease. And the study's authors also simplistically lumped together all caloric sweeteners as \\"added sugar\\" rather than identifying them individually (more on this in a minute). Yet that didn't stop headlines like \\"Sugar tied to fatal heart problems\\" or \\"Eating too much sugar may be killing you.\\" Sugar not only makes you fat, it may make you sick. These headlines -- and many others resulting from the study -- underscore the problem consumers are facing when seeking factual information on health. Having worked with the U.S. sugar industry for more than a decade, I am becoming more and more dismayed by those habitually providing a megaphone for what \\"some\\" folks are saying while barely giving a thought to whether these claims reflect a consensus view that is either prevailing among qualified experts or is scientifically correct. Although obsessing about sugar as \\"the\\" problem in our diets gives headline writers everywhere the chance to grab our attention with provocative puns, it undermines the worth of important work regarding other dietary and health concerns. It takes the focus and resources away from us supporting scientifically verified, proven interventions dealing with obesity. The fact is that American per capita consumption of real sugar (sucrose) is lower now than it was 40 years ago by approximately one-third (34%). So of all the things we need to worry about in this world, \\"higher\\" consumption of sugar is not among them. Because we've been consuming less of it for decades. And when critics talk about consumption of \\"sugar-sweetened\\" or \\"sugary beverages,\\" they are often inaccurately lumping sugar -- from sugar cane and sugar beets -- with man-made sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, for example, are different sweeteners. They are molecularly different. With U.S. Department of Agriculture data showing that more than 90% of the caloric sweetener used in beverages in the United States is such corn syrup, not sugar, how can the media, or anyone, continue to call them \\"sugar-sweetened beverages\\"? So Americans just need to remember: Only sucrose, or sugar, is sugar. Sugar has been consumed safely for centuries and, when consumed in moderation, has been and should continue to be part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. That's a fact. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Briscoe. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the actual bill that was the subject of the number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations held by rave and electronic dance music fans? from the following article ?  In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. Due to the lack of licensed, legal dance event venues, house music promoters began organising illegal events in unused warehouses, aeroplane hangars and in the countryside.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Most substances have three distinct phases: gas, liquid, and solid. Phase changes among the various phases of matter depend on temperature and pressure. The existence of the three phases with respect to pressure and temperature can be described in a phase diagram. Two phases coexist (i. , they are in thermal equilibrium) at a set of pressures and temperatures. These are described as a line on a phase diagram. The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram. A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor. Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone. Dalton’s law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all of the gases present.   Q: Temperature and pressure affect changes in phases or states of what?   A: The answer is:","output":"Temperature and pressure affect changes in phases or states of matter, particularly in substances undergoing transitions between their gas, liquid, and solid phases. These changes in phases, also known as phase transitions, include processes such as melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, sublimation, and deposition, which occur under specific conditions of temperature and pressure.  When a substance undergoes a phase transition, its physical properties, such as density, energy, and particle arrangement, are subject to alteration due to the influence of temperature and pressure. These factors cause changes in the intermolecular forces holding particles together, which in turn leads to the observed phase transitions. For instance, when a solid is heated, the increased energy and vibration of its particles may surpass the intermolecular forces at a certain temperature, causing the solid to melt into a liquid. Similarly, when a liquid is heated, it may reach its boiling point under certain pressure conditions, allowing the particles to break free of their liquid state and become a gas. Conversely, decreases in temperature or increases in pressure can lead to a gas condensing into a liquid or a liquid freezing into a solid, respectively. Phase diagrams represent the relationships between temperature, pressure, and the various phases of matter. They typically consist of three main regions, representing the solid, liquid, and gas phases, with curved boundary lines between these regions known as phase boundaries. These boundaries indicate the conditions under which two phases of a substance will coexist in thermal equilibrium, meaning that they are at the same temperature and pressure. At the intersection of all three phase boundaries, a unique condition called the triple point occurs, where a substance's three phases coexist simultaneously. To further understand how temperature and pressure influence phase changes, we can consider the concepts of vapor pressure and partial pressure. Vapor pressure refers to the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase, while partial pressure is the pressure a gas would exert if it existed alone within a system. According to Dalton's law, the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of its individual gas components. In summary, temperature and pressure are the main factors that affect changes in the phases or states of matter. By influencing a substance's intermolecular forces and energy distribution, these two factors dictate the substance's behavior during phase transitions, which are represented visually in phase diagrams. The understanding of these phase changes and their dependencies on temperature and pressure has significant implications in various fields, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and environmental science."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Explanation: Options (A) and (D) are incorrect because they both mention the boy or teen holding a contact lens or pulling a contact lens out of the eye. However, the prompt clearly states that the teen has already taken the contact lens out. Thus, these actions would not logically follow the preceding events. Option (B) is incorrect because it talks about a nose piercing. There is no information in the question's context about the teen having or interacting with a nose piercing, so this doesn't logically follow the stated events either.

Information:  - Organized crime is a category of transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals who intend to engage in illegal activity, most commonly for money and profit. Some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, are politically motivated. Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them, such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so-called \\"protection\\". Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered \\"organized\\". A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia, mob, or crime syndicate; the network, subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - The Five Families refers to the five major New York City organized crime families of the Italian American Mafia. The term was first used in 1931, when Salvatore Maranzano formally organized the previously warring factions into what are now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese crime families, each with demarcated territory, organizationally structured in a now-familiar hierarchy, and having them reporting up to the same overarching governing entity. Initially (in the summer of 1931), that governing entity was a \\"capo di tutti capi\\" (boss of all bosses), but that September the role was replaced by The Commission, which continues to govern American Mafia activities in the United States and Canada.  - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Carlo \\"Don Carlo\\" Gambino (August 24, 1902  October 15, 1976) was an Italian-born American gangster heavily involved in La Cosa Nostra. Translated as 'this thing of ours', \\"LCN\\" is otherwise known as the American Mafia. He is notable for being boss of the Gambino crime family, which is still named after him. After the 1957 Apalachin Convention he unexpectedly seized control of the Commission of the \\"American Mafia\\". Gambino was known for being low-key and secretive. In 1937 Gambino was convicted of tax evasion but had his sentence suspended. He lived to the age of 74, when he died of a heart attack in bed \\"in a state of grace,\\" according to a priest who had given him the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He had two brothers, Gaspare Gambino, who later married and was never involved with the Mafia and is not to be confused with another Gaspare Gambino who was a mafioso in Palermo, and Paolo Gambino who, on the other hand, had a big role in his brother's family.  - Anthony Megale ( August 1 , 1953 -- July 21 , 2015 ) , also known as \`\` The Genius '' , \`\` Tony Connecticut '' , \`\` Machiavelli '' , \`\` Mac '' , \`\` The Brain '' , \`\` Mr. T '' , and \`\` Gas Man '' was a Connecticut mobster who became the acting underboss of the Gambino crime family .  - The American Mafia, often referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, (commonly shortened to the Mafia or Mob) and also known as the Italian-American Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (LCN), or the American Cosa Nostra, is an influential, highly organized Italian-American criminal society. The organization is often referred to by members as Cosa Nostra (\\"our thing\\"). It originated and developed from the original \\"Mafia\\" or \\"Cosa nostra\\", the Sicilian Mafia, though eventually encompassing other non-Sicilian Italian-American gangsters and organized crime groups of Italian origin in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The father of American organized crime is generally considered to be Sicilian-American criminal Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano.  - The Gambino crime family (pronounced ) is one of the \\"Five Families\\" that dominates organized crime activities in New York City, United States, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the Mafia (or \\"Cosa Nostra\\"). The group, which went through three bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, fraud, hijacking, pier thefts, and fencing.  - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.  - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\".  - Underboss (also capo bastone or sotto capo) is a position within the leadership structure of Sicilian and American Mafia crime families. The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned.  - Extortion (also called shakedown, outwrestling, and exaction) is a criminal offense of obtaining money, property, or services from an institution, through coercion. It is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a \\"protection racket\\" since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for \\"protection\\" from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant.  - The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States. Flowing roughly southward for through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province   via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. Discharging at per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water.    What is the relationship between 'anthony megale' and 'gangster'?
