If the first dice shows a 5, the second dice can also show any number from 1 to 6 to get a sum greater than 2. That's another 6 possible outcomes.

This is because if we subtract the second equation from the first, the f(x) terms cancel out, leaving us with g(x) - g(x-2) = 0, which implies g(x) = g(x-2). Since g(x) is an odd function, we have g(x) = -g(-x). Setting x = 1, we get g(1) = -g(-1). But since g(x) = g(x-2), we also have g(1) = g(-1). Combining these, we get g(1) = -g(-1) = g(-1), which implies g(1) = 0. Therefore, option A is correct, and we have g(1) = 0. **For option B:** From f(x) + g(x) = 2, setting x = 0 gives us f(0) + g(0) = 2. Since g(x) is an odd function, we know g(0) = 0. Thus, f(0) = 2. This means option B is incorrect because it suggests f(0) = 0, but we found f(0) = 2. **For option C:** Given f(x) + g(x-2) = 2, we can rewrite this as f(x+2) + g(x) = 2 by shifting the index.

To find (cos A), we use the law of cosines:    [    cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}    ]    Substituting (a), (b), and (c):    [    cos A = frac{left( frac{5k}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{3k}{2} right)^2 - left( frac{7k}{2} right)^2}{2 cdot frac{5k}{2} cdot frac{3k}{2}} = frac{left( frac{25k^2}{4} right) + left( frac{9k^2}{4} right) - left( frac{49k^2}{4} right)}{frac{30k^2}{4}} = frac{frac{25k^2 + 9k^2 - 49k^2}{4}}{frac{30k^2}{4}} = frac{frac{-15k^2}{4}}{frac{30k^2}{4}} = frac{-15}{30} = -frac{1}{2}    ]    Since (cos A = -frac{1}{2}), we know that (A = 120^circ). 5.

This gives us a total of 4 outcomes. - Event A (both heads appear) corresponds to the outcome HH. - Event B (both tails appear) corresponds to the outcome TT. - The combination A+B represents either both heads or both tails appearing, which covers the outcomes HH and TT. - Since there are also outcomes HT and TH that do not fall under A+B, A+B does not cover all possible outcomes. Hence, A+B is not a certain event. 2. **Option B: AB is an impossible event.** - For AB to occur, both events A and B would have to happen simultaneously. This means both coins would have to show heads and tails at the same time, which is impossible. - Therefore, AB is indeed an impossible event. 3. **Option C: Events A and B are mutually exclusive.** - Events A and B being mutually exclusive means that if event A occurs, event B cannot occur, and vice versa. - Since event A corresponds to both coins showing heads and event B corresponds to both coins showing tails, it's clear that they cannot occur at the same time. - Therefore, events A and B are mutually exclusive. 4. **Option D: Events A and B are independent events.** - For events to be independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other. - However, in this case, if A occurs (both coins show heads), B cannot occur (both coins show tails), and vice versa. This shows that the occurrence of one does affect the possibility of the other occurring. - Hence, events A and B are not independent events.

The two planes could intersect along a line different from a or be distinct parallel planes. 4. If a perp alpha and a perp beta, suppose there exists point P on line a. Since a perp alpha, the line through P parallel to any direction in alpha must lie entirely in beta, because such a line is also perpendicular to a.

Sasha wrote a non-zero digit on the board and continues to append a non-zero digit to the right of the last number until there are exactly 1 million digits. Prove that no more than 100 perfect squares were written on the board. 1. Consider the sequences of perfect squares that occur on the board. We can distinguish between numbers with an odd and even number of digits. 2. Let ( x_1^2, x_2^2, ldots ) be the perfect squares with an even number of digits, where ( x_k^2 ) contains ( 2n_k ) digits ((n_1 < n_2 < cdots)). 3. Similarly, let ( y_1^2, y_2^2, ldots ) be the perfect squares with an odd number of digits, where ( y_k^2 ) contains ( 2m_k - 1 ) digits ((m_1 < m_2 < cdots)). 4. A number ( x_k^2 ) has ( 2n_k ) digits and does not end in 0. Therefore, we have:    [    x_k^2 > 10^{2n_k-1} implies x_k > 10^{n_k-1}    ] 5. The number ( x_{k+1}^2 ) is formed by appending an even number of non-zero digits (denoted as ( 2a )) to ( x_k ). Therefore, we can write:    [    10^{2a} x_k^2 < x_{k+1}^2 < 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 10^{2a}    ] 6. From the left inequality, we get:    [    10^{a} x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1} implies 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 2 cdot 10^a x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1}^2    ] 7. Combining the inequalities, we have:    [    10^{2a} x_k^2 + 2 cdot 10^a x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1}^2 < 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 10^{2a}    ] 8. This implies:    [    2 cdot 10^a x_k + 1 < 10^{2a} implies x_k < 10^a    ] 9. Thus, ( x_k ) has at most ( a ) digits, meaning ( n_k leq a ). Following from this, we also have:    [    10^a x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1} implies a + n_k leq n_{k+1}    ] 10. Therefore:     [     2n_k leq n_{k+1}     ] 11. Similar arguments apply to the sequences ( y_k^2 ), where ( y_{k+1}^2 ) is formed by appending digits to ( y_k^2 ). This leads to:     [     y_{k+1}^2 leq 2 y_k     ] 12. This implies ( y_k < 10^a ) and ( a geq m_k ), so:     [     m_{k+1} geq 2 m_k     ] 13.

A player can take the same number of objects from both piles (the amount must be the same, but at least 1). The player who takes the last object wins.","output":"To solve the problem effectively, we need to follow the steps for understanding and proving the solution to the Wythoff game. Let's go step-by-step as follows.  Step 1: Understand the Game Rules In the Wythoff game, there are two heaps of objects with an arbitrary number of objects. The players take turns removing objects according to these rules: 1. A player can remove any number of objects, say ( t ), from one pile (where ( t geq 1 )). 2. A player can remove the same number of objects from both piles at once (where ( t geq 1 )). The player forced to take the last object loses.  Step 2: Define the States We denote a state in the game by an ordered pair ((k, l)), where (k) and (l) are the number of objects in each heap. According to the rules: - From ((k, l)), one can move to ((k-t, l)), ((k, l-t)), or ((k-t, l-t)) for any ( t geq 1 ).  Step 3: Formulate Wythoff Sequence To discern the winning and losing positions, we use two sequences: - The sequence of positions ((a_n, b_n)) where ( a_n = leftlfloor alpha n rightrfloor ) and ( b_n = leftlfloor beta n rightrfloor ). - Here (alpha = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}) (the golden ratio), and (beta = alpha + 1).  Step 4: Calculate Specific Positions We calculate positions using ( alpha ) and ( beta ): - For ( n = 100 ):   [   a_{100} = leftlfloor 100 times frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 times 1.61803398 cdots rightrfloor = 161   ]   [   b_{100} = leftlfloor 100 times left(frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} + 1right) rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 times 2.61803398 cdots rightrfloor = 261   ]  Step 5: Characteristics of Winning and Losing Positions From the sequences, the following characteristics are observed: 1. (a_0 = b_0 = 0). 2. (a_n) is the smallest natural number that hasn't appeared in any previous position. 3. (b_n = a_n + n). To prove: [ b_n - a_n = [n beta] - [n alpha] = leftlfloor n(1+alpha) rightrfloor - [n alpha] = [n+n alpha] - [n alpha] = n + [n alpha] - [n alpha] = n ]  Step 6: Transforming Between Positions We derive transformations to show how configurations shift based on moves: - Any move from a (textit{winning}) position ((a_n, b_n)) must result in a (textit{losing}) position. - Conversely, any move from a (textit{losing}) position can convert it into a (textit{winning}) position. By the construction of the Wythoff sequences, every natural number ( k ) appears exactly once within the pairs ((a_n, b_n)).  Step 7: Theorems and Proofs # Theorem 1: In the Wythoff game, any move from a losing position ((a_n, b_n)) will convert it into a winning position. - Suppose ((a_n, b_n)), the operation results in ((a_n - t, b_n)), then (b_n) appears twice in winning positions which isn't possible. - Similarly, for operations resulting in ((a_n, b_n - t)) and ((a_n - t, b_n - t)). # Theorem 2: For any given non-winning position ((m, m)). - ( t = m), and ((m - t, m - t) = (0, 0)) transitions it to a winning position. Conclusively, applying this logic iteratively: - If the initial position is non-winning, the first player wins. - If the initial position is winning, the second player wins. # Conclusion The Wythoff game's result is determined by whether the initial position is a winning or losing configuration.

Therefore, the distance rho(A, B) between two cells A and B with Cartesian coordinates (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively, is given by:    [    rho(A, B) = max{|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2|}    ]    This formula captures the number of king's moves required to reach from one cell to another. 2. **Setting the Coordinates**: Let the marked cells be A, B, and C. Given that the distance between these pairs (i.e., rho(A, B), rho(B, C), and rho(A, C)) is 100, it implies that the maximum of the absolute differences in their coordinates is 100. 3. **Fixed Axis**:    Given that the distance between B and C is 100:    [    max{|x_B - x_C|, |y_B - y_C|} = 100    ] 4. **Assumptions and Constraints**:    To simplify, assume without loss of generality that the cells’ x-coordinates differ. For instance, assume A and B differ along the x-axis by 100 units. Similarly, assume A and C also differ along the x-axis by 100 units:    [    |x_A - x_B| = 100, quad |x_A - x_C| = 100    ]    Hence, B and C must then differ along the y-axis, or else x_A would be equal in all three, contradicting 100 separation. Consequently, assume:    [    |y_B - y_C| = 100,  text{ with } x_B = x_C    ]    Summarizing, let:    [    B(0, 0), C(0, 100), A(100, y)    ] 5. **Finding Cell 50 moves from all marked cells**:    Let X(x, y) be a cell such that its distance to A, B, and C is 50. Thus:    [    rho(X, B) = 50 quad Rightarrow quad max{|x - 0|, |y - 0|} = 50    ]    [    rho(X, C) = 50 quad Rightarrow quad max{|x - 0|, |y -100|} = 50    ]    [    rho(X, A) = 50 quad Rightarrow quad max{|x - 100|, |y - hat{y}|} = 50    ]     6. **Solving**:    For X to satisfy rho(X, B) = 50 and rho(X, C) = 50, correspondingly:    [    x = 50 text{, } y text{ must be } 50 & 50 text{ respectively.}    ]    Hence x = 50 and y = 50. 7. **Conclusion**:     Therefore, there is only one such cell at coordinates (50, 50) that is 50 moves away from each of the marked cells.

Each subsequent move is made perpendicular to the previous one: if the previous move was horizontal  left or right, then the next one will be vertical  up or down, and vice versa. What is the maximum number of turtles that can move indefinitely on the board such that at each moment no cell contains more than one turtle?","output":"# Problem: In some cells of a rectangular board of size (101 times 99) each cell contains one turtle. Every minute, each turtle simultaneously crawls to one of the neighboring cells of the board in such a way that if the previous move was horizontal (left or right), the next move will be vertical (up or down), and vice versa. What is the maximum number of turtles that can move indefinitely on the board such that at any moment no more than one turtle is in any cell?  The answer: 9800. Let's show how we can have examples of 9800 turtles moving indefinitely on the board:  Example 1: 1. We place turtles in cells located at the intersection of the bottom 98 horizontal rows and the leftmost 100 vertical columns of the board. 2. The turtles will move as follows: first, all move to the right, then all move up, then all move to the left, and finally, all move down. After 4 moves, the situation matches the initial one, so the movement can be repeated indefinitely, allowing for unbounded movement in the specified manner.  Example 2: 1. Start with the same initial placement of turtles as in Example 1. 2. Organize the movement by breaking them into smaller (2 times 2) grids. In each (2 times 2) grid, turtles will all move clockwise: first right, then down, then left, and then up. This results in a cycle where after 4 moves, each turtle will return to its starting position, allowing for indefinite repetition.  Proving that more than 9800 turtles cannot be placed: Let's assume the contrary, that turtles are positioned on the board such that more than 9800 can move indefinitely without ending up in a situation where two turtles occupy the same cell. 1. **Color the cells of the board in a checkerboard pattern**: Assume the bottom left cell is black. This gives us 5000 black cells and 4999 white cells.     - Name a cell **black odd** if both its row and column numbers are odd, and **black even** if both are even.     - For **white cells**, one coordinate is even and the other is odd. 2. **Distribution of black cells**: There will be (51 times 50 = 2550) odd black cells and (50 times 49 = 2450) even black cells. 3. **Movement impact**: When a turtle moves, it changes the parity of both its coordinates. Thus:     - After two moves, turtles on odd black cells move to even black cells and vice versa.     - Turtles on white cells return to white cells. 4. **Invariant property**: In any given situation, the count of turtles on even black cells and on odd black cells cannot exceed 2450 and 2550 respectively. 5. **Bounding the number of turtles**: Consequently, the total number of turtles on black cells is always less than or equal to (2 cdot 2450 = 4900). 6. **Final bound**: After each move, turtles on white cells switch to black cells and vice versa. Thus, the number of turtles on the board is bounded by (2 cdot 4900 = 9800). Hence, placing more than 9800 turtles on the board such that they can move indefinitely without collisions is impossible.  Therefore, the proof concludes that the maximum number of turtles that can be properly placed and move indefinitely on the board is: ( boxed{9800} )"},{"instruction":"the nodes of the grid of a checkered rectangle, there are 4 light bulbs placed, all of which are initially turned off.

Each move must turn on at least one bulb. Is it possible to turn on all the bulbs in exactly four moves?","output":"1. First, we need to visualize and understand the positions of the lamps in the rectangular grid and mark the initial configuration where all lamps are turned off. 2. Let's consider a rectangular grid with 4 lamps located at the vertices of the grid. Without loss of generality, assume the lamps are positioned at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). 3. We will begin by drawing an auxiliary line through two lamps situated at diagonally opposite corners. In our case, we can draw a line passing through (0,0) and (1,1). This line cuts the rectangle into two parts. 4. Since no lamps are situated exactly on this line, the auxiliary line does not intersect any other lamps except the two it passes through. Hence, by turning on all lamps below (or above) this line, we can ensure that any lamps below (or above) it will be lit.     Similarly, another set of two lamps situated at the top or bottom of this line will be considered. Here, either (0,0), (1,0) or (0,1), (1,1). 5. Next, we construct the first vertical line parallel to the auxiliary line. Place it slightly below one of the previously mentioned diagonal lamps (but above the other lamp if we're moving from top to bottom). This ensures all lamps below this line get turned on, leaving us with already lit (0,0), (1,0) and (1,0) being turned to (0,0), (0,1).       Similarly, whenever requisite of lines being lit, vertical lines continue parallelly to auxiliary lines leaving minimal points being dark. 6. Finally, conduct another parallel line slightly higher to enlighten remaining dark lamps. We approach setting lines such that all sides in accordance of room are now enlightened sequentially using moves. 7. Reiterate this approach, illuminating each quadrant of regions being divided by auxiliary line, ensuring no lamp remains unlit.    Conduct figures and calculations each move verifying the remaining dark spots. **Conclusion**: By following through horizontal or vertical lines configurations step-by-step and switching them on, a total of 4 moves lights all lamps coherently.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:        [    2.9 < 100 cdot frac{y}{x} < 3.1    ] 3. To work with this inequality more conveniently, convert the percentages to fractions and rewrite the inequality. This gives us:    [    0.029 < frac{y}{x} < 0.031    ]        Multiplying the entire inequality by 100 to clear the fractions, we get:    [    2.9 < 100 cdot frac{y}{x} < 3.1    ] 4. Next, multiply the entire inequality by x to get rid of the denominator:    [    2.9x < 100y < 3.1x    ] 5. To make further calculations easier, let's multiply every term by 10 to eliminate the decimals:    [    29x < 1000y < 31x    ] 6. We need to find the smallest possible integer value of x that satisfies this inequality. Start by testing with small values incrementally.

Calculate the inequalities for x = 33:        When x = 33:    [    29 cdot 33 < 1000y < 31 cdot 33    ] 8. Compute the values on both sides:    [    957 < 1000y < 1023    ]        Divide by 1000:    [    0.957 < y < 1.023    ]    Since y must be an integer, the only possible value for y in this range is 1. Hence, y = 1. 9.

In this case, the population is the 2000 students in the school since the interest in diving among all these students is being considered.    - A **sample** is a subset of the population selected for the actual study. Here, the 150 students randomly selected for statistical analysis constitute the sample. 2. **Analyzing Each Option**:    - **Option A**: States that the 2000 students are the population. This statement is **correct** because the population, in this context, refers to all 2000 students whose interest in diving is under consideration.    - **Option B**: Indicates that the 150 selected students are a sample of the population. This is **correct** as these students represent a smaller group selected from the total population for analysis.    - **Option C**: Mentions that the sample size is 150. This is **correct** because the sample size refers to the number of individuals or observations in the sample, which is indeed 150 in this scenario.    - **Option D**: Describes the survey as a sampling survey.

To this end, we need to show that [ left|(5 + sqrt{26})^n - leftlfloor (5 + sqrt{26})^n rightrfloor right| < 10^{-n}. ]  Step-by-step Solution: 1. We start by defining the integer part of the expression: [ text{Let } lfloor x rfloor text{ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to } x. ] 2. We can express the given problem equivalently as needing to show: [ left|(5 + sqrt{26})^n - lfloor (5 + sqrt{26})^n rfloor right| < 10^{-n}. ] 3. Next, observe the expression: [ (5 + sqrt{26})^n + (5 - sqrt{26})^n. ] 4. This can be expanded using the binomial theorem: [ (5 + sqrt{26})^n + (5 - sqrt{26})^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} 5^{n-k} left( sqrt{26} right)^k + sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} 5^{n-k} left( -sqrt{26} right)^k. ] 5.

Hence, only the terms with even powers of ( sqrt{26} ) will survive, making ( (5 + sqrt{26})^n + (5 - sqrt{26})^n ) an integer. Denote this integer by ( I_n ). 7. Recognize that ( left| 5 - sqrt{26} right| < frac{1}{10} ): [ 5^2 = 25 quad text{and} quad 5.1^2 = 26.01 implies 5 < sqrt{26} < 5.1. ] Thus,  [ left| 5 - sqrt{26} right| < 0.1 = frac{1}{10}. ] 8.

To estimate the sum, note that for large (k), (sqrt[1987]{k}) is close to 1 because the 1987th root of (k) grows very slowly. Therefore, we can approximate:    [    frac{1}{(k+1) sqrt[1987]{k}} approx frac{1}{k+1}    ] 5. The sum then approximates:    [    sum_{k=1}^{1987} frac{1}{k+1}    ] 6.

According to the information given, the third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one, so the third guinea pig eats x + 3 cups.

So, John covered a total distance of: 14 meters + 2 meters = 16 meters John covered this 16-meter distance in 32 seconds at a speed of 4.2 m/s. We can double-check this by calculating the distance using John's speed and the time of his final push: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 4.2 m/s × 32 s Distance = 134.4 meters This is the distance John covered during his final push, but we only need to consider the 16 meters that relate to the gap between him and Steve. Now, we need to find out how far Steve walked during those 32 seconds. Since John finished 2 meters ahead of Steve, Steve covered 16 meters - 2 meters = 14 meters during the 32 seconds.

[    {5 choose 3} = frac{5 times 4 times 3}{3 times 2 times 1} = 10    ]    Therefore, the number of ways to choose the rows and columns is:        [    {5 choose 3} times {5 choose 3} = 10 times 10 = 100    ] 2. **Assigning Blocks to Chosen Rows and Columns:**    After choosing 3 rows and 3 columns, we need to assign blocks to these positions. We can think of this as assigning each of the chosen columns to one of the chosen rows. For the first column, there are 3 possible rows to choose from. After assigning a row to the first column, there are 2 remaining rows for the second column, and the last row automatically goes to the third column.    This gives us 3! (3 factorial) ways to assign columns to rows:        [    3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6    ] 3. **Calculating the Total Number of Combinations:**    The total number of ways to select 3 blocks such that no two are in the same row or column is the product of the number of ways to choose the rows and columns and the number of ways to assign columns to rows:    [    {5 choose 3} times {5 choose 3} times 3! = 100 times 6 = 600    ]    Thus, the total number of different combinations of 3 blocks is boxed{mathrm{(C)  } 600}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"We say that a rational number is *spheric* if it is the sum of three squares of rational numbers (not necessarily distinct).

Since the train's length is given in meters, we'll convert the speeds to meters per second (m/s). The speed of the train is 56 km/hr. To convert this to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 56 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 56 * 1000 / 3600 = 56000 / 3600 ≈ 15.56 m/s The speed of the man is 2 km/hr. To convert this to m/s: 2 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 2 * 1000 / 3600 = 2000 / 3600 ≈ 0.56 m/s Since the man is walking in the direction of the train, we need to subtract his speed from the speed of the train to get the relative speed at which the train will cross the man. Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of man Relative speed = 15.56 m/s - 0.56 m/s = 15 m/s Now, we need to calculate the time it will take for the train to cross the man. The time taken to cross is the length of the train divided by the relative speed.

Now, we need to find out how this volume of displaced water will affect the height of the water in the fish tank. To do this, we use the volume of the displaced water and the base area of the fish tank to calculate the increase in water height. The base area (A_base) of the fish tank is: A_base = width * length A_base = 50 cm * 16 cm A_base = 800 square centimeters (cm²) The increase in water height (h_increase) due to the displaced water is: h_increase = V_cube / A_base h_increase = 1000 cm³ / 800 cm² h_increase = 1.25 cm Now, we add this increase to the original height of the water to find the new height of the water in the fish tank. The original height of the water (h_original) is 15 cm. So, the new height of the water (h_new) is: h_new = h_original + h_increase h_new = 15 cm + 1.25 cm h_new = 16.25 cm Therefore, the height of the water in the fish tank after submerging the cube-shaped object is boxed{16.25}  centimeters."},{"instruction":"A bakery sells three kinds of rolls.

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at (1, f(1)) is:  y - f(1) = f'(1)(x - 1),  which simplifies to:  y - (-14) = -15(x - 1),  The final equation of the tangent line is:  boxed{y = -15x + 29}.

Let ( log_{12}2 = b ). Thus: [ 12^b = 2 ] Since ( 12 = 2^2 cdot 3 ), we can write: [ (2^2 cdot 3)^b = 2 ] [ 2^{2b} cdot 3^b = 2 ] To isolate ( 2b ), knowing that ( 3^b ) can reasonably be estimated (approximation for simplicity, as exact logarithmic solutions would require more complex methods or numerical methods), let's assume ( b ) is small: [ 2b approx 1 text{ (from the primary term)} ] [ b approx frac{1}{2} ] Now, we compute: [ frac{1}{log_{12}2} = frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = boxed{2} ]"},{"instruction":"John buys 1.5 ounces of silver and twice as much gold. The silver costs a certain amount per ounce. The gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce. He spends 3030 on everything.

The gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce than the silver, so the cost of gold per ounce is 50S dollars. John buys twice as much gold as silver, which is 2 * 1.5 ounces = 3 ounces of gold. Therefore, the total cost for the gold is 3 * 50S = 150S dollars. The total amount spent on both silver and gold is 3030, so we can write the equation: 1.5S (cost of silver) + 150S (cost of gold) = 3030 Combining like terms, we get: 1.5S + 150S = 3030 151.5S = 3030 Now, we can solve for S by dividing both sides of the equation by 151.5: S = 3030 / 151.5 S = 20 Therefore, the cost of silver per ounce is boxed{20} ."},{"instruction":"Let the complex number z= frac {2i}{1+i}.

Step-by-Step Explanation: 1. **Identifying odd and even numbers in row 1:**    - Odd numbers: (1, 3, 5, 7)    - Even numbers: (2, 4, 6, 8) 2. **Setting conditions for row 2:**    - To ensure each sum is even, the entries in row 2 must match the parity of the entries directly above them in row 1.    - Therefore:      - Positions corresponding to odd numbers in row 1 (positions 1, 3, 5, 7): these must hold odd numbers.      - Positions corresponding to even numbers in row 1 (positions 2, 4, 6, 8): these must hold even numbers. 3. **Arranging odd numbers:**    - We have 4 positions (1, 3, 5, 7) that need to be filled with 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7).    - The number of ways to arrange 4 distinct odd numbers in these 4 positions is given by the factorial (4!):      [      4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24      ] 4. **Arranging even numbers:**    - We have 4 positions (2, 4, 6, 8) that need to be filled with 4 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8).    - The number of ways to arrange 4 distinct even numbers in these positions is also given by the factorial (4!):      [      4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24      ] 5. **Calculating the total number of arrangements:**    - Since the arrangement of odd numbers and even numbers are independent of each other, the total number of different ways Margot can complete row 2 is the product of the number of ways to arrange the odd and even numbers:      [      text{Total ways} = 24 times 24 = 576      ] # Conclusion: Margot can complete row 2 in ( boxed{576} ) different ways to ensure every entry in row 3 is even."},{"instruction":"Convert cos3a + cos5a into a product form.

For x > 0, we can see that: g'(x) > e^{x} - frac {1}{4} > 1 - frac {1}{4} = frac {3}{4} > 0, which tells us g(x) is strictly increasing on the interval (0, +infty).

Since g(0) = 0 and g(x) is strictly increasing on (0, +infty), there exists a unique x_0 in (0, +infty) such that F'(x_0) = 0. For x in (0, x_0), F'(x) > 0, and for x in (x_0, +infty), F'(x) < 0. Hence, F(x) is increasing on (0, x_0) and decreasing on (x_0, +infty), with a maximum at: F_{text{max}}(x) = F(x_0) = ln x_0 - af(x_0) + 1, where a = frac{1}{g(x_0)}. As x to 0^+, F(x) approaches negative infinity. The condition for F(x) having no zeroes is equivalent to F(x_0) < 0, so we define: G(x) = ln x - frac{f(x)}{g(x)} + 1. The derivative of G(x) is positive for x > 0 since f(x) > 0 and g(x) is increasing: G'(x) = frac{f(x)g'(x)}{g^2(x)} > 0. Thus, G(x) is increasing on (0, +infty) and G(1) = 0, which implies 0 < x_0 < 1.

Therefore, option A is incorrect. **For option B:** Considering the derived function f(x)=x+1+sqrt{x}, for this function to be meaningful (i.e., for sqrt{x} to be real), x must be greater than or equal to 0.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get two solutions:    [    x - 120 = pm 20    ] 4. Therefore, x_1 = 100 and x_2 = 140. Since we want to sell quickly and both prices are within the acceptable range, we choose the higher price to meet the quick sale requirement, which is x_2 = 140 dollars. However, the correct interpretation to meet the original profit goal and sell quickly would be to choose the lower price, x_1 = 100 dollars, to encourage faster sales. Thus, the selling price should be set at boxed{100 text{dollars}} to achieve a daily profit of 2400 and also sell quickly."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=cos(omega x+varphi) where (omega gt 0,0 lt varphi lt pi) has a minimum positive period of T.

If f(T)=frac{1}{2} and x=frac{{7π}}{3} is a critical point of the function f(x), we are asked to find the minimum value of omega. First, we know that the period T of the function f(x) is given by T=frac{2π}{ω}. Given that f(T)=frac{1}{2}, we can substitute T into the function: [ fleft(frac{2π}{ω}right) = cos left(frac{2π}{ω}cdot omega +varphi right) = cos left(2π +varphi right) = cos varphi = frac{1}{2} ] From cos varphi = frac{1}{2}, we deduce that varphi =frac{π}{3}, since 0 lt varphi lt pi and cos frac{π}{3} = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the function f(x) can be rewritten as fleft(xright)=cos (omega x+frac{π}{3}). Given that x=frac{{7π}}{3} is a critical point of f(x), we know that the derivative of f(x) with respect to x must be zero at x=frac{7π}{3}.

This occurs when k=1, because for k=1, omega =frac{3(1)-1}{7} = frac{2}{7}, which is the smallest positive value omega can take.

So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 105: Sum = (35/105) + (70/105) + (21/105) + (42/105) + (63/105) + (84/105) + (15/105) + (30/105) + (45/105) + (60/105) + (75/105) + (90/105) Now, we add the numerators: Sum = (35 + 70 + 21 + 42 + 63 + 84 + 15 + 30 + 45 + 60 + 75 + 90) / 105 Sum = (35 + 70 + 21 + 42 + 63 + 84 + 15 + 30 + 45 + 60 + 75 + 90) / 105 Sum = (525) / 105 Sum = 5 So, Kim removes pieces that sum up to boxed{5}  meters in length, which is the entire length of the branch.

These points are:       1. The midpoints of each side of the triangle.      2. The feet of the altitudes from each vertex to the opposite side.      3. The midpoints of the segments joining the orthocenter H to each vertex.     3. **Properties to Use:**    - These nine points lie on a circle whose center is the midpoint of the segment joining the circumcenter O and the orthocenter H.    - The radius of the Nine-Point Circle is half the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 4. **Proof:**    - Consider the triangle ABC with circumcircle centered at O and orthocenter at H.     - Let B_1 be the midpoint of side AC.    - By the properties of the Nine-Point Circle, the point B_1 (midpoint of a side) should lie on this circle. 5. **Using Midpoint Properties:**    - Denote O' as the midpoint of OH.    - Note that O lies on the circumcircle centered at O. Hence, OB = R, where R is the circumradius.    - In triangle BOH, the line O'B_3 is the midline, where B_3 is the midpoint of segment BH. Therefore:            O'B_3 = frac{1}{2} cdot OB = frac{1}{2} cdot R.       6. **Parallelogram Consideration:**    - Because OB_1 is parallel to HB_3 and both are equal (since B_1 is the midpoint), quadrilateral OB_3HB_1 is a parallelogram.    - Since O' is the midpoint of diagonal OH, triangle O'B_1, O'B_3 are equal, leading to:            O'B_1 = O'B_3 = frac{R}{2}.       7. **Midpoint and Isosceles Properties:**    - Construct a perpendicular from O' to AC at point K, parallel to B_1K = B_2K where B_2 is the foot of the altitude from B.    - Thus, O'B_1 = O'B_2 and:            O'B_1 = O'B_2 = O'B_3 = frac{R}{2}.       8. **Conclusion:**    - Hence, all three midpoints B_1, B_2, B_3 lie on a circle centered at O' with radius frac{R}{2}.    - By similar arguments, any three other points determined (out of the nine) using the definition of the Nine-Point Circle will lie on the same circle. Therefore, we have shown that:  O'B_1 = O'B_2 = O'B_3 = frac{R}{2}  All points lie on the Nine-Point Circle. # boxed{}"},{"instruction":"A man loves to go hiking.

Since he packs .5 pounds of supplies for every mile, we can divide the weight of his pack by the weight per mile to find the number of miles he can hike: 40 pounds / .5 pounds per mile = 80 miles Now, let's calculate the size of his resupply. The resupply is 25% as large as his first pack, so: 25% of 40 pounds = 0.25 * 40 = 10 pounds This resupply will allow him to hike additional miles. Again, we divide the weight of the resupply by the weight per mile: 10 pounds / .5 pounds per mile = 20 miles Adding the miles he can hike with his initial pack and the resupply gives us the total miles he can hike: 80 miles + 20 miles = 100 miles Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take him to hike 100 miles at a rate of 2.5 mph.

This is because the angle subtended by the same arc (AB_1) at (A) and (B_1) are equal:    [    angle B_1AA_1 = angle A_1BB_1    ]    Since these opposite angles are equal, the quadrilateral (AB A_1B_1) is cyclic by the Inscribed Angle Theorem. 3. **Parallel Chords Property**:    In such a cyclic quadrilateral, the parallel lines ( AB ) and ( A_1B_1 ) imply that the intercepted arcs subtend equal chords:    [    AB_1 = BA_1    ] 4. **Equal Segments in the Cyclic Quadrilateral**:    Using the properties of cyclic quadrilateral and the symmetric positions of the points concerning vertex ( C ), we can conclude that the segments ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_1 ) divide the triangle symmetrically around line ( AB ).  5. **Combining the Information**:    Thus, even without further explicit computational geometry, we deduce from the symmetry given by (angle CAA_1 = angle CBB_1) that (C) must be equidistant from (A) and (B). 6. **Conclusion**:     Therefore,     [    AC = BC    ] [ boxed{AC = BC} ]"},{"instruction":"A palindrome, such as 83438, is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

If no three people among these 21 people have all exchanged calls with each other, determine the maximum value of n.","output":"# Problem: 某天晚上, 21 个人之间互通电话 n 次, 已知其中有 m 个人 a_1, a_2, cdots, a_m 使 a_i 与 a_{i+1} 互通了电话 (i = 1, 2, cdots, m, a_{m+1} = a_1), 并且 m 为奇数. 如果在这 21 个人中没有 3 个人互通了电话, 求 n 的最大值. 1. Let's use 21 vertices to represent the 21 people. If two people have a phone call, we draw an edge between the corresponding vertices. If not, no edge is drawn. Thus, we obtain a graph G. 2. We are given that G contains an odd cycle and G does not contain any triangles. 3. To find the maximum number of edges n in G, let the length of the shortest odd cycle in G be 2k+1. Since G does not contain any triangles, k geq 2.      4. Let the cycle be labeled as A_1A_2 cdots A_{2k+1}A_1. For any i, j (1 leq i, j leq 2k+1), A_i and A_j do not have an edge if j neq i pm 1 to prevent the existence of a shorter odd cycle, contradicting our assumption on the cycle length. 5. Excluding A_1, A_2, cdots, A_{2k+1}, the remaining 21 - (2k+1) = 2(10 - k) vertices form a subgraph that should not contain any triangles.  6. According to Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free subgraph with 2(10 - k) vertices is frac{1}{4}(20 - 2k)^2 = (10 - k)^2. 7. Each of these 2(10 - k) vertices can connect to at most k vertices of the cycle (since connecting to adjacent vertices would form a triangle). Hence, they can form at most 2(10 - k) cdot k edges with the vertices of the cycle. 8. Therefore, for the total number of edges n, we have:    [    n leqslant 2k+1 + (10 - k)^2 + 2(10 - k) cdot k    ] 9. Simplifying, we get:    [    n = 2k + 1 + (10 - k)^2 + 2k(10 - k) = 102 - (k - 1)^2    ] 10. The maximum value occurs when (k - 1)^2 is minimized, i.e., k = 2. 11. Substituting k = 2, we have:    [    n = 102 - (2 - 1)^2 = 102 - 1 = 101    ] 12. To verify, we construct a graph with 21 vertices as follows:     - Let G's 21 vertices be A_1, A_2, cdots, A_{21}.    - Set X = {A_1, A_2, cdots, A_5}, Y = {A_6, A_8, A_{10}, cdots, A_{20}}, Z = {A_7, A_9, A_{11}, cdots, A_{21}}.    - X: vertices form a 5-cycle.    - Y and Z: every vertex in Y connects to every vertex in Z.    - Y: vertices A_6, A_8, cdots, A_{20} connect to A_1 and A_3.    - Z: vertices A_7, A_9, cdots, A_{21} connect to A_2 and A_4.        Thus, the graph contains:    [    n = 5 + 8 times 8 + 2 times 8 times 2 = 101    ] 13.

Let points N, N_1, and N_2 be the nine-point centers of triangle ABC, triangle ABD, and triangle ACD, respectively. We denote O' as the center of the circle passing through points A, O, O_1, and O_2, known as the Salmon circle.

Additionally, it is known (by hypothesis or derived Lemma) that the nine-point centers N, N_1, and N_2 of these triangles are the midpoints of segments from A to the reflection of O across BC. 3. **Reflection and Nine-Point Center:**    According to Euclidean geometry, the nine-point center of a triangle is the midpoint of the segment joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter. Thus, N is the midpoint of AH, where H is the orthocenter. Similarly, N_1 and N_2 are midpoints of AH' and AH'', where H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC and H' and H'' are orthocenters for triangle ABD and triangle ACD respectively. 4. **Configuration and Midpoints in the Salmon Circle:**    We know O' is on the perpendicular bisector of BC, and we extend its properties considering the cyclic nature involving N, N_1, N_2, and E:    - E is the midpoint of A and an antipodal point lying on BC due to perpendicular dropped from A.    - The nine-point centers being midpoints and their geometric reflection symmetry, naturally infer the reflection through O', which aligns with the construction of perpendicular dropped from O' to BC. 5. **Conclusion: Cyclicity of H, E, N, N_1, and N_2:**    The properties of the Salmon circle and reflection symmetries assert that H, E, N, N_1, and N_2 are concyclic. This conclusion follows from the invariance under the reflection and perpendicular bisector arguments with respect to the common traits of the Salmon circle configuration described earlier.

Therefore, to find the sales amount on a good week, we calculate:    [    800 times 2 = 1600    ]    So, on a good week, she sells 1600 worth of goods. 2. **Calculate total sales for 5 good weeks**: Now that we know the sales amount for a good week, we can find out the total sales for 5 good weeks by multiplying the weekly sales by the number of good weeks:    [    5 times 1600 = 8000    ]    Thus, the total sales for 5 good weeks amount to 8000. 3. **Calculate total sales for 3 tough weeks**: Since we already know that on a tough week she sells 800 worth of goods, the total sales for 3 tough weeks can be calculated as:    [    3 times 800 = 2400    ]    Therefore, the total sales for 3 tough weeks amount to 2400. 4. **Find the total sales for both good and tough weeks**: To find the total amount of money she makes, we add the sales from the good weeks to the sales from the tough weeks:    [    2400 + 8000 = 10400    ]    Hence, the total amount of money Haji's mother makes after 5 good weeks and 3 tough weeks is boxed{10400}."},{"instruction":"Let ABCDE be a convex pentagon with AB parallel CE, BC parallel AD, AC parallel DE, angle ABC=120^circ, AB=3, BC=5, and DE = 15.

Let's first express (sin 2x), (sin 2y), and (sin 2z) using double-angle formulas:    [    sin 2x = 2sin x cos x, quad sin 2y = 2sin y cos y, quad sin 2z = 2sin z cos z    ] 3.

We analyze the geometric implications of these points on the unit circle. When constructing vertical lines through these points, they form rectangles in the plane. 8. The right-hand side of the inequality represents the sum of the areas of these rectangles formed by the projections of the points above on the unit circle.

Each term (sin x (cos x - cos y)), (sin y (cos y - cos z)), and (sin z cos z) corresponds to the area of one of these rectangles. 10. Since (0 < x < y < z < frac{pi}{2}), the total area of these rectangles is less than (frac{pi}{4}) because these projections are constrained within the unit circle's first quadrant. 11.

The equation of the line can be obtained as: y = sqrt{3}(x - 2). Let the line intersect the parabola at points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). By solving the equations together and eliminating y, we get 3x^2 - 20x + 12 = 0. Therefore, x_1 + x_2 = frac{20}{3}. According to the definition of the parabola, we have |AF| = x_1 + frac{p}{2} = x_1 + 2, |BF| = x_2 + frac{p}{2} = x_2 + 2.

By finding the focus of the parabola as F(2, 0) and the slope of the line as k = tan 60^circ = sqrt{3}, we can derive the equation of the line. Solving the line equation together with the parabola equation by eliminating y gives 3x^2 - 20x + 12 = 0. Using the relationship between the roots and coefficients, we find x_1 + x_2 = frac{20}{3}. Further calculation based on the definition of the parabola yields the length of the chord intercepted by the parabola from the line.

Prove that it is possible, through a finite number of moves, to combine all the balls into a single pile.","output":"1. **Base Case (Induction Initialization):**     - Let us first verify the claim for the base case when ( n = 1 ).      - Here, ( 2^n = 2^1 = 2 ), so we have 2 balls.     There are two scenarios:     - **One Single Pile**: If there is already one pile with all 2 balls, no movement (or rearrangement) is needed.     - **Two Piles**: If the balls are in two separate piles with one ball in each, we can move one ball from one pile to the other in one step. This results in one pile containing both balls.      Hence, the base case for ( n = 1 ) is proven. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**     - Assume that for ( n = k ), where ( k ) is any positive integer, our hypothesis holds. That is, starting with ( 2^k ) balls, we can rearrange these balls into a single pile through a finite number of operations. 3. **Inductive Step:**     - Now, we need to prove that the hypothesis holds for ( n = k + 1 ). Hence, we have ( 2^{k+1} ) balls initially distributed in various piles.     Consider the following points:     - The number of balls in each pile can be either even or odd.     - According to basic properties of numbers, the total number of individual piles containing odd numbers of balls must be even (otherwise the sum of an odd number of odd piles would be odd, contradicting the premise that ( 2^{k+1} ) is even).     Treat the operation of moving balls between piles:     - Pair up these piles containing an odd number of balls. By moving a number of balls between these paired-up piles, we will make the number of balls in each pile even. This step does not increase the total number of piles.     - After this pairing, each pile will contain an even number of balls. 4. **Transformation:**     - Consider each pair of balls in these even piles. Imagine combining each pair into a 'super ball'. This effectively transforms the problem into one of having ( 2^k ) 'super balls'. 5. **Application of the Induction Hypothesis:**     - By the induction hypothesis, we know that ( 2^k ) can be rearranged into a single pile through a finite number of moves.     - Once all 'super balls' are combined into a single 'super ball' pile, we can simply split each 'super ball' back into two original balls. This results in ( 2^{k+1} ) balls in a single pile. Hence, by the method of mathematical induction, we have proven that no matter the distribution of balls into piles, through a finite sequence of moves, they can all be combined into a single pile.

With this shift, scores range now from 0 to 10, and the known score for the fifth test transforms to (90 - 85 = 5). Let's explore possible scenarios for the remaining four scores. Each score needs to be distinct and fit within the set (S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}). To keep the average of all test scores an integer, the sum (s) of all five scores must satisfy (s equiv 0 mod 5). The score of the fifth test is already 5, which simplifies our condition to needing the sum of the four other scores to also be divisible by 5. We compute the bounds for possible sums of four different numbers. The sums can vary from (0+1+2+3 = 6) to (7+8+9+10 = 34). Adding 5 to these sums gives a range from (11) to (39), and the sums of interest are (15), (20), (25), (30), (35). All of these values meet the divisibility condition by 5 when considering the contributions of the four scores. The sum of 20, for instance, requires a selection of numbers such as (0+4+6+10 = 20) (adding 5 from the fifth score, we get 25, divisible by 5). This leaves the fourth score as 10 when shifted back, or (10 + 85 = 95). After laying out all possible combinations of scores, one can conclude that these are the valid solutions, meeting all constraints including original score boundaries (from 85 to 95), distinct integer requirements, and tested sum constraints.

The condition given is that in every rectangle of dimensions (A times B) or (B times A), at least one cell is colored. 2. **Initial Setup:**    We situate our grid in the Cartesian plane such that the bottom-left corner of every cell is a lattice point.

We are given a circle with a radius of (16) and (650) points inside this circle. We need to prove that there exists an annulus (a ring-shaped region) with an inner radius of (2) and an outer radius of (3) that contains at least (10) of these (650) points. 2. To start, notice that a point (X) lies within an annulus with center (O) if and only if the point (O) lies within an annulus with center (X). Therefore, it suffices to demonstrate that if we construct annuli with centers at the given (650) points, then one of these points will be covered by at least (10) annuli. 3. The given problem essentially reduces to showing that one point in the considered circle will be contained in at least (10) annuli centered at the given points. 4. We can inscribe the annuli in a larger circle. Each annulus has an inner radius of (2) and an outer radius of (3). Therefore, the annuli themselves have a maximal radius of (16 + 3 = 19). The area of this larger circle is:    [    text{Area of the circle with radius } 19 = pi times 19^2 = 361pi.    ] 5.

To show that there is a point covered by at least (10) annuli, we use a combinatorial argument:    - Divide the total area covered by annuli, (3250pi), by the area of the larger circle, (361pi):      [      frac{3250pi}{361pi} approx 9.      ]    This indicates that, on average, every point in the large circle is covered by roughly (9) annuli. 8. By the pigeonhole principle, since (9) is an average, there must be at least one point that is covered by more than (9) annuli. Thus, there is a point that is covered by at least (10) annuli. # Conclusion: Therefore, we have proven that there exists an annulus with an inner radius of (2) and an outer radius of (3) that contains at least (10) of the given (650) points.

This radius is common to all the inscribed polygons, including the equilateral triangle, square, and hexagon. 1. **For the Equilateral Triangle:**    - The side length can be found using the formula for the side of a polygon inscribed in a circle, which is 2rsin(theta), where theta is the central angle corresponding to the side.    - For an equilateral triangle, theta = 60^{circ}, so the side length is 2rsin(60^{circ}).    - Using the trigonometric identity, sin(60^{circ}) = sqrt{3}/2, we find the side length to be 2r cdot sqrt{3}/2 = sqrt{3}r. 2. **For the Square:**    - Similarly, for the square, theta = 45^{circ}, so the side length is 2rsin(45^{circ}).    - Since sin(45^{circ}) = sqrt{2}/2, the side length of the square is 2r cdot sqrt{2}/2 = sqrt{2}r. 3. **For the Hexagon:**    - A hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The side length of each triangle is equal to the radius of the circle.    - Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is simply r. Combining these results, we find that the ratio of the side lengths of the inscribed equilateral triangle, square, and hexagon, all of which have the same radius, is sqrt{3}r:sqrt{2}r:r.

This means there exist infinitely many positive integers m such that {m^2 alpha} falls within any subinterval of [0, 1), in particular, within left(frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}right).

According to the given information, 3 women do as much work as 2 men. Therefore, we can write the following equation: [ 3w = 2m ] Now, let's calculate the total amount of work done by the men and women. For the men: The total work done by the men is the product of the number of men, the number of days they worked, and the number of hours they worked each day. Let's denote the number of men as ( M ). So, the total work done by the men is: [ M times 21 text{ days} times 8 text{ hours/day} = M times 21 times 8m ] For the women: The total work done by the women is the product of the number of women, the number of days they worked, and the number of hours they worked each day. Since there are 21 women, the total work done by the women is: [ 21 times 60 text{ days} times 3 text{ hours/day} = 21 times 60 times 3w ] Since the total amount of work done by the men and women is the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other: [ M times 21 times 8m = 21 times 60 times 3w ] Now, we can substitute ( 3w ) with ( 2m ) (from the first equation): [ M times 21 times 8m = 21 times 60 times 2m ] We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by ( 21m ): [ M times 8 = 60 times 2 ] [ M times 8 = 120 ] Now, we can solve for ( M ): [ M = frac{120}{8} ] [ M = 15 ] Therefore, there were boxed{15}  men working on the piece of work."},{"instruction":"Consider the ellipse C: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0), and let line l intersect the ellipse at points P and Q.

Since M is the midpoint of segment PQ, we can write the coordinates as follows: x_M = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, quad y_M = frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} 2. The slope of line OM is given by k_2 = frac{y_M}{x_M}. 3. Now, recall that the slope of a line perpendicular to a given line is the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. Since line l is perpendicular to line OM, we can write: k_1 = -frac{1}{k_2} = -frac{x_M}{y_M} 4. Given that {k_1}{k_2}=-frac{2}{3}, we have: -frac{x_M}{y_M} cdot frac{y_M}{x_M} = -frac{2}{3} Rightarrow -frac{2}{3} = -frac{2}{3} 5. From the given equation of the ellipse, we know that the coordinates of points P and Q satisfy the equation: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 6. To find the eccentricity (e) of the ellipse, we use the formula: e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}} 7. However, we don't have direct information about a and b. To proceed, we need to find a relationship between k_1, k_2, a, and b. 8. To do this, we can use the property that the product of the slopes of lines drawn from the focus of the ellipse to any point on the ellipse is equal to the negative of the square of the eccentricity: k_1 cdot k_F = -e^2 where k_F is the slope of the line from the focus to the point on the ellipse. 9. Since k_1 k_2 = -frac{2}{3} and k_1 cdot k_F = -e^2, we can write: k_F = frac{k_2}{e^2} 10. Now, let's find the coordinates of the focus, F(c, 0), using the equation c = ae. The slope of line FM can be written as: k_F = frac{y_M - 0}{x_M - c} = frac{y_M}{x_M - c} 11. Combining the expressions for k_F from steps 9 and 11, we have: frac{y_M}{x_M - c} = frac{k_2}{e^2} 12.

We are to investigate cases when there are fewer than nine such line segments due to overlaps. Let's consider each case step-by-step.  Case 1: Equilateral Triangle  In an equilateral triangle, each angle bisector is also a median and an altitude. This gives us: - 3 altitudes - 3 medians - 3 angle bisectors Since each of these coincides exactly, we don't have any fewer unique line segments. Thus, all tri-segment properties are represented exactly: [ boxed{9} ]  Case 2: Isosceles Triangle For an isosceles triangle, consider the two equal sides: - 3 altitudes    begin{itemize}     item (vertex connecting to the base, and the perpendiculars from the two base vertices)   end{itemize} - 3 medians   begin{itemize}     item (vertex from equal sides and the center of base)    end{itemize} - 3 angle bisectors    begin{itemize}       item (again one from vertex connecting to the base, and two halves each bisecting the base vertex angles)   end{itemize} However, for an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle also serves as the median and the angle bisector of the vertex angle, so these overlap. Hence, the three specific cases need to be revisited: - 1 overlap of three features - 2 altitudes that are not other features - 2 medians that are not other features - 2 angle bisectors not other features    Thus, in total, we get: [ 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 ] Concluding this results in: [ boxed{7} ]  Case 3: Right Triangle In a right triangle: - 2 altitudes    begin{itemize}     item (one from the right angle, perpendiculars from legs)   end{itemize} - 1 altitude coinciding with one leg - 2 medians    begin{itemize}     item (one from the hypotenuse)   end{itemize} - 1 median coinciding with one leg - 2 angle bisectors   begin{itemize}     item (one from hypotenuse to right angle)   end{itemize} - 1 angle bisector coinciding with one leg   Specifically, the scenario with one angle being right, we observe: [ 3text{ altitudes} = 3text{ medians} = 3text{ angle bisectors} ] This ensures: [ 3text{ coinciding lines and }2+2-2=5 ] Thus, verifying: [ boxed{9} ]  Case 4: Singular Overlap  If the triangle, in particular cases, results in median coinciding, let’s summarize the count: [ 3 , 3 , 3 , 1 = 3, 3 , 3 -1 ] Correction, so: Concluding final scenario unique: boxed{3}"},{"instruction":"Find the dividend if the divisor is k and the quotient is 8.

It starts snowing at midnight and the snowfall will continue without interruption for 24 hours. During the first 16 hours of snowfall, the sled's speed increases steadily. At the beginning of the snowfall, the sled cannot be moved, but by the end of the 16th hour, it can travel very fast. However, after the 16th hour, the increasing snow thickness starts to slow down the sled steadily over the next 8 hours until its speed reaches zero. Mikulás does not want to fatigue the reindeer pulling the sled for more than 8 hours. When should Mikulás set off if he wants to cover the maximum distance?","output":"To determine the optimal time for Mikulás to start his journey in order to travel the longest distance, we analyze the velocity-time graph and compute the distances he can cover during both phases of his journey. 1. **Velocity during snowfall:**    Mikulás cannot move the sled at the beginning when snowfall starts ((t = 0)). Over the first 16 hours ((0 leq t leq 16)), the sled’s speed increases linearly to a maximum speed (m).         Thus, the velocity function for the first 16 hours can be expressed as:    [    v(t) = frac{m}{16} t, quad text{for} quad 0 leq t leq 16    ] 2. **Velocity after 16 hours:**    After reaching the maximum speed (m) at 16 hours, the velocity decreases linearly to zero over the next 8 hours ((16 leq t leq 24)).    Thus, the velocity function from hour 16 to 24 is:    [    v(t) = m - frac{m}{8} (t - 16), quad text{for} quad 16 leq t leq 24    ] 3. **Trip analysis:**    Suppose Mikulás starts his journey at time (S) and travels for a maximum of 8 hours, arriving at time (T).    Let’s denote (S = 16 - x) and (T = 24 - x). 4. **Area under the velocity-time curve:**    The area under this curve corresponds to the distance traveled. We split this area into two trapezoids:     - Trapezoid (A S M C) (from start to maximum speed),    - Trapezoid (C M T B) (from maximum speed to end). 5. **Distance during the increase phase (Trapezoid ASM):**    By the parallel intercept theorem, the proportion is found using:    [    frac{AS}{CM} = frac{16-x}{16} implies AS = m left(1 - frac{x}{16}right)    ]    Thus, distance during the increasing speed phase is:    [    t_{ASM} = frac{x}{2} left(m + m left(1 - frac{x}{16}right) right) = frac{x}{2} m left(2 - frac{x}{16}right)    ] 6. **Distance during the decrease phase (Trapezoid CMTB):**    Similarly, using,    [    frac{BT}{CM} = frac{x}{8} implies BT = frac{mx}{8}    ]    Thus, distance during the decreasing speed phase is:    [    t_{CMTB} = frac{8-x}{2} left(m + frac{mx}{8} right) = frac{8-x}{2} m left(1 + frac{x}{8} right)    ] 7. **Total distance:**    Sum of areas under both trapezoids gives total distance.    [    begin{aligned}    t_{ASM} + t_{CMTB} & = frac{x}{2} m left(2 - frac{x}{16}right) + frac{8-x}{2} m left(1 + frac{x}{8}right)     & = frac{m}{2} left[ x left(2 - frac{x}{16}right) + (8 - x) left(1 + frac{x}{8}right) right]     & = frac{m}{2} left[ 2x - frac{x^2}{16} + 8 - x + frac{x^2}{8} - frac{x^2}{8} right]     & = frac{m}{2} left[ 2x + 8 - x - x left(frac{1}{16} ) right]     & = frac{m}{32} left( - left(x - frac{16}{3}right)^2 + frac{256}{9} right) + 4m     end{aligned}    ] 8. **Optimization:**    Maximize the quadratic term yields (x = frac{16}{3}).

The price of the erasers is 1/2 the price of the pencils.  In addition, a tax is applied to the purchase depending on the number of bundles: no tax for purchasing 10 or fewer bundles, a 5% tax for purchasing 1115 bundles, and a 10% tax for purchasing 16 or more bundles. If the store sold a total of 20 bundles and earned 80 aftertax, how much do the erasers cost individually before the tax and discounts?","output":"Let's denote the price of a pencil as ( P ) and the price of an eraser as ( E ). According to the information given, the price of the erasers is half the price of the pencils, so ( E = frac{1}{2}P ). A bundle consists of 1 pencil and 2 erasers, so the price of a bundle before any discounts or taxes is ( P + 2E ). Substituting the value of ( E ) into the equation, we get ( P + 2(frac{1}{2}P) = P + P = 2P ). The store sold a total of 20 bundles, and for 20 bundles, there is a 30% discount. So the discounted price of a bundle is ( 2P times (1 - 0.30) = 2P times 0.70 = 1.4P ). Since 20 bundles were sold, the total price before tax is ( 20 times 1.4P = 28P ). For 20 bundles, there is also a 10% tax applied. So the total price after tax is ( 28P times (1 + 0.10) = 28P times 1.10 = 30.8P ). We are given that the store earned 80 after-tax, so ( 30.8P = 80 ). To find the price of a pencil ( P ), we solve for ( P ): ( P = frac{80}{30.8} approx 2.5974 ). Now, we can find the price of an eraser ( E ) before tax and discounts: ( E = frac{1}{2}P = frac{1}{2} times 2.5974 approx 1.2987 ). Therefore, the cost of an eraser individually before tax and discounts is approximately boxed{1.30} ."},{"instruction":"Prove that if  n  is a positive integer such that the equation [x^{3}3xy^{2}+y^{3}=n.] has a solution in integers  (x,y),  then it has at least three such solutions.

Since ( (x, y) ), ( (y - x, -x) ), and ( (-y, x - y) ) are distinct solutions unless ( x = y = 0 ) (which would make ( n = 0 ), contradicting the assumption that ( n ) is a positive integer), we have shown that there are at least three solutions. 2. **Show that the equation has no solutions in integers when ( n = 2891 ):**    Assume there exist integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that:    [    x^3 - 3xy^2 + y^3 = 2891    ]    Consider the equation modulo 9. Note that any integer cube is congruent to ( -1, 0, ) or ( 1 pmod{9} ).    Since ( 2891 equiv 2 pmod{9} ), we analyze the possible values of ( x^3 ) and ( y^3 ) modulo 9:    - If ( x equiv 0 pmod{3} ) or ( y equiv 0 pmod{3} ), then ( x^3 equiv 0 pmod{9} ) or ( y^3 equiv 0 pmod{9} ), respectively. This would imply:      [      x^3 - 3xy^2 equiv 0 pmod{9} quad text{or} quad -3xy^2 + y^3 equiv 0 pmod{9}      ]      leading to ( y^3 equiv 2 pmod{9} ) or ( x^3 equiv 2 pmod{9} ), which is impossible since 2 is not a cube modulo 9.    Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) cannot be congruent to 0 modulo 3. Thus, ( x^3 ) and ( y^3 ) can only be ( pm 1 pmod{9} ).    - If ( x^3 equiv -1 pmod{9} ) and ( y^3 equiv 1 pmod{9} ) or vice versa, then:      [      x^3 + y^3 equiv 0 pmod{9}      ]      This implies:      [      -3xy^2 equiv 2 pmod{9}      ]      which is impossible since ( 3 mid -3xy^2 ).    - If ( x^3 equiv y^3 pmod{9} ), then:      [      x^3 + y^3 equiv 2 pmod{9} quad text{or} quad -2 pmod{9}      ]      leading to:      [      -3xy^2 equiv 0 pmod{9} quad text{or} quad 4 pmod{9}      ]      However, ( -3xy^2 equiv 0 pmod{9} ) implies ( 3 mid xy^2 ), contradicting the earlier result that ( x ) and ( y ) are not congruent to 0 modulo 3.

This forms an eight-pointed star inscribed inside the circle. 2. **Geometric Transformation and Visualization:**    - Within this configuration, we focus on the white figure formed by the intersection of these squares. The four grey triangles around the edges of the squares are removed, and they do not affect the coverage.     - The resulting shape is an octagonal region which surrounds the circle, touching it only at four points. 3. **Manipulating the Circle:**    - By shifting the circle to the right, it still remains within the original figure, touching only one side ( CE ) at one singular point of contact, ( S ). 4. **Verification of Coverage:**    - Even after slightly increasing the circle size using a homothety centered at ( S ), the circle will not touch side ( AD ).    - Therefore, parts of the original figure outside this modified circle can be connected—specifically, the triangular regions can be joined along a bridge outside the circle. 5. **Final Dissection:**    - Given the above settings and transformations, it is feasible to extract a specific red figure from the initial square ( ABCD ) which can cover separate triangular parts remaining uncovered by the circle.    - This demonstrates that the initial square of side length 1 can be divided into two parts that together cover a circle of a diameter greater than 1. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"instruction":"Prove that if (0 < x, y, z < b), then  frac{x}{b^{2}+b y+z x}+frac{y}{b^{2}+b z+x y}+frac{z}{b^{2}+b x+y z}<frac{1}{b}","output":"We are given the inequality: [ frac{x}{b^{2}+b y+z x}+frac{y}{b^{2}+b z+x y}+frac{z}{b^{2}+b x+y z}<frac{1}{b} ] where (0 < x, y, z < b).  1. **Analyzing the denominators**:    Let's examine the general form of the denominators, i.e., ( b^2 + b y + zx ).

Considering the monotonicity of odd functions in symmetric intervals, we can conclude that f(x) is increasing on [-2, 2].

First, let's analyze the first condition ( fleft(frac{x}{3}right) = frac{f(x)}{2} ):    - For ( x = 1 ):      [      fleft(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{f(1)}{2} = frac{2018}{2} = 1009      ]    - For ( x = frac{1}{3} ):      [      fleft(frac{1}{9}right) = frac{fleft(frac{1}{3}right)}{2} = frac{1009}{2} = 504.5      ] 3.

Now, let's find ( fleft(frac{12}{13}right) ):    - We need to find a pattern or a specific value that fits the given conditions. Notice that ( f(10x) = 2018 - f(x) ) implies a symmetry around 1009. For ( x = frac{12}{13} ):      [      fleft(frac{12}{13}right) = 2018 - fleft(frac{1}{13}right)      ]    - To find ( fleft(frac{1}{13}right) ), we use the first condition:      [      fleft(frac{1}{13}right) = frac{fleft(frac{3}{13}right)}{2}      ]      and so on, but this becomes complex without a clear pattern. 5. Given the constraints and the symmetry, we can infer that ( fleft(frac{12}{13}right) ) should be close to 1009, but since ( f ) is monotonically increasing and ( f(1) = 2018 ), we can deduce:    [    fleft(frac{12}{13}right) = 2018 - fleft(frac{1}{13}right)    ]    Since ( fleft(frac{1}{13}right) ) is very small, ( fleft(frac{12}{13}right) ) is very close to 2018.

Therefore, the next jump length the flea will make is (2^k + 1). 4. **Construct a Sequence of Jumps**:    - To move from point (n) to (n+1), let's consider the flea making the following sequence of jumps:      - (2^k) jumps to the left, followed by one jump to the right. 5. **Mathematical Expression**:     - After making (2^k) jumps to the left, the total displacement is:      [      -left(2^k + 1 + 2^{k+1} + 1 + ldots + 2^{k+2^k-1} + 1right)      ]    - There are (2^k) terms, so the total displacement becomes:      [      -sum_{j=0}^{2^k-1} (2^{k+j} + 1) = -left(sum_{j=0}^{2^k-1} 2^{k+j} + sum_{j=0}^{2^k-1} 1right)      ]    - Simplifying, we get:      [      -left(2^k sum_{j=0}^{2^k-1} 2^j + 2^k right) = -left(2^k cdot 2^{2^k} + 2^kright) = -2^{k+2^k} - 2^k      ] 6. **Final Right Jump**:     - Now, add (2^k + 1) to the right:      [      -2^{k+2^k} - 2^k + 2^k + 1 = -2^{k+2^k} + 1      ]    - Therefore, the flea's net displacement from (n) over one entire set of jumps is:      [      n + left(-2^{k+2^k} + 1right) + 2^{k+2^k} = n + 1      ] Hence, the flea can indeed move from any point (n) to the next point (n+1).

Next, we calculate the cost of the pieces of chocolate: - Each piece of chocolate costs ¢75, so for two pieces, the cost is 75 times 2 = ¢150.

Let X' be another binary string of length n which differs from X in all n positions.    - The vice-leader writes down all binary strings that differ from X in exactly k positions.    - If k = frac{n}{2}, then any guess made by the competitor cannot distinguish uniquely between X and X'. This is because any binary string differing from X in exactly k positions will have the same property against X'. Thus, to be sure, the competitor needs to guess both X and X'. Therefore, the number of guesses required is 2 in this case. 3. **Case 2: n neq 2k**        - Here the minimum number of guesses required is 1.    - Let's consider an arbitrary binary string Y of length n which differs from X in m positions, where 0 < m < 2k.    - Suppose there exists a string Z that differs from X in exactly k positions. The vice-leader will note this Z down.    - The key argument here is that for 0 < m < 2k, |m-k| < k. This means that the string Y cannot be confused with X from the information given by the binary string differing by k positions. 4. **General Considerations and Conclusion**        - For k geq frac{n}{2}, if n < 2k, every string that differs from X will differ by fewer than 2k positions.    - If n = 2k, only X and X' differ exactly by k positions in between each other, leading back to the conclusion of needing two guesses due to indistinguishability.    - If n neq 2k, a single guess can determine the leader's choice because of the asymmetry in the differing positions being less distinctive than exactly 2k.

Thus \\"a^2 > b^2\\" does not imply \\"a > |b|\\". Therefore, \\"a^2 > b^2\\" being true is not a necessary condition for \\"a > |b|\\" to be true.

Assume ( c(f_1) + c(f_2) ge n + 2 ). 6. **Lemma:**    Given two partitions ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) of ( S ) satisfying ( |P_1| + |P_2| ge n + 2 ), there exists a proper subset ( R subset S ) such that:    - ( R ) is the union of ( p_1 ) parts of ( P_1 ) and ( p_2 ) parts of ( P_2 ) for some ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ).    - ( |R| ge p_1 + p_2 - 1 ). 7. **Proof of Lemma:**    - Start with an arbitrary part ( A ) of ( P_1 ) and color it red.    - Color blue all parts in ( P_2 ) containing elements from ( A ).    - Continue this process: color red all parts in ( P_1 ) containing elements from blue parts, and color blue all parts in ( P_2 ) containing elements from red parts.    - Let ( |R|(t) ), ( p_1(t) ), and ( p_2(t) ) denote the number of elements in red parts, the number of red parts, and the number of blue parts at step ( t ), respectively.    - Prove by induction that ( |R|(t) ge p_1(t) + p_2(t) - 1 ). 8. **Termination of Process:**    - The process terminates when no new parts need to be colored.    - Let ( R ) be the union of red parts at the end of the process.    - ( R ) is a proper subset of ( S ) because if ( R = S ), then ( n = |S| = |R| ge p_1 + p_2 - 1 = |P_1| + |P_2| - 1 ge n + 1 ), a contradiction. 9. **Invariant Subset:**    - ( R ) is invariant under ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ), so it is invariant under ( f_1 circ f_2 ).    - ( R ) can be partitioned into orbits of ( f_1 circ f_2 ), containing at least one orbit. 10. **Restriction to ( S setminus R ):**     - Define ( f_1' ) and ( f_2' ) as restrictions of ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ) to ( S setminus R ).     - ( f_1' ) and ( f_2' ) are permutations of ( S setminus R ).     - ( c(f_1') = c(f_1) - p_1 ) and ( c(f_2') = c(f_2) - p_2 ). 11. **Inductive Hypothesis:**     - By the inductive hypothesis:     [     c(f_1' circ f_2') ge c(f_1') + c(f_2') - |S setminus R|     ]     - Substituting:     [     c(f_1' circ f_2') ge c(f_1) + c(f_2) - p_1 - p_2 - (n - |R|)     ]     - Using ( |R| ge p_1 + p_2 - 1 ):     [     c(f_1' circ f_2') ge c(f_1) + c(f_2) - n - 1     ] 12. **Conclusion:**     - Since ( c(f_1 circ f_2) ge 1 + c(f_1' circ f_2') ):     [     c(f_1 circ f_2) ge c(f_1) + c(f_2) - n     ]     - This completes the induction and the proof.

Hence, [ 1 - (x^{n+1} + y^{n+1} + z^{n+1}) leq 1 - 3^{-(n+1)}. ] 14. Therefore, we have: [ frac{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2}{1 - 3^{-(n+1)}} geq frac{frac{1}{9}}{1 - 3^{-(n+1)}} = frac{1}{9(1 - 3^{-(n+1)})}. ] 15. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ frac{1}{9(1 - 3^{-(n+1)})} = frac{1}{9 cdot left(frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{3^{n+1}}right)} = frac{3^{n+1}}{9 cdot (3^{n+1} - 1)} = frac{3^n}{3^{n-2} - 9}. ] 16.

If P is divisible by 4, then:    [    K_{n+1}(P) = K_{n-1}left(frac{P}{4}right)    ] 7. If P is odd, weight 1 must be used and it can be placed on either side. Thus, we consider weights P-1 and P+1:    [    K_{n+1}(P) = K_{n+1}(P-1) + K_{n+1}(P+1)    ]     8.

For each P_{n+1} in the above sequence, the pair of numbers P_{n+1}-1 and P_{n+1}+1 coincide with the pair of numbers 2P_n and 4P_{n-1}. 13. This matches the relationship we used in part (a), thus:     [     K_{n+1}(P_{n+1}) = K_n(P_n) + K_{n-1}(P_{n-1})     ] 14. Given that K_1(P_1) = 2 and K_2(P_2) = 3, we can sequentially calculate:     [     K_9(171) = 89     ] Therefore, the weight 171 grams can be balanced in exactly 89 ways. # Conclusion [ boxed{171} ]"},{"instruction":"Given an ellipse C: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0) with eccentricity frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, and the distance from one endpoint of the minor axis to the right focus is sqrt{3}.

This ensures that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor (the central vertex). 4. **Counting the Edges:**    - In a star graph with 2014 vertices, the central vertex is connected to the remaining 2013 vertices.    - Therefore, the number of edges in this configuration is 2013. 5. **Verification:**    - If there are fewer than 2013 edges, the graph is not connected, meaning there exist at least two vertices with no path between them.    - Adding an edge between any two such vertices would not necessarily form a triangle, contradicting the problem's requirement. 6. **Generalization:**    - For ( n ) points, the minimum number of edges required to ensure that adding any additional edge forms a triangle is ( n-1 ).

Using the divisibility rule for 4:    - A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

This is because the simplest polygon with which one can form a face is a triangle.        Since any two faces share a common edge, the maximum number of edges a face can have is constrained by the number of faces ( n ). Specifically, a face can have at most ( n-1 ) sides because each of its sides is shared with a different face. 3. **Range of Possible Number of Sides:**    Therefore, the number of sides that a face can have ranges from 3 to ( n-1 ). This gives us a total of ( n-3+1 = n-2 ) possible different number of sides a face can have (3, 4, 5, ..., ( n-1 )). 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:**    We now have ( n ) faces but only ( n-2 ) possible numbers of sides that these faces can have.

First, we identify the general term of the expansion of (1-x)^{6}. The general term, denoted as {T}_{r+1}, can be expressed using the binomial theorem as {T}_{r+1}={C}_{6}^{r}(-x)^{r}. Simplifying this, we get {T}_{r+1}=(-1)^{r}{C}_{6}^{r}{x}^{r}. 2. Next, we need to find the coefficient of x^{4} in the expansion of (2+ax)(1-x)^{6}. This can be achieved by considering the contributions from both parts of the binomial (2+ax):    - The term 2 contributes 2(-1)^{4}{C}_{6}^{4}{x}^{4} to the expansion.    - The term ax contributes a(-1)^{3}{C}_{6}^{3}{x}^{4} to the expansion, since we need to consider the term from (1-x)^{6} that will give us x^3 to multiply by x and get x^4. 3. Combining these contributions, the coefficient of x^{4} is given by the sum of these two parts: 2(-1)^{4}{C}_{6}^{4} + a(-1)^{3}{C}_{6}^{3}.

Otherwise, it would not be possible for their sum to be zero.     3. **Step 2: Analyze the product condition (abc = 1):**    - The product of the three numbers is positive ((1 > 0)).     - To get a positive product from three real numbers, the following possibilities exist for the signs of (a, b,) and (c):      1. All three numbers could be positive: impossible because their sum wouldn't be zero.      2. One number is positive and two numbers are negative.      3.

This is because each rook must be placed in a unique row and a unique column. This can be done by permuting the columns for a fixed arrangement of rows:    - First row: ( m ) choices.    - Second row: ( m-1 ) choices.    - ( ldots )    - Last row: ( 1 ) choice. 3. **Formulating the Proof by Contradiction:**    Assume the assertion is false. That is, it is not possible to place ( n ) rooks such that no two rooks attack each other and all rooks are placed on cells of different colors. 4. **Counting the Non-attacking Arrangements:**    Given the false assumption:    - Any arrangement of ( n ) non-attacking rooks on the ( n times n ) board involves at least one pair of rooks being on cells of the same color.    - Therefore, if the board is colored as specified, the number of valid non-attacking rook configurations would not exceed the configurations where ( left(n^2 / 2right)(n-2)! ) are valid. 5. **Deriving a Contradiction:**    - The total number of ways to place ( n ) non-attacking rooks on an ( n times n ) board exactly equals ( n! ).    - Given the false assumption, the number of valid placements should be ( leq left(n^2 / 2 right) cdot (n-2)! ).        Thus, we have:    [    n! leq left(frac{n^2}{2}right) (n-2)!    ] 6. **Simplifying the Inequality:**    Let's divide both sides by ((n-2)!):    [    frac{n!}{(n-2)!} leq frac{n^2}{2}    ]    This simplifies to:    [    n(n-1) leq frac{n^2}{2}    ]    Simplify further:    [    2n(n-1) leq n^2    ]    [    2n^2 - 2n leq n^2    ]    [    n^2 - 2n leq 0    ]    Since ( n > 2 ):    [    n(n - 2) leq 0    ] This results in a contradiction because for ( n > 2 ), ( n(n-2) > 0 ). Our assumption that it is not possible to place ( n ) rooks such that they fulfill the conditions is incorrect. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is indeed possible to place ( n ) rooks on the ( n times n ) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other and all rooks are placed on cells of different colors.

Given that the tempo consumes 30% more petrol in the city than on the highway for the same distance, we can set up a ratio to find the fuel efficiency on the highway. Let the distance the tempo can travel on the highway using one litre of petrol be ( x ) km. Since the tempo consumes 30% more petrol in the city, it means that for every 1 litre of petrol used on the highway, it would use 1.3 litres in the city for the same distance. So, we have the following proportion: [ frac{19.5 text{ km}}{1.3 text{ litres}} = frac{x text{ km}}{1 text{ litre}} ] Solving for ( x ): [ x = frac{19.5 text{ km}}{1.3} = 15 text{ km} ] This means the tempo can travel 15 km on the highway using one litre of petrol.

So, our example shows that faecdb is reachable from abcdef. Prove that for any two strings A and B, A is reachable from B if and only if B is reachable from A.","output":"1. Begin by noting the problem conditions: we have two strings, ( A ) and ( B ), such that ( A ) is reachable from ( B ) if and only if ( B ) is reachable from ( A ). Specifically, this means that through the insertion of left-arrow keys (leftarrow), typing ( A ) will result in ( B ), and vice versa. 2. Recognize that for this bijective relationship to hold, the characters in ( A ) and ( B ) must be identical in terms of frequency. This ensures that the only difference between ( A ) and ( B ) is the order of characters, not their occurrence.

Specifically, the necessity of typing involves avoiding an insertion order where a smaller character ((sigma(j))) is typed before switching back to type a larger character ((sigma(i))), breaking the desired order.    - **Sufficiency**: To show it is sufficient, type ( B ) inductively character by character. On typing each ( k ) (in the (213)-avoiding pattern), the only potential hindrance is if ( k+1 ) appears afterward but needs to be typed before any intermediate character between ( k ) and ( k+1 ). Since no (213)-pattern exists, this problematic scenario is avoided, ensuring ( B ) is reachable. 4. **Claim**: A permutation ( sigma ) on ({1, ldots, n}) is (213)-avoiding if and only if its inverse ( sigma^{-1} ) is also (213)-avoiding.    *Proof*:    - Suppose (i < j < k) and ( sigma(j) < sigma(i) < sigma(k) ). Denote:      [      i' = sigma(j), quad j' = sigma(i), quad k' = sigma(k)      ]      Then ( i' < j' < k' ), and we observe that:      [      sigma^{-1}(i') = j, quad sigma^{-1}(j') = i, quad sigma^{-1}(k') = k      ]      Under the given conditions:      [      sigma^{-1}(j') < sigma^{-1}(i') < sigma^{-1}(k')      ]      This implies the inverse of the original permutation (sigma) also avoids the (213) pattern, proving the claim. 5. To finalize the proof of the original proposition:    - Suppose ( B ) is reachable from ( A ). Thus, there exists a permutation ( sigma ) on ({1, ldots, n}) such that the (i)-th character of ( A ) is transformed to the ( sigma(i) )-th character of ( B ). Given this permutation is (213)-avoiding, as proven previously.    - By the earlier claim, ( sigma^{-1} ) is also (213)-avoiding, allowing us to establish a sequence of left-arrow key operations to revert from ( B ) back to ( A ). Conclusively, this verifies that ( A ) is reachable from ( B ) if and only if ( B ) is reachable from ( A ). (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Let x, y, z be positive real numbers, satisfying xy+2z=0.

Calculate the total number of sequences (n) by finding the permutations of 5 items taken all at a time, which is P(5, 5) = 5! = 120. 2. Next, we must calculate m, the number of sequences where B and C are not next to A. This scenario involves:     - Positioning A in one of the 5 positions.     - Placing B and C such that they are not adjacent to A.      - Arranging the two remaining players in the remaining spots.     There are two general cases for the position of A:          - **Case 1**: A is at one of the ends. This allows the other two (B and C) to be arranged in only one way without being next to A because if either is next to A, it violates the rule. For the remaining two players (excluding A, B, and C), they could be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Since there are 2 ends where A can be placed, there are 2 times 1 times 2 = 4 possibilities for this case.     - **Case 2**: A is in one of the 3 middle positions. Now, we have to place B and C in the three nonadjacent positions (2 on the ends and 1 in the middle far from A), which can be done in P(3, 2) = 3 times 2 = 6 ways. Then, the remaining two players can be arranged in the two remaining spots in 2 ways. Since there are 3 ways to place A in the middle, this case has 3 times 6 times 2 = 36 possibilities.     The total for m is the sum of the possibilities from both cases: 4 + 36 = 40 possible sequences. 3. Calculate the probability (p) that B and C are not next to A as the ratio of m to n, that is, p = frac{m}{n} = frac{40}{120} = frac{1}{3}. However, since there's a discrepancy in the provided calculation and the options listed, we need to verify the calculations. Case 1 seems to have been miscalculated. When A is at one of the ends, and we want to prevent B and C from being next to A, B and C can be at either the second or the fourth position in two ways. The two remaining spots can be filled in P(3, 2) = 3 times 2 = 6 ways. Hence, Case 1 actually yields 2 times 2 times 6 = 24 possibilities. Adding Case 1 (24 possibilities) to Case 2 (36 possibilities), we get that m = 24 + 36 = 60 possible sequences. Therefore, the corrected probability p is p = frac{60}{120} = frac{1}{2}. Unfortunately, none of the given options (A, B, C, D) match our finding. So, we need to assess our process to ensure accuracy. Upon reviewing, we realize that when A is in a middle position (3 options), we should only consider the immediately adjacent spots for B and C (which would be two spots for either to be placed in). Hence the number of ways to place B and C when A is in the middle should be P(2, 2) = 2! = 2 ways, not 6 as calculated earlier. Recalculating Case 2 gives us: 3 times 2 times 2 = 12 possibilities. Now we add the revised Case 1 and Case 2, giving us m = 24 + 12 = 36 possible sequences.

The longest side is 120 m. 1. **Geometry Explanation**: Each angle of 120^circ is bisected by the crop transportation direction dividing the parallelogram into two equal regions if containing equal areas. 2. **Area Assessment**: Each region closest to a point along the 120 m side would involve half of the parallelogram since the parallelogram is symmetrical along the lines bisecting 120^circ angles. 3. **Calculation of Fraction**: Calculate the area considered. The total area of the parallelogram is (base x height). The height from the side of 80 m with respect to the angle 60^circ will be (80 times sin(60^circ)). Thus, the area = (80 times 120 times sin(60^circ)).  Since we know (sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}): Total area = (80 times 120 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 4800 frac{sqrt{3}}{2}). Now half is taken to the longest side implying:  Fraction to the longest side = (frac{4800 frac{sqrt{3}}{2} / 2}{4800 frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{1}{2}).

Let's break down the operations and explore the implications step-by-step: 1. **Initial Condition**:    - Our goal is to check if we can transform the number 1 to 811 using the allowed operations.     2. **Operations Analysis**:     - **Multiplication by 2**: If we start from 1 and keep multiplying by 2, the number doubles at each step.     - **Permutation of Digits**: After every multiplication, we are allowed to rearrange the digits of the resulting number. 3. **Exploring the Problem**:     - If it were possible to obtain 811 starting from 1 by following these operations, then it should be possible to perform the reverse set of operations to get back from 811 to 1.     - Let's examine the possible reverse operations. 4. **Reverse Operations**:     - **Initial Permutation**: We start with 811. The possible permutations of its digits are:       [       {811, 181, 118}       ]     - **Divide by 2**: Next, we should check if any permutation can be halved (integer division):       - ( 811 div 2 = 405.5 ) (not an integer)       - ( 181 div 2 = 90.5 ) (not an integer)       - ( 118 div 2 = 59 ) (integer, so valid)            - Now, we continue with 59 since 59 is the only valid number obtained by dividing 118 by 2. 5. **Further Permutations and Divisions**:    - The permutations of 59 are:       [       {59, 95}       ]     - **Halving These Numbers**:       - ( 59 div 2 = 29.5 ) (not an integer)       - ( 95 div 2 = 47.5 ) (not an integer)            - Since none of these results in an integer, we can't proceed further via the allowed operations. 6. **Conclusion**:     - We have exhausted all possibilities and found it impossible to go from 811 to 1 using the allowed operations. Therefore, we conclude that it is not possible to transform the number 1 into 811 using multiplication by 2 and permutations of digits. The conclusion is definitive as no valid sequence of allowed operations can achieve this transformation.

First, add the two equations:    [    3x + 4y + 4x + 3y = a^2 + b^2    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    7(x + y) = a^2 + b^2    ]    This implies:    [    a^2 + b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}    ] 3. Next, subtract the second equation from the first:    [    3x + 4y - (4x + 3y) = a^2 - b^2    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    -x + y = a^2 - b^2    ]    This implies:    [    x - y equiv a^2 - b^2 pmod{7}    ] 4.

We need (a^2 + b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}). Let's check the possible pairs ((a^2, b^2)):    - If (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}), then (b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}).    - If (a^2 equiv 1 pmod{7}), then (b^2 equiv 6 pmod{7}), but 6 is not a quadratic residue modulo 7.    - If (a^2 equiv 2 pmod{7}), then (b^2 equiv 5 pmod{7}), but 5 is not a quadratic residue modulo 7.    - If (a^2 equiv 4 pmod{7}), then (b^2 equiv 3 pmod{7}), but 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 7.    Therefore, the only solution is (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}) and (b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}). 6. Since (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}) and (b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}), we have (a equiv 0 pmod{7}) and (b equiv 0 pmod{7}). 7. Substituting (a equiv 0 pmod{7}) and (b equiv 0 pmod{7}) into the equations, we get:    [    3x + 4y equiv 0 pmod{49}    ]    [    4x + 3y equiv 0 pmod{49}    ] 8.

From (7(x + y) equiv 0 pmod{49}), we get (x + y equiv 0 pmod{7}). Since (x - y equiv 0 pmod{7}), we have (x equiv y pmod{7}). 10. Therefore, (x) and (y) must both be divisible by 7.

This results from a straightforward calculation considering the pattern used to color the board, which balances the colors as evenly as possible. 3. **Properties of the Ship:**     Each four-cell ship occupies one cell of each color when placed horizontally or vertically on the board.  4. **Optimal Strategy:**     - To ensure the minimum number of attempts to hit the ship, we should aim at the most frequent color cells on the board:         - Yellow cells are the least in number (24), meaning if a ship must occupy at least one yellow cell, we are bound to hit it in at most 24 strikes. 5. **Proof by Counter Example:**     - Assume fewer than 24 strikes; say (n < 24).     - There are situations where all strikes miss the yellow cells, where striking non-yellow cells (red, green, blue) alone won't guarantee a hit since the ship might occupy only one color cell from each category.      Therefore, ensuring one hit when targeting fewer than 24 yellow cells is not guaranteed. 6. **Conclusion:**     - Therefore, to ensure hitting the four-cell ship on a 10 times 10 board, a minimum of 24 strikes targeting yellow cells suffices.

Let's analyze the rotations involved and derive the necessary conclusions. 1. **Rotations and Intermediate Steps**:    - Observe that the triangles (ABO_1), (BCO_2), (CDO_3), and (DAO_4) are isosceles right triangles, each providing specific rotation characteristics around their respective right angles.    - When (O_1 = O_3), we perform a (180^circ) rotation around (O_3) (or (O_1)) to observe its symmetrical properties.    - The sequential rotations can be represented in composite form as a combination of (90^circ) rotations along the vertices (A), (B), (C), and (D). 2. **Composite Rotation Representation**:    - Consider the rotation operations step by step:      [      R_{A}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{D}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{C}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{B}^{90^{circ}}      ]    - This combined rotation is equivalent to two (180^circ) rotations when (O_1 = O_3):      [      R_{O_3}^{180^{circ}} circ R_{O_1}^{180^{circ}} = E      ]      where (E) represents the identity transformation (no change). 3. **Implication of Identity Representation**:    - Therefore, we must have:      [      E = R_{A}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{A}^{-90^{circ}} circ R_{A}^{180^{circ}} = R_{A}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{D}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{C}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{B}^{90^{circ}}      ]    - Since combining these rotations must result in an identity transformation,       [      R_{A}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{D}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{C}^{90^{circ}} circ R_{B}^{90^{circ}} = R_{O_4}^{180^{circ}} circ R_{O_2}^{180^{circ}}      ] 4. **Conclusion**:    - This equality confirms that the pairs of rotations must be equivalent based on their symmetrical properties around their respective points. Hence, it implies that:      [      O_4 = O_2      ] Thus, we have demonstrated the required relationship under the given conditions: (boxed{O_2 = O_4})"},{"instruction":"f the function f(x) = ax  x^2  ln x has extrema and the sum of these extrema is not less than 4 + ln 2, find the range of values for a.","output":"We need to analyze the monotonicity and extrema of the function f(x), calculate its domain, and then find f'(x). We will use the relationship between the derivative and the extrema to set up conditions: f'(x) = 0 has roots in the interval (0, +infty). Hence, the quadratic equation 2x^2 - ax + 1 = 0 must have roots in the interval (0, +infty). We'll solve the inequality with respect to a to determine its range. Let's find the derivative of f(x):  f'(x) = a - 2x - frac{1}{x} = -frac{2x^2 - ax + 1}{x}  Since the function f(x) has extrema, the equation f'(x) = 0 has roots in the interval (0, +infty). Therefore, the equation 2x^2 - ax + 1 = 0 must have real roots. This implies the discriminant Delta = a^2 - 8 geq 0. However, if Delta = 0, the function f(x) does not have any extrema, which contradicts the problem statement. Thus, we need two distinct positive roots for the quadratic equation. Let the roots of the equation 2x^2 - ax + 1 = 0 be x_1 and x_2. Then we have:  x_1 + x_2 = frac{a}{2}, quad x_1x_2 = frac{1}{2}  The values f(x_1) and f(x_2) are the extrema of the function f(x). According to the problem, their sum is not less than 4 + ln 2:  f(x_1) + f(x_2) = a(x_1+x_2) - (x_1^2 + x_2^2) - (ln x_1 + ln x_2)   = frac{a^2}{2} - frac{a^2}{4} + 1 - ln frac{1}{2} geq 4 + ln 2  Simplifying this inequality gives us a^2 geq 12 and since Delta > 0, we also have a > 0.

Speed in meters per second (m/s) = Speed in kilometers per hour (kmph) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 60 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 16.6666666667 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the distance the train travels while passing the platform using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time The time taken to pass the platform is given as 23.998080153587715 seconds.

It's closer to 2,357 than 2,358, so we'll use 2,357 clerical staff.

Given a regular triangular prism (A B C A_1 B_1 C_1) with height (6) and a sphere (Omega) of radius ( r = sqrt{frac{8}{3}} ), which touches all the lateral faces of the prism, we need to find the volume of the prism and the length of segment (B K).     2. Since the sphere touches all lateral faces of the prism, the circle with the same radius ( r ) can be inscribed in the base triangle (ABC) of the prism. The radius (r) of the inscribed circle in an equilateral triangle is given by ( r = frac{a sqrt{3}}{6} ), where (a) is the side of the triangle. 3. Given ( r = sqrt{frac{8}{3}} ), we can find (a): [ sqrt{frac{8}{3}} = frac{a sqrt{3}}{6} ] [ a sqrt{3} = 6 sqrt{frac{8}{3}} ] [ a = frac{6 sqrt{frac{8}{3}}}{sqrt{3}} = 4 sqrt{2} ] 4.

But 20 is not between 1 and 16, so it is not an applicable value. 3. **Conclusion on neighbors of 16:**    - The only possible neighbor for 16 is 9.    - Since 16 has only one valid neighbor, it must be placed at one end of the line. 4. **Constructing the sequence:**    - Start with 16 and 9: (16 - 9).    - Find the potential neighbors for 9. Perfect squares possible with 9 up to 31 are checked.      - (9 + 7 = 16): valid since 7 is between 1 and 16.      - (9 + 16): already used 16, we move forward.    - Continue sequentially checking and adjoining numbers to form neighboring perfect squares.

However, this is impossible as 9 can only be placed once. Conclusion:  Therefore, it is not possible to place all the numbers 1 to 16 around a circle such that the sum of each pair of neighboring numbers is a perfect square.

How many trees can one logger cut down per day?","output":"First, let's calculate the total number of trees in the forest. The forest is 4 miles by 6 miles, which is an area of 4 * 6 = 24 square miles. Each square mile has 600 trees, so the total number of trees in the forest is 24 * 600 = 14,400 trees. Now, let's calculate the total number of trees cut down by all 8 loggers in 10 months. Since there are 30 days in each month, the total number of days worked by the loggers is 10 * 30 = 300 days. All 8 loggers working together for 300 days cut down all 14,400 trees. So, the total number of trees cut down by all 8 loggers in 300 days is 14,400 trees. Now, let's find out how many trees one logger can cut down per day. Since 8 loggers cut down 14,400 trees in 300 days, we can calculate the number of trees one logger cuts down in one day by dividing the total number of trees by the number of loggers and then by the number of days: Number of trees one logger cuts down per day = 14,400 trees / (8 loggers * 300 days) Number of trees one logger cuts down per day = 14,400 / 2400 Number of trees one logger cuts down per day = 6 trees.

What is the smallest number that Anya must write so that the result is guaranteed to be divisible by 11?","output":"We need to determine the smallest natural number Anya should write so that, after replacing one of its digits with a neighboring digit of 1, the resulting number is guaranteed to be divisible by 11. To solve this, we will use the divisibility rule for 11: a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. An important observation is that if Boris changes a digit by 1, the alternating sum of the digits will change in a specific way, depending on the position of the changed digit. 1. **Anya's number must have an alternating sum related to 11**:    - Let ( S ) be the alternating sum of the digits of Anya's number.    - Boris can replace a digit with a neighboring digit of 1, i.e., he can either increase or decrease a digit by 1.    - If the digit is at an odd position from right, increasing or decreasing this digit by 1 will either add or subtract 1 from ( S ).    - Similarly, if the digit is at an even position, increasing or decreasing this digit by 1 will either subtract or add 1 to ( S ). 2. **Ensuring the result is divisible by 11**:    - This means that if the original alternating sum ( S ) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 11, then the sum will also leave a remainder of 1 or 10 after the change (since remainder 10 is equivalent to -1 mod 11).    - Similarly, if ( S ) leaves a remainder of 10 when divided by 11, any change will leave a remainder of 0 or 9, keeping the sum still divisible by 11. Let's now calculate manually: - Consider the number with the smallest pattern ensuring the alternating sum yields possible valid remainders when changed by 1.    - As example:   - Number: 909090909   - Alternating sum: 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 + 9 = 45 3. **Checking divisibility for the smallest number**:    - Let's verify if this sum meets our requirement.    [ 45 mod 11 = 1 quad text{or} quad 10 ] - Follow similar for higher lengths to find smallest common pattern:   - Number: 9090909090 (another option if more digits needed)   - Alternating sum: 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 + 9 - 0 = 45   [ 45 mod 11 = 1 quad text{or} quad 10   ] Conclusion: Thus, 9 must be alternating in specific positions yielding smallest term for Anya guaranteeing divisibility by 11: [ boxed{909090909} ]"},{"instruction":"f the graph of the function f(x)=sin omega x+sin (omega x frac {pi}{2}) (omega > 0) is symmetric about the point left( frac {pi}{8},0right), and there is a zero point within left( frac {pi}{4},0right), then the minimum value of omega is ____.

Pump C can fill the tank in 5 hours, so its rate is 1/5 of the tank per hour. Leak X can drain the tank in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the tank per hour. Leak Y operates at twice the rate of leak X, so its rate is 2 times 1/8, which is 1/4 of the tank per hour. Now, let's find the combined rate of filling the tank by adding the rates of the pumps and subtracting the rates of the leaks: Combined rate = Rate of A + Rate of B + Rate of C - Rate of X - Rate of Y Combined rate = (1/3) + (1/4) + (1/5) - (1/8) - (1/4) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The smallest common denominator for 3, 4, 5, and 8 is 120.

Decrease = (x/100) * 5500 The new salary after the decrease = Rs. 5500 - Decrease We know the new salary after the decrease is Rs. 5225, so we can set up the equation: 5500 - (x/100) * 5500 = 5225 Now, let's solve for 'x': 5500 - (x/100) * 5500 = 5225 5500 - 55x = 5225 55x = 5500 - 5225 55x = 275 Now, divide both sides by 55 to solve for 'x': x = 275 / 55 x = 5 So, the percentage decrease in the typist's salary after the initial increase was boxed{5%} ."},{"instruction":"Among the following types of reasoning, the one that is deductive reasoning is (　　)   A: For a circle with radius r, the area S=pi r^2, thus for a unit circle the area S=pi   B: From the fact that gold, silver, copper, iron conduct electricity, it is inferred that all metals conduct electricity   C: From the properties of plane triangles, the properties of a spatial tetrahedron are inferred   D: From the equation of a circle in the plane Cartesian coordinate system (xa)^2+(yb)^2=r^2, it is inferred that the equation of a sphere in the spatial Cartesian coordinate system is (xa)^2+(yb)^2+(zc)^2=r^2","output":"**Answer:** For A, according to the syllogism of deductive reasoning, the major premise is that for a circle with radius r, the area S=pi r^2, the minor premise is that a unit circle has a radius of 1, and the conclusion is that the area of a unit circle S=pi.

Some pairs of imons in the lab can be entangled, and each imon can participate in many entanglement relations.

If some imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons in the lab, then the physicist can destroy it. 2. At any moment, he may double the whole family of imons in his lab by creating a copy ( I' ) of each imon ( I ). During this procedure, the two copies ( I' ) and ( J' ) become entangled if and only if the original imons ( I ) and ( J ) are entangled, and each copy ( I' ) becomes entangled with its original imon ( I ). No other entanglements occur or disappear at this moment. Prove that the physicist may apply a sequence of such operations resulting in a family of imons, no two of which are entangled.","output":"1: 1. **Graph Representation of Imons**:     - Let us consider a graph ( G ) where the vertices represent the imons, and an edge between two vertices represents entanglement between the corresponding imons.     2. **Applying Proper Coloring**:     - Recall that a proper coloring of a graph ( G ) is a coloring of its vertices such that any two adjacent vertices have different colors.     3. **Lemma and Proof**:     - **Lemma**: Suppose a graph ( G ) can be properly colored using ( n ) different colors (( n > 1 )). Then it is possible to perform a sequence of operations leading to a graph that can be properly colored using ( n-1 ) colors.     - **Proof**:         - Apply operation (i) (destroy an imon entangled with an odd number of imons) as much as possible. Since the number of vertices is decreasing, we eventually get a graph where all vertices have even degree.                  - This graph can still be properly colored using ( n ) colors. Let's fix this proper coloring.                  - Next, we apply operation (ii) (doubling the imons). In the resulting graph, original vertices keep their colors, and new vertices ( I' ) get color ( (k+1) mod n ), where ( k ) is the color of the original imon ( I ).                  - In the new graph, the degree of each vertex is odd since they connect to their respective double. So, operation (i) can be used to remove vertices of color ( n ). Since no two such vertices are connected, their degrees remain the same until they are removed.                  - Therefore, the graph now can be properly colored using ( n-1 ) colors as needed.              - This proves our lemma. 4. **General Application**:     - Starting with a graph with ( n ) vertices, it can be properly colored with ( n ) different colors.     - By repeatedly applying the lemma, we reduce the number of necessary colors one by one, eventually reaching a state where only 1 color is needed.     - A graph that can be properly colored using one color means it has no edges, thus no entanglements between imons.      5. **Conclusion**:     - The physicist may apply these operations to achieve a state where no two imons are entangled.   Hence, using induction on the number of colors in proper coloring and applying our lemma, the physicist can transform any initial graph of imons to one with no edges. [ boxed{} ]  2: 1. **Using Graph Language**:     - We again model the imons and their entanglements using a graph ( G ) where vertices represent imons and edges represent entanglements. 2. **Initial Observation**:     - **Lemma**: Suppose a graph ( G ) has an isolated vertex ( A ). Let ( G^circ ) be the graph obtained by removing ( A ). If ( G^circ ) can be reduced to a graph with no edges through a sequence of operations, the same is true for ( G ).     - **Proof**:         - Any operation applicable to ( G^circ ) can correspondingly be applied to ( G ). If the operation is type (i), it is directly repeatable in ( G ).         - If type (ii), apply it to ( G ) and remove the duplicate of ( A ). 3. **Handling Isolated Vertices**:     - If at some point a graph contains an isolated vertex, we can delete it using an operation (iii). 4. **Handling Graph ( G_n^m )**:     - Suppose we start with a graph ( G ) with vertices ( V = {A_1^0, ldots, A_n^0} ). After applying operations, if operation (ii) is applied ( m ) times, the resultant graph ( G_n^m ) has vertices ( V_n^m = { A_i^j : 1 leq i leq n, 0 leq j leq 2^m - 1 } ).     - Here, ( A_i^0 ) is the “ancestor” of all vertices ( A_i^j ). 5. **Subgraph ( G_n^m )**:     - Vertices ( A_i^j ) and ( A_k^ell ) are connected if:       1. ( j = ell ) and there was an edge between ( A_i^0 ) and ( A_k^0 ).       2. ( i = k ) and binary expansions of ( j ) and ( ell ) differ in exactly one digit.      6. **Induction Proof**:     - By induction on ( n ):         - **Base Case**: For ( n = 0 ), the result is trivial.                  - **Induction Step**:           - Apply operations to ensure all vertices have even degrees.           - Apply operation (ii) to make all degrees odd, then delete vertices systematically, maintaining odd degrees as needed.           - Finally, if any remaining vertex ( A_n^j ) (with an odd sum of binary digits), we proceed to delete it if degrees indicate.          - The process described eliminates all vertices of the form ( A_n^j ), reducing the problem to ( G_{n-1}^{m+1} ), for which the induction hypothesis completes the proof. 7. **Conclusion**:     - Repeatedly applying steps allows reducing any initial graph ( G ) to a state with no edges, ensuring no entanglements.

The Sine Rule states:        [    frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin beta} = frac{c}{sin gamma}    ]    However, this relationship does not directly include the given angle gamma. To address this, we can use the relationship between alpha, beta, and gamma due to the angle sum property of a triangle. 3. Recall that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180^circ:    [    alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ    ]    Thus, we can express alpha in terms of beta and gamma as:        [    alpha = 180^circ - beta - gamma    ] 4. Next, we use the Sine function transformation for complementary angles. Since sin(180^circ - x) = sin(x), it follows that:    [    sin(alpha) = sin(180^circ - beta - gamma) = sin(beta + gamma)    ] 5. Using the angle addition formula for sine, we can expand sin(beta + gamma):    [    sin(beta + gamma) = sin(beta)cos(gamma) + cos(beta)sin(gamma)    ] 6. Substitute this back into the Sine Rule:    [    frac{a}{b} = frac{sin(beta + gamma)}{sin(beta)}    ]    which becomes:    [    frac{a}{b} = frac{sin(beta)cos(gamma) + cos(beta)sin(gamma)}{sin(beta)}    ] 7. By dividing the numerator by sin(beta), we get:    [    frac{a}{b} = cos(gamma) + cot(beta) sin(gamma)    ] 8. Solving for cot(beta):    [    frac{a}{b} - cos(gamma) = cot(beta) sin(gamma)    ]    Dividing both sides by sin(gamma), we find:    [    cot(beta) = frac{frac{a}{b} - cos(gamma)}{sin(gamma)}    ]    Alternatively:    [    cot(beta) = frac{a}{b sin(gamma)} - cot(gamma)    ] 9.

The transformation s to frac{-1+isqrt{3}}{2} cdot s indicates omega = e^{2pi i / 3}, and the condition s^2 being a root suggests a further non-trivial cyclic relationship. 2. **Analyze Roots**:     The roots form groups via both s, somega, somega^2 and also include s^2. This results in potentially overlapping cyclical relationships, requiring careful alignment with a seventh-degree polynomial. 3. **Possible Roots Configuration**:    We can consider similar configurations as before,    - s, somega, somega^2, s^2, (s^2)omega, (s^2)omega^2 are six roots.    A seventh root, t, must be real as it stands alone or coincides with one of the previous roots due to polynomial degree constraints. 4. **Configuring the Polynomial**:    If we define polynomial as prod_{text{all roots}} (x - text{root}) ensuring all coefficients are real by balancing complex conjugates, potential forms of Q(x) can typically revolve around these root configurations. 5. **Counting Unique Polynomials**:    Considering different variations of such root groupings, we see that each unique configuration corresponds to a distinct polynomial. However, this is heavily dependent on the real root t being possibly a repeated real root from the set s, s^2. 6. **Conclusion**:    Since certain roots impose constraints while others provide freedom (the isolated real root), only a limited number of forms can exist. Specifying this without definitive coefficients is challenging but probably results in a few unique forms, precisely two like the original problem suggestion.
