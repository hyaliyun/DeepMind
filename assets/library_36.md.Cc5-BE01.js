According to a study published in the journal Nature Communications, a new therapy has been developed that could potentially reverse the damage done by Alzheimer's in the brain. The treatment involves using a compound called EGCG, which is found in green tea. The researchers found that EGCG can bind to beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, which are thought to cause the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. This binding process helps to break down the plaques and reduce the inflammation and oxidative stress that they cause. In mice with Alzheimer's disease, the researchers found that the EGCG treatment led to a significant decrease in plaque levels and an improvement in cognitive function. The researchers hope that the treatment could eventually be used in humans to prevent or reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people worldwide, and there is currently no cure for the condition. The development of this new treatment is therefore highly significant, and could potentially bring hope to many individuals and families affected by the disease. Further research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the EGCG treatment in humans, but the findings of this study are certainly promising. It is hoped that this research will inspire further investigation into the use of natural compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."},{"instruction":"Do the questions What are the benefits of drinking green tea? and Why should I drink green tea? ask the same thing?","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking for the advantages or reasons for drinking green tea."},{"instruction":"The car engine made a loud clunking noise.

The earthquake, which occurred at 5:30 pm local time, was centered in a nearby fault line and lasted for about a minute. It was followed by multiple aftershocks, some of them strong enough to knock down weakened structures. The immediate aftermath of the earthquake was chaotic and confusing. Emergency sirens blared as firefighters, paramedics, and police officers rushed to the affected areas, trying to rescue trapped people and prevent further damage. The streets were filled with debris, dust, and smoke, hindering visibility and mobility. Many roads and bridges were cracked or collapsed, making transportation difficult. Power lines and water pipes were disrupted, leaving some areas without electricity and clean water. According to the latest reports from the local authorities, the earthquake has caused at least 200 deaths and 1000 injuries. These numbers are expected to rise as search and rescue operations continue. The casualties include people who were crushed by falling buildings, hit by flying objects, or trapped under rubble. Some of them were inside schools, hospitals, markets, or offices that collapsed or caught fire. Others were outside, trying to flee from the shaking, but were caught in the stampede or exposed to hazards. The earthquake has also left many people homeless and traumatized. Thousands of families have lost their houses or apartments, forcing them to sleep in makeshift shelters or open spaces. Many others are still looking for their loved ones, hoping that they survived or were rescued. The psychological impact of the earthquake is expected to be severe, as many people are experiencing fear, anxiety, and despair. The local and national governments have declared a state of emergency and mobilized resources to respond to the crisis. The army has been deployed to help with the rescue efforts and maintain public order. International aid and rescue teams are also on the way. However, the magnitude and complexity of the disaster pose a challenge to the relief operations, as many areas are inaccessible or dangerous. The earthquake has reminded us once again of the vulnerability of cities and the importance of preparedness and resilience. Although earthquakes cannot be predicted or prevented, their impact can be reduced through measures such as building codes, early warning systems, and community awareness. The city and the country will need not only to recover from the immediate effects of the earthquake but also to reflect on the lessons learned and the actions needed to prevent future disasters."},{"instruction":"Combine facts and answer this: Who invented the telephone and founded Bell Telephone Company, which later became AT&T?","output":"Alexander Graham Bell."},{"instruction":"Text: Number theory Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integervalued functions.

According to the World Health Organization, chronic diseases account for 60% of all deaths worldwide, making them the leading cause of death. The key to reducing the number of fatalities is to improve the management of chronic illnesses, and technology appears to be an excellent solution. One of the remarkable ways technology is transforming healthcare is through telemedicine, which enables medical professionals to treat patients remotely using modern communication tools. Telemedicine makes it possible for patients with chronic illnesses to access high-quality medical services from the comfort of their homes. This method of treatment not only reduces hospital visits but also saves patients the stress and cost that comes with traveling long distances for treatment. Another breakthrough technology that could revolutionize care for patients with chronic illnesses is wearable health technology. Devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers enable the tracking of vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in real-time. These devices can be used to monitor the condition of patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, thus enabling the timely detection of problems and prompt medical intervention. Artificial intelligence (AI) is yet another promising technology that has the potential to transform healthcare for people with chronic illnesses. AI can be used to analyze large datasets collected by wearable devices to identify patterns that can be used to predict the onset or exacerbation of medical conditions. This early detection can lead to early interventions, potentially preventing complications or even life-threatening situations. In conclusion, the adoption of technology in healthcare presents hope for people living with chronic illnesses. The technology discussed here, ranging from telemedicine to wearable devices to AI, has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospital visits and costs, and extend lives. As we continue to make strides in medical technology, we are optimistic that we will see more solutions that address the unique needs of patients with chronic illnesses."},{"instruction":"wasn't every day that a cheerful, lonelylooking girl kept trying to make conversation with you at the bus stop.

Ancak, bu tür bir sistem etik, pratik ve felsefi birçok soru ve meydan okumayı da beraberinde getirir. Önerilen model, bireylerin yaşamları üzerinde devlet ya da bir küresel otoritenin aşırı derecede kontrol sahibi olması fikrine dayanmaktadır. Bu, pek çok demokratik ve özgürlükçü ilkeyle çelişir. Ayrıca, \\"en güçlü genlerin\\" seçilmesi kavramı etik olarak büyük sorunlar yaratır ve tarihte eugenics (ırk ıslahı) hareketleriyle benzerlikler gösterir. Bu hareketler, insanlık tarihinde bazı karanlık dönemlere yol açmıştır. 1. **Genetik Seçim:** En güçlü genlerin yapay olarak seçilmesi, genetik çeşitliliği azaltabilir ve uzun vadede insan popülasyonunun belirli hastalıklara karşı savunmasız hale gelmesine neden olabilir. Ayrıca, kimin \\"en güçlü\\" ya da \\"yeterli\\" olduğuna karar vermek, subjektif ve potansiyel olarak tehlikeli bir süreçtir. 2. **Aşk Yuvaları ve Gebelik:** Bu konsept, insan ilişkilerini ve üreme süreçlerini büyük ölçüde düzenleyen bir yaklaşımı temsil eder. Bu tür bir düzenleme, kişisel özgürlüğe ve seçimlere ciddi sınırlamalar getirir. 3. **Bebeklerin Toplumsal Mülkiyeti:** Bebeklerin biyolojik ebeveynlerinden alınarak \\"insanlık ailesine\\" dahil edilmesi, aile bağlarının önemini ve bireyin kendi kökenine olan bağlılığını küçümser. Bu, bireysel kimlik ve aidiyet duygusunu zedeleyebilir. 4. **Eşit Yetenek Testleri:** Her alanda adil yetenek testleri yapılması fikri, bireylerin eşit fırsatlara sahip olması ve yeteneklerinin tam potansiyelini gerçekleştirebilmesi açısından cazip görünse de, bu testlerin gerçekten objektif ve adil olup olmadığı sorusu ortaya çıkar. Bu tür bir sistemde, bireysel çeşitlilik ve farklılıkların değerinin azaltılma riski vardır. 5. **Eğitim ve Gelişim:** Bebek havuzundaki her bireyin bütün yeteneklerini ortaya çıkarabilmesi için tasarlanmış bir eğitim sistemi, teorik olarak bireysel yeteneklerin en iyi şekilde geliştirilmesine yardımcı olabilir. Ancak, bu sistemin uygulanması, tüm bireylerin farklılıklarını ve benzersiz ihtiyaçlarını dikkate alması gerekecektir. Sonuç olarak, bu tür bir medeniyet inşası, insan hakları, bireysel özgürlükler ve etik değerler açısından önemli sorunlar ve zorluklar barındırır. Herkes için fırsat eşitliği sağlama hedefi takdir edilse de, amaçlara ulaşmak için kullanılan yöntemler ve araçlar tartışmaya açıktır. Bu, daha geniş bir etik, felsefi ve politik diyalog gerektiren karmaşık bir konudur."},{"instruction":"aslında yukarıdaki ilke aşağıdaki şiirin merkez ve omurgasıdır: şimdi de ilk soru ve cevabı da dikkate alarak bir bütün olarak bu şiirin tamamını bir insanlık projesi olarak analiz et: bu satırlardaki ilkelerle nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edebiliriz: öleceksiniz, demiş tanrı: ölmeden mezarlara mı girelim? her an'ımızı korkuyla mı geçirelim? hayır, biz ölümsüzlüğü arayacağız atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde hayır, biz hayatın tadına varacağız kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde gün doğumunda ve gün batımında hayranlık içinde seyredeceğiz doğayı şarkılar söyleyip dans edeceğiz çırılçıplak, ne utanma ne çekince engellilerin yüzlerine öpücükler konduracak güzeller yakışıklılar salıncaklarda sallayacak neşeli çocuklar sarhoş şairleri cenneti büyütüp cehennemi küçülteceğiz bu evrende aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği öyle ki gerçekleştirsinler özgürce kendilerini olimpiyat ruhu kuşatmalı her alandaki rekabeti ödül de ceza da adalet de ölümden önce gelmeli tanrının boyunduruğunda sonsuz bir hayat değil tanrısız tek bir nefes isteriz, desin insanlık.","output":"Bu şiir ve ona dayanan ilke, insanlık için idealize edilmiş bir medeniyeti tasavvur eder. Merkezinde özgürlük, eşitlik, adalet, bireysel gelişim ve insanlığın genel refahı yatan bir vizyondur. Şiirden hareketle inşa edilebilecek medeniyetin temel yapı taşları aşağıdaki gibi olabilir: 1. **Özgür Bir Toplum:** Şiir, insanların özgürce yaşadığı, korku ve endişeden arınmış bir toplum özlemini dile getiriyor. Ölümsüzlüğü, metaforik anlamda, atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde aramak, insanlığın bilim ve keşif yoluyla sınırlarını zorlaması gerektiğini vurgular. Bu, sadece fiziksel ve keşfedici bilimlerde değil, felsefe, sanat ve edebiyatta da geçerlidir. Kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde hayatın tadına varmak, yaşamın her yönünü kucaklamak anlamına gelir. 2. **Doğa ve Sanatla Uyum:** Doğaya hayranlıkla bakmak ve müzik, dans gibi sanatsal ifade biçimlerini serbestçe kullanmak, bu medeniyetin estetik ve doğa ile barışık olduğunu gösterir. İnsanların doğal dünyayı ve sanatın değişik biçimlerini takdir etme kapasiteleri, toplumun ruh sağlığını ve genel mutluluğunu artırır. 3. **Toplumsal Eşitlik ve Destek:** Engellilere ve toplumun diğer üyelerine gösterilen sevgi ve saygı, bu medeniyetin birlik ve dayanışma anlayışını simgeler. Böylesi bir dünya, bireylerin birbirlerini desteklediği, kimsenin fiziksel ya da zihinsel durumu nedeniyle dışlanmadığı veya ayrımcılığa uğramadığı bir toplumda yaşamayı hayal eder. 4. **Fırsat Eşitliği:** Şiir, \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" ilkesini öne sürerek, tüm bireylerin eşit başlangıç koşullarına sahip olduğu bir toplumu savunur. Bu, eğitim, sağlık hizmetleri ve diğer yaşamsal kaynaklara adil erişimi içerir. Böyle bir medeniyet, her bir bireyin potansiyelini en üst düzeye çıkarmayı amaçlar. 5. **Hakça Yarışma ve Adalet:** Olimpiyat ruhunun her alandaki rekabeti kuşatmasının istenmesi, yarışmanın adil ve dürüst olması gerektiğini vurgular. Ödül, ceza ve adaletin, ölümden önce ve hayatın içinde somut ve adil bir şekilde uygulanması gerektiğini belirtir. 6. **Maddi ve Manevi Bağımsızlık:** Şiir, \\"tanrısız tek bir nefes isteriz\\" diyerek, bireylerin manevi ve maddi bağımsızlık içinde yaşamaları gerektiğini savunur. Bu, insanların bir yüksek güçten korku ve umutla değil, kendi kararları ve ahlaki değerleriyle yaşaması gerektiğini öne sürer. Bu şiirin önerdiği medeniyet, insan onurunu ve bireyselliği korurken, toplumsal eşitliği, adaleti ve desteği merkeze alır. Bu, bireysel özgürlüklerle toplumsal sorumluluk arasında dengeli bir ilişki kurmayı hedefleyen, hem derinlikli hem de kapsayıcı bir insanlık projesidir."},{"instruction":"How can I fix this: Error: unable to connect to Podman socket: failed to connect: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:49813: connect: connection refused","output":"This error occurs when the Podman socket is unable to establish a connection on the specified IP address and port.

Specifically, in Python, parameters with default values (e.g., \`threshold=75\`) must be defined after parameters without default values. In your function, \`entity_name\` and \`section\` are defined after \`threshold=75\`, which causes the syntax error. To fix the error, change the function signature of \`process_single_token_entity\` by moving parameters without default values to the front, like so: \`\`\`python def process_single_token_entity(self, dataframe, entity, entity_name, section, threshold=75): \`\`\` This adjustment ensures that parameters with default values come after those without, adhering to Python's requirements for function definitions. Additionally, during the refactoring, ensure to update any calls to this function to match the new signature. Given your code structure, it appears that \`process_single_token_entity\` is being called within \`process_data\` for both \\"normal\\" sections and \\"special\\" sections, as well as potentially elsewhere in your code or future code. Each of these calls must be updated to use the correct order of arguments. After making this change in the function signature and adjusting function calls accordingly, your code should be syntactically correct and not throw the SyntaxError related to parameter order in function definitions."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical sewing block for making a sleeved leotard. What measurments are needed?","output":"Creating a sleeved leotard involves quite a few measurements to ensure a good fit, especially if designing from scratch. Here is a comprehensive list of measurements you might need for drafting a pattern for a sleeved leotard. Remember, accuracy is key when taking these measurements. 1. **Bust/Chest**: Measure around the fullest part of the chest, keeping the measuring tape under the arms and around the shoulder blades. 2. **Waist**: Measure around the natural waistline, which is the narrowest part of the torso, usually about an inch above the belly button. 3. **Hips**: Measure around the widest part of the hips and buttocks. 4. **Girth/Torso**: This is a critical measurement for leotards. Measure from the shoulder, down through the legs, and back up to the same shoulder, drawing the tape measure snugly against the body to ensure a good fit. 5. **Upper Bust**: Measure directly under the arms, around the body, and above the bust. 6. **Under Bust**: Measure around the body, just under the bust. 7. **Sleeve Length**: Measure from the shoulder edge, through the slightly bent elbow, to the wrist or desired length of the sleeve. 8. **Armhole Depth**: This can be determined by measuring from the top outside edge of the shoulder down to the underarm. 9. **Bicep**: Measure around the fullest part of the bicep with the arm slightly bent. 10. **Wrist**: Measure around the wrist for the sleeve's end, if applicable (for tight-fitting sleeves). 11. **Shoulder to Shoulder**: Measure across the back from one shoulder to the other. 12. **Back Waist Length**: Measure from the most prominent bone at the base of the neck down to the natural waistline. 13. **Front Waist Length**: Measure from the shoulder at the base of the neck, over the fullest part of the bust, to the waistline. 14. **Arm Length (for set-in sleeves)**: Measure from the top of the shoulder, over a slightly bent elbow, to where you want the sleeve to end. 15. **Front Neck to Waist**: Measure from the base of the neck in front, down to the waistline. Taking all these measurements carefully will help you create a leotard pattern that fits the body precisely. Depending on the style of the leotard (e.g., if it has a low scoop back, high neck, etc.), you might need to adjust where you take some of these measurements or take additional ones to ensure complete coverage and comfort. Always perform a fit test with a mock-up before constructing the final garment to allow for any necessary adjustments."},{"instruction":"Draft a pattern for front buttoned shirt, wasting as little material as possible...","output":"Drafting a pattern for a front-buttoned shirt while minimizing fabric waste requires careful planning and efficient use of fabric. The process outlined here is a simplified guide meant to help you create a basic shirt pattern. This guide assumes you have some knowledge about pattern making and sewing. For a more efficient use of fabric, consider using a fabric width that matches well with the total width of your pattern pieces, typically 45 inches (114.3 cm) or 60 inches (152.4 cm). # Tools and Materials Needed: - Measuring Tape - Pattern Paper (or any large paper) - Pencil - Ruler (preferably a clear one) - French curve (helpful for armholes and collars) - Scissors - Fabric (yardage will depend on the shirt size and width of the fabric) # Basic Measurements Needed: 1. **Chest/Bust**: Around the fullest part. 2. **Waist**: At the narrowest point. 3. **Hip**: Around the widest point of the hips. 4. **Shoulder Width**: From one shoulder's edge to the other. 5. **Sleeve Length**: From the shoulder edge to the desired end point at the wrist, or shorter for different styles. 6. **Shirt Length**: From the highest shoulder point (HSP) down to the desired bottom edge of the shirt. 7. **Neck Circumference**: Around the base of the neck. # Drafting the Pattern: **Front and Back (Same Pattern, Altered for Front Opening and Neckline):** 1. **Start with the Back**: Draw a rectangle using the chest/bust measurement for the width (divide the measurement by 4 and add ease and seam allowances) and the shirt length for the height. Adjust the width at the waist and hip if necessary for a better fit, adding 1-2 inches of ease and seam allowances. 2. **Shoulder Slope**: From the top corner, measure down the shoulder length and draw the shoulder line sloping downwards towards the neck. 3. **Neckline**: Back neckline can be a simple curve. For the front piece, adjust the pattern by lowering the front neckline based on your design (establish a center front line and make it a button placket). 4. **Armhole**: Draw the armhole curve using the shoulder point as a guide. A French curve is helpful here. 5. **Side Seams**: Shape the side seams if necessary, tapering in at the waist and back out at the hips. **Sleeves:** 6. **Draft the Sleeve**: The sleeve length plus cap height determines the sleeve length. Use the armhole depth to draw the cap of the sleeve. **Collar and Cuff (If Applicable):** 7. **Collar**: The neck circumference measurement will guide the length of the collar. Draft a simple collar pattern. The collar can be a standard point, spread, or button-down, depending on the style. 8. **Cuff**: Measure the wrist and draft a rectangle that will wrap around it, add plackets. **Minimizing Fabric Waste:** - **Lay Out All Pieces Tightly**: Arrange all pieces in close proximity on your paper first to see how they can be nested before cutting on fabric. - **Use Length Wisely**: Position larger patterns along the fabric's length and slot smaller pieces like cuffs and collars in between or along the edges. - **Consider Sleeve and Torso Length**: Adjust pattern pieces to fit across the fabric width if using a standard fabric width, to minimize offcuts. **Assembly Tips:** - Construct a muslin or test garment to adjust the fit before cutting your final fabric. - Mark all notches, grainlines, and buttonholes on your pattern for easier assembly. # Final Note: This guide gives a very basic outline for drafting a front-buttoned shirt pattern. Many variations in button plackets, collar styles, and fitting adjustments are possible based on personal preference and body shape. Pattern making and garment construction books can provide more detailed instructions and variations. Also, practicing and experimenting with scrap fabric before committing to your final fabric can save materials and help refine your skills."},{"instruction":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: \\"Hey, [player]?

Dependendo do método escolhido para selecionar essa parte, a amostragem pode ser classificada em duas grandes categorias: probabilística e não probabilística. # Amostragem Probabilística A amostragem probabilística é caracterizada pelo fato de cada membro da população ter uma chance conhecida e diferente de zero de ser selecionado para a amostra. Isso implica que a seleção é baseada em elementos aleatórios, garantindo, teoricamente, a representatividade da amostra. Alguns métodos comuns de amostragem probabilística incluem: - **Amostragem Aleatória Simples**: cada membro da população tem a mesma chance de ser escolhido. Pode ser feita com reposição (o elemento volta à população e pode ser escolhido novamente) ou sem reposição (uma vez escolhido, não retorna à população). - **Amostragem Sistemática**: após ordenar a população, seleciona-se um elemento a cada 'k' intervalos. Por exemplo, em uma população de 1000 elementos, deseja-se uma amostra de 100; então, escolhe-se um elemento aleatório entre 1 e 10 e, a partir dele, a cada 10 elementos, outro é selecionado. - **Amostragem Estratificada**: a população é dividida em subgrupos (estratos) que são homogêneos internamente, mas heterogêneos entre si, e a seleção dos elementos é feita aleatoriamente dentro de cada estrato. Essa divisão pode ser feita com base em características como idade, sexo, região geográfica, etc. - **Amostragem por Conglomerados**: ao contrário da estratificada, aqui a população é dividida em grupos heterogêneos internamente, mas semelhantes entre si. A amostra é obtida pela escolha aleatória de um ou mais desses grupos, chamados de conglomerados, e investigando todos os membros dentro deles. # Amostragem Não Probabilística Na amostragem não probabilística, a seleção dos elementos da amostra não se baseia em uma probabilidade conhecida ou igual para todos os membros da população, muitas vezes envolvendo algum grau de subjetividade. Alguns dos métodos não probabilísticos incluem: - **Amostragem por Conveniência**: escolhe-se elementos para a amostra porque são fáceis de acessar ou voluntários. - **Amostragem por Julgamento**: a seleção é feita com base no conhecimento prévio do pesquisador sobre a população, escolhendo-se os casos que ele considera mais representativos ou informativos. - **Amostragem por Cotas**: semelhante à amostragem estratificada, mas a seleção dentro de cada estrato não é feita aleatoriamente. Em vez disso, o pesquisador preenche cotas com base em critérios específicos. - **Amostragem de Bola de Neve**: usada principalmente quando a população de estudo é difícil de acessar. Uma vez que alguns membros são identificados, eles ajudam a recrutar mais participantes dentre seus contatos. # Considerações A escolha entre amostragem probabilística e não probabilística tem implicações importantes quanto à validade e generalização dos resultados. A amostragem probabilística é geralmente preferida para pesquisas quantitativas, pois permite estimativas mais precisas e a aplicação de inferências estatísticas. No entanto, em contextos onde a população é difícil de ser definida ou acessada, ou quando o objetivo é exploratório, a amostragem não probabilística pode ser mais prática ou adequada. É vital que pesquisadores tenham claro o método de amostragem escolhido, suas limitações e implicações para os resultados e conclusões de seus estudos."},{"instruction":"всё ли я верно понял и написал? речь идёт о принципах solid *S* (\`single responsibility principle\`) 1 сущность выполняет 1 действие (чтобы не перенагружать код, быть способным к расширению).

Противоположностью для этого будет антипаттерн *GodObject*, когда одна сущность будет держать на себе слишком много разных задач. *O* (\`Open-closed principle\`) Модули и функции должны быть открыты для расширения но закрыты для изменения. В случае изменения кода нужно делать регрессионное тестирование (убеждаться что мы не сломали существующий код). Изменять функционал рекомендуется добавлять посредством добавления новых функций, а не исправляя старые. *L* (\`Liskov Substitution principle\`) Сущности, использующие родительский тип должны точно также работать и с дочерними классами. Если у нас есть класс *Person*, от которого наследуется *Developer*, то если есть функция, которая сработает с классом *Person*, то она должна точно также сработать и с классом *Developer* I (\`Interface segregation principle\`) Клиенты не должны зависеть от методов, которые они не используют. Так в примере ниже если бы у нас был *knife*, то он бы в случае неправильного использования данного принципа имел бы зависимость от *reload* Принцип разделения интерфейса. Вместо того чтобы пихать всё в один интерфейс лучше максимально декомпозировать сущности. Так, например, если у нас есть интерфейс *weapon* и у него есть методы *attack* и *reload*, то лучше создать интерфейс *attacker* и *reloader*, к которым будут имплементироваться оружия D (\`Dependency inversion principle\`) *Модули верхних уровней* не должны зависеть от *модулей нижних уровней*. А оба из них должны зависеть от [[Интерфейсы и абстрактные классы|абстракций]]. А [[Интерфейсы и абстрактные классы|абстракции]] не должны зависеть от *деталей*. В качестве примера возьмём ситуацию, когда на заводе внутри станка сломалась какая-то деталь. Заменив эту деталь теперь работником требуется переучиваться, а также возможно регулировать подачу электропитания. Если руководствоваться данным нам принципом, то лучше создать абстракции в виде трансформатора и пульта управления. Тогда трансформатор покроет издержки электропитания, а работников не надо будет переучивать, нужно будет лишь настроить пульт управления на новую деталь","output":"В целом, вы верно описали принципы SOLID, однако есть несколько моментов, которые стоит уточнить или дополнить для большей точности: # S (Single Responsibility Principle) - Ваше определение понятия \\"1 сущность выполняет 1 действие\\" стоит уточнить. Принцип одной ответственности гласит, что класс должен иметь одну и только одну причину для изменения. Это не всегда сводится к одному действию, а скорее к одной области ответственности. Например, класс \`UserManager\` может иметь методы для добавления, удаления и поиска пользователя, и всё это будет в рамках одной ответственности - управления пользователями. - Также деление на модель и поведение - это не всегда чёткое следование SRP. Модели могут иметь методы, действующие непосредственно в контексте данных модели, и это тоже может быть в рамках SRP. # O (Open-Closed Principle) - В вашем описании этого принципа всё верно. Важно понимать, что расширение функциональности должно происходить без изменения существующего кода, чтобы не нарушать работу текущих систем. # L (Liskov Substitution Principle) - Ваше объяснение верно. Важно, чтобы подклассы могли служить заменой своим базовым классам без изменения правильности программы. # I (Interface Segregation Principle) - Принцип разделения интерфейса хорошо объяснён. Действительно, системы лучше строить с использованием узконаправленных интерфейсов, чем с одним \\"тяжёлым\\", содержащим слишком много несвязанных методов. # D (Dependency Inversion Principle) - Здесь также всё верно описано. Важно отметить, что основная идея – это снижение зависимости высокоуровневых модулей от низкоуровневых реализаций через абстракции. Это позволяет сделать систему более гибкой и упрощает её модификацию. Общее замечание: ваши объяснения сосредотачиваются на основных идеях, что является правильным подходом для введения в принципы SOLID. однако, в некоторых местах возможны уточнения или небольшие корректировки формулировок для более точного отражения сути принципов."},{"instruction":"Hi chat, a quick question...

Would that be helpful or rather distracting at first? Would there be benefits learning to use a different OS? Would that further his career or hinder it?","output":"Whether an average Joe should consider changing to a different operating system when learning coding depends on several factors, including their goals, interests, and level of comfort with technology. Here are some considerations to keep in mind: 1. **Familiarity vs. Learning Curve**: If an individual is already comfortable using their current operating system (e.g., Windows or macOS) and has access to the necessary development tools and resources, they may not need to switch to a different OS to start learning coding. Switching to a new OS could introduce a learning curve and potentially be distracting initially. 2. **Compatibility and Availability of Tools**: Different operating systems have their own set of development tools, libraries, and environments that are commonly used by developers. For example, many developers use macOS or Linux for web development, while Windows is often used for .NET development. It's important to consider the compatibility and availability of the tools required for the specific coding languages or projects the individual is interested in. 3. **Exposure to Different Environments**: Learning to code on a different operating system can provide exposure to new tools, workflows, and development environments. This can broaden the individual's skillset and understanding of different technologies, which can be beneficial for their career in the long run. 4. **Career Impact**: For some career paths or industries, familiarity with multiple operating systems and development environments can be an asset. Being proficient in Linux, for example, is valuable for roles in system administration, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. However, for most programming roles, the choice of operating system is less important than mastering coding fundamentals and problem-solving skills. In summary, while learning to code on a different operating system can offer benefits such as exposure to new technologies and development workflows, it's not always necessary and may initially be more distracting than helpful for beginners.

Pour une approche plus avancée et dynamique, envisagez d'utiliser \`@HostBinding\` ou NgClass avec des conditions. **Alerte Component** Pour le composant d’alerte, vous pourriez créer un composant qui affiche un message avec divers états (succès, avertissement, erreur, etc.). 1. **Composant HTML (Exemple succinct)** : \`\`\`html <!-- src/app/alerte/alerte.component.html --> <div [ngClass]=\\"\`bg-{type}-100 border-l-4 border-{type}-500 text-{type}-700 p-4\`\\" role=\\"alert\\"> <p class=\\"font-bold\\">Attention</p> <p>{{ message }}</p> </div> \`\`\` 2. **Inputs du Composant** : \`\`\`typescript // src/app/alerte/alerte.component.ts @Input() message: string = 'Ceci est un message d'alerte !'; @Input() type: 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger' = 'success'; \`\`\` **Accordeon Component** L’implémentation de l’accordéon sera un petit peu plus complexe, car vous devrez gérer l’état d’ouverture/fermeture des différents panneaux. 1. **Accordeon HTML** (Exemple basique) : \`\`\`html <!-- src/app/accordeon/accordeon.component.html --> <div class=\\"p-2\\" *ngFor=\\"let item of items\\"> <button class=\\"bg-gray-300 p-2 w-full text-left\\" (click)=\\"toggle(item.id)\\"> {{ item.title }} </button> <div *ngIf=\\"isOpen(item.id)\\" class=\\"p-2 bg-gray-200\\"> {{ item.content }} </div> </div> \`\`\` 2. **Gestion de l'état dans le Composant** : \`\`\`typescript // src/app/accordeon/accordeon.component.ts export class AccordeonComponent { items = [ { id: 1, title: 'Titre 1', content: 'Contenu caché 1' }, // Ajoutez plus d'items ici ]; openItemId: number | null = null; toggle(itemId: number) { this.openItemId = this.openItemId === itemId ? null : itemId; } isOpen(itemId: number) { return this.openItemId === itemId; } } \`\`\` # Étape 5: Ajouter des stories à Storybook (Complément) Pour chaque composant créé : Pour ajouter une story pour un bouton par exemple, vous iriez dans le fichier de stories de ce composant (\`src/app/bouton/bouton.stories.ts\`) puis définiriez plusieurs états ou variations de ce composant. - **Bouton Stories** : Vous utiliseriez les \`args\` pour passer les différentes props au composant et ainsi illustrer différentes versions du bouton (ex : primaire, secondaire, danger etc.) - **Alerte & Accordeon Stories** : Suivez le même principe que pour le bouton, en définissant des variations basées sur les props (\`type\` pour l'alerte, et différents \`items\` pour les accordéons). # Conclusion et Prochaines Étapes En suivant ces étapes, vous avez ajouté des composants de base à votre projet Angular, stylisés avec Tailwind et visible/testable via Storybook. L'aspect modulaire et la documentation intégrée de Storybook facilitent le partage de ces composants au sein de votre équipe et fournissent une référence visuelle pratique pour leur utilisation.

Voici comment intégrer et utiliser cet addon pour afficher du code HTML dans vos stories : # 1. Assurez-vous que l'addon est installé L'addon \`@storybook/addon-essentials\` est souvent installé par défaut avec les configurations modernes de Storybook. S'il n'est pas déjà présent dans votre configuration, vous pouvez l'ajouter : \`\`\`bash npm install @storybook/addon-essentials --save-dev \`\`\` # 2. Configurez votre \`.storybook/main.js\` Vérifiez que \`@storybook/addon-essentials\` est inclus dans la liste des addons. Le fichier \`main.js\` dans votre dossier \`.storybook\` devrait ressembler à quelque chose comme ceci : \`\`\`javascript module.exports = { stories: [ // Vos chemins de stories ici ], addons: [ '@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials', // Autres addons si nécessaire ], }; \`\`\` L'addon Essentials comprend déjà \`addon-docs\`, donc pas besoin de l'ajouter séparément. # 3.

Vous pouvez directement écrire du HTML dans le fichier MDX ou utiliser le composant \`<Source>\` pour afficher du code. \`\`\`mdx import { Meta, Story, Source, Preview } from '@storybook/addon-docs'; <Meta title=\\"Exemple/Composant\\" component={MonComposant} /> # Mon Composant Ceci documente mon composant: <Preview> <Story name=\\"Exemple\\"> <MonComposant /> </Story> </Preview> Voici comment l'utiliser : \`\`\`html <MonComposant /> \`\`\` # 4. Utiliser \`<Source>\` dans CSF Dans un fichier de story CSF, vous pouvez afficher le code source en utilisant le composant \`<Source>\`, mais cela nécessite une petite configuration supplémentaire. Voici un exemple où vous mélangerez JSX et CSF pour cela : \`\`\`javascript import { Source } from '@storybook/addon-docs'; export default { title: 'MonComposant', component: MonComposant, }; export const Exemple = () => <MonComposant />; Exemple.parameters = { docs: { page: () => ( <> <h1>Mon Composant</h1> <p>Ceci est la documentation de mon composant.</p> <Source language=\\"html\\" code={\`<MonComposant />\`} /> </> ), }, }; \`\`\` Note : Puisque nous utilisons du JSX ici dans l'objet \`parameters\`, assurez-vous de configurer Babel correctement si votre projet ne le supporte pas déjà. # En conclusion L'addon Essentials et l'intégration de \`addon-docs\` offrent un puissant ensemble d'outils pour documenter vos composants et leurs usages directement dans l'interface utilisateur de Storybook.

После интенсивной тренировки запасы гликогена в мышцах могут быть существенно исчерпаны, и быстрой углевод, такой как сахар, может быть эффективным способом для их пополнения. Потребление простых углеводов (к которым относится сахар) способствует быстрому повышению уровня глюкозы в крови и, как следствие, быстрому восполнению гликогена в мышцах. Это может быть особенно актуально для атлетов, которые занимаются несколько раз в день или имеют тесно расположенные по времени тренировки, когда время на восстановление ограничено. Тем не менее, использование сахара как источника углеводов после тренировки стоит рассматривать с учетом общих целей питания и здоровья. Для достижения более сбалансированного восстановления и питания, многие специалисты рекомендуют комбинировать простые углеводы с источниками белка и, возможно, некоторыми сложными углеводами, чтобы обеспечить не только восстановление гликогена, но и поддержку ремонта и роста мышечной ткани. Кроме того, при употреблении сахара после тренировки важно учитывать общее потребление сахара в течение дня, поскольку чрезмерное потребление добавленных сахаров может способствовать развитию различных заболеваний, включая ожирение, тип 2 диабет и сердечно-сосудистые заболевания. В общем, сахар может быть полезен для быстрого восполнения гликогена после тренировки, но его использование должно быть сбалансировано с другими питательными веществами и учитывать общие потребности и цели диеты."},{"instruction":"какое количество саха можно принимать при собственном весе 110 килограмм, с учётом того что я придерживаюсь кето-диеты","output":"При соблюдении кето-диеты основное внимание уделяется минимизации углеводов в рационе для поддержания состояния кетоза, при котором организм использует жиры в качестве основного источника энергии, а не глюкозу. В среднем, для поддержания кетоза рекомендуется потреблять не более 20-50 граммов чистых углеводов в день, хотя точное количество может варьироваться в зависимости от индивидуальных факторов, таких как метаболическая гибкость, уровень физической активности и индивидуальные метаболические особенности. С учетом этого, потребление сахара в рамках кето-диеты должно быть крайне ограничено или исключено, поскольку сахар является высококонцентрированным источником углеводов, который может быстро превысить допустимый дневной лимит и вывести организм из состояния кетоза. Если ваш вес составляет 110 килограмм и вы придерживаетесь кето-диеты, важно сосредоточиться на потреблении углеводов, в основном поступающих из низкоуглеводных овощей, орехов и семян в количествах, которые позволяют вам оставаться в состоянии кетоза. Принимая во внимание общую необходимость соблюдения диеты с низким содержанием углеводов, любое добавление сахара в рацион должно быть тщательно взвешено против вашего ежедневного лимита углеводов и, вероятно, должно быть очень ограничено или исключено для поддержания кетоза. В заключение, если вы строго следуете кето-диете, предпочтительнее избегать потребления сахара и сосредоточиться на потреблении питательных веществ из цельных и низкоуглеводных продуктов. Для индивидуальных рекомендаций стоит проконсультироваться с диетологом или специалистом по кето-диете."},{"instruction":"что касаемо периода непосредственно после силовой тренировки?","output":"После силовой тренировки основная цель состоит в поддержке восстановления мышц и пополнении уровня гликогена. Для людей, не придерживающихся кето-диеты, часто рекомендуется потребление углеводов в сочетании с белками для ускорения этих процессов. Однако при соблюдении кето-диеты подход должен быть другим, учитывая ограничения на углеводы. Даже при кето-диете, важно понимать, что непосредственно после тренировки организм может более эффективно использовать углеводы для восполнения гликогена, не влияя сильно на состояние кетоза, особенно после интенсивных и высокоинтенсивных тренировок, которые истощают запасы гликогена. Этот феномен известен как \\"окно восстановления\\". Для людей на кето-диете, которые хотят воспользоваться этим \\"окном восстановления\\" после силовой тренировки, может быть приемлемо потреблять небольшое количество быстрых углеводов в сочетании с белком. Однако, это количество должно быть строго контролируемым, чтобы не вывести организм из состояния кетоза. Как правило, это означает ограничение углеводов в рамках общего ежедневного лимита, поддерживаемого для кетоза (20-50 грамм в день для большинства людей). Итак, даже после тренировки, следует очень осторожно добавлять углеводы, исходя из индивидуальной углеводной толерантности и способности сохранять кетоз. В этот период можно обратить внимание на такие источники углеводов, как авокадо, ягоды или овощи с низким содержанием углеводов, которые также будут способствовать восстановлению и питанию, не превышая углеводные ограничения кето-диеты. В заключение, даже при соблюдении кето-диеты и общем стремлении к минимизации употребления углеводов, некоторая гибкость в их потреблении сразу после силовой тренировки может быть оправдана для поддержки восстановления, при этом очень важно не превышать общее суточное количество углеводов, чтобы поддерживать кетоз. Однако для индивидуальных рекомендаций и точного планирования рациона лучше всего проконсультироваться с диетологом или специалистом по кетогенной диете."},{"instruction":"потребность в каких микронутриентах выше всего после силовой тренировки, и какой вид сухофруктов содержащий достаточное количество углеводов был бы предпочтительней для восполнения дефицита данных микронутриентов и гликогена за счёт содержащихся углеводов в этом виде сухофруктов?","output":"После силовой тренировки важна не только быстрая подпитка углеводами для восстановления гликогена, но и восполнение микронутриентов, которые помогают в восстановлении, регенерации тканей и общем улучшении здоровья. Основные микронутриенты, на которые следует обратить внимание после тренировки, включают: 1. **Магний** - помогает сокращению и расслаблению мышц, поддерживает энергетический метаболизм. 2. **Калий** - важен для гидратации, нервной функции и мышечного сокращения. 3. **Железо** - ключевой компонент для производства гемоглобина и транспорта кислорода. 4. **Цинк** - поддерживает иммунную систему, важен для процесса заживления и роста тканей. 5. **Антиоксиданты** (Витамин C, E, Селен) - помогают бороться с оксидативным стрессом от интенсивных тренировок. По поводу сухофруктов, они действительно могут быть хорошим вариантом для быстрого восполнения уровня гликогена за счет содержащихся углеводов, однако стоит учитывать, что многие сухофрукты высококалорийны и содержат много сахара, так что их потребление следует дозировать. **Финики** могут быть одним из лучших вариантов сухофруктов после тренировки, поскольку: - Они богаты углеводами, что поможет быстро восполнить энергетические запасы. - Содержат калий, магний и даже небольшое количество железа. - У фиников высокий гликемический индекс, что делает их полезными для быстрого восстановления уровня глюкозы в крови после тренировок. Важно помнить, что хоть финики и полезны с точки зрения быстрой энергии и микронутриентов, их потребление следует сбалансировать с другими источниками питательных веществ, особенно белка, для оптимального восстановления после тренировки. Напомню, что важно учитывать индивидуальную переносимость и диетические ограничения, поэтому перед внесением любых значительных изменений в рацион лучше всего проконсультироваться с диетологом или врачом."},{"instruction":"сколько углеводов содержится в финиках и какой у них гликемический индекс?","output":"Финики считаются высокоуглеводными фруктами. В среднем, 100 граммов фиников содержат около 75 граммов углеводов, из которых большая часть приходится на натуральные сахара (глюкоза, фруктоза и сахароза). Это делает финики отличным источником быстро усваиваемых углеводов, что полезно для быстрого восстановления энергетических запасов после тренировки. Гликемический индекс (ГИ) фиников варьируется и может зависеть от их сорта и степени зрелости, но в среднем он находится в диапазоне от 42 до 55. Это считается средним или умеренным уровнем. Гликемический индекс - это мера того, насколько быстро углеводы в пище повышают уровень глюкозы в крови. Несмотря на высокое содержание сахара, умеренный ГИ фиников обусловлен также наличием волокон, которые замедляют усвоение сахаров и смягчают их влияние на уровень сахара в крови. Важно отметить, что употребление фиников хоть и является эффективным способом для быстрого восполнения уровня гликогена и энергии после тренировок, должно быть сбалансировано с другими аспектами питания, особенно если у вас есть определенные заболевания (например, диабет) или цели по контролю веса, так как финики довольно калорийны."},{"instruction":"перепроверь данные касаемо гликемического индекса фиников","output":"Извините за путаницу в предыдущем ответе. Позвольте уточнить информацию о гликемическом индексе (ГИ) фиников. Финики действительно имеют относительно высокий гликемический индекс, который может варьироваться в зависимости от сорта фиников и их обработки. В общем, ГИ фиников может находиться в диапазоне от 35 до 70. Это означает, что для некоторых людей употребление фиников может привести к более резкому повышению уровня глюкозы в крови, чем предполагалось в моем предыдущем ответе. Важно учитывать, что несмотря на высокий ГИ, финики также содержат пищевые волокна, которые могут помогать замедлить абсорбцию сахара и, как следствие, смягчить воздействие на уровень глюкозы в крови. Однако, при введении фиников в рацион, особенно в контексте конкретных диетических целей или при сахарном диабете, важно учитывать их ГИ и общее содержание сахара. Перепроверка этих данных подчеркивает важность учета индивидуальных реакций на различные продукты и их воздействие на метаболизм каждого человека. Всегда рекомендуется проконсультироваться со специалистом в области питания или вашим лечащим врачом, прежде чем вносить значительные изменения в ваш рацион, особенно при наличии хронических состояний здоровья."},{"instruction":"сколько микронутриентов содержится в финиках и какой сорт самый богатый на них?","output":"Финики являются ценным источником микронутриентов, включая витамины и минералы, которые играют важную роль в поддержании здоровья и общего благополучия. Ниже приведен список некоторых ключевых микронутриентов, обычно содержащихся в финиках: - **Витамин B6 (пиридоксин)**: необходим для метаболизма аминокислот и производства нейромедиаторов. - **Магний**: участвует в более чем 300 биохимических процессах в организме, включая поддержку функций мышц и нервной системы, а также помогает регулировать уровни глюкозы в крови и артериальное давление. - **Калий**: способствует поддержанию нормального кровяного давления, регулирует баланс жидкости в организме и необходим для нервной функции и мышечных сокращений. - **Медь**: важна для производства красных кровяных телец и поддержания здоровья нервной системы. - **Селен**: мощный антиоксидант, играющий ключевую роль в поддержании метаболизма и здоровья иммунной системы. - **Железо**: важно для производства гемоглобина и транспорта кислорода в организме. Что касается сорта, то существует множество различных типов фиников, и их питательный состав может незначительно отличаться. Однако, одним из наиболее популярных и широко доступных сортов являются финики Меджул. Финики Меджул отличаются крупным размером, сочностью и сладостью. Они также богаты питательными веществами, включая микронутриенты, упомянутые выше. Хотя финики Меджул могут содержать немного больше микронутриентов по сравнению с некоторыми другими сортами из-за их большего размера и насыщенности, разница может быть несущественной, и выбор определенного сорта часто зависит от личных предпочтений во вкусе и текстуре. В любом случае, финики являются отличным и полезным дополнением к рациону, предлагая разнообразие микронутриентов вместе с быстрой энергией углеводов. Тем не менее, из-за высокого содержания сахара и калорий их стоит употреблять в умеренных количествах."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I'll include comments to make it clearer how to adapt the renaming part to fit your specific requirements. \`\`\`python import os from collections import defaultdict # Assuming the files are in the current working directory # Change 'your_directory_path' to the path where your files are located if they are in a different directory directory_path = 'your_directory_path' filenames = os.listdir(directory_path) # Dictionary to store lists of files for each unique part files_with_part = defaultdict(list) # Fill the dictionary for filename in filenames: unique_part = filename.split('_')[-2] files_with_part[unique_part].append(filename) # Now, we iterate over the dictionary to find duplicates and rename as per your desired convention for part, files in files_with_part.items(): if len(files) > 1: print(f\\"Found duplicates for {part}: {files}\\") for i, filename in enumerate(files, start=1): # Constructing new filename # Example: If you want to add 'Duplicate' and a sequence number to the duplicates new_filename = filename.replace(part, f\\"{part}_Duplicate_{i}\\") old_file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, filename) new_file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, new_filename) # Actually renaming the files os.rename(old_file_path, new_file_path) print(f\\"Renamed '{filename}' to '{new_filename}'\\") # Note: This will update the filenames of duplicates in place.

In the example above, for duplicate filenames, it appends \\"_Duplicate_\\" followed by a sequence number (starting from 1). Adjust this logic based on how you wish to rename your files. - **Environment**: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to rename files in the directory. This script helps in identifying duplicates based on a specific part of the filenames and then renames those files following a custom rule you define for \`new_filename\`.

This usually happens in Redis Cluster setups when a key is moved to a different node due to slot migrations. To handle this in your Python code, you can catch the \`ResponseError\` exception and implement retry logic to handle the key move operation. Here's an example: \`\`\`python import redis import time redis_host = 'your_redis_host' redis_port = 'your_redis_port' password = 'your_redis_password' ssl_cert_reqs = None redis_client = redis.Redis( host=redis_host, port=redis_port, password=password, ssl=True, ssl_cert_reqs=ssl_cert_reqs, decode_responses=True ) def get_key(redis_client, key): try: return redis_client.dump(key) except redis.exceptions.ResponseError as e: if \\"MOVED\\" in str(e): # Retry the operation after a short delay time.sleep(0.1) return get_key(redis_client, key) else: raise key = 'your_key' value = get_key(redis_client, key) print(value) \`\`\` In this code snippet, the \`get_key\` function handles the exception raised when the key is moved and retries the operation after a short delay.

In this case, the client needs to update its slot mapping to avoid the error when accessing keys in their new slots. One way to handle this in Python is to use the \`redis-py-cluster\` library, which automatically handles slot changes by periodically refreshing its mapping of slots to nodes. Here's an example of how you can operate on the whole Redis cluster without waiting for slot changes: \`\`\`python from rediscluster import RedisCluster startup_nodes = [ {\\"host\\": 'host1', \\"port\\": 'port1'}, {\\"host\\": 'host2', \\"port\\": 'port2'}, {\\"host\\": 'host3', \\"port\\": 'port3'} ] password = 'your_password' redis_cluster = RedisCluster( startup_nodes=startup_nodes, decode_responses=True, password=password ) # Operate on the Redis cluster result = redis_cluster.set('key', 'value') print(result) # Retrieve value from the Redis cluster value = redis_cluster.get('key') print(value) \`\`\` By using the \`redis-py-cluster\` library, it manages the slot mapping internally and automatically redirects operations to the correct nodes after a \`MOVED\` error.

This error occurs because Redis Cluster requires that all keys involved in a single command (e.g., \`MGET\`, \`MSET\`) are located on the same slot. To resolve this issue, you can modify your code to ensure that keys are being accessed within the same slot. One way to do this is to pre-process your keys and group them by slot using a technique like \\"hash tags.\\" Here's an example that demonstrates how you can group keys using hash tags to ensure they map to the same slot: \`\`\`python import redis redis_host = 'your_redis_host' redis_port = 'your_redis_port' password = 'your_redis_password' ssl_cert_reqs = None redis_client = redis.Redis( host=redis_host, port=redis_port, password=password, ssl=True, ssl_cert_reqs=ssl_cert_reqs, decode_responses=True ) def group_keys_by_slot(keys): grouped_keys = {} for key in keys: hash_tag_start = key.find('{') if hash_tag_start != -1: hash_tag_end = key.find('}', hash_tag_start) slot = abs(hash(key[hash_tag_start + 1:hash_tag_end])) % 16384 # Assuming 16384 slots in Redis Cluster grouped_keys.setdefault(slot, []).append(key) else: slot = abs(hash(key)) % 16384 grouped_keys.setdefault(slot, []).append(key) return grouped_keys def get_values(redis_client, keys): grouped_keys = group_keys_by_slot(keys) values = [] for slot, key_group in grouped_keys.items(): values.extend(redis_client.mget(key_group)) return values # Example using scan_iter to iterate over keys for key in redis_client.scan_iter(): try: value = get_values(redis_client, [key]) print(f\\"Key: {key}, Value: {value}\\") except redis.exceptions.ResponseError as e: print(f\\"Error accessing key {key}: {e}\\") \`\`\` In this code, we define a function \`group_keys_by_slot\` that groups keys by slot using hash tags.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"explain how the \`patsubst\` command works in a makefile","output":"In a Makefile, the \`patsubst\` function is used to substitute or replace patterns in a list of strings. The basic syntax of the \`patsubst\` function in a Makefile is as follows: \`\`\` (patsubst pattern,replacement,text) \`\`\` - \`pattern\`: The pattern to search for in the \`text\`. - \`replacement\`: The replacement string for the \`pattern\`. - \`text\`: The input list of strings in which the substitution will be applied. The \`patsubst\` function scans the \`text\` for occurrences of the specified \`pattern\` and replaces them with the provided \`replacement\`. Here are some key points about how \`patsubst\` works in a Makefile: 1. **Pattern Matching**: The \`pattern\` in \`patsubst\` can include wildcard characters such as \`%\` (matches any sequence of characters) and \`?\` (matches any single character). Wildcards are used to define patterns that match parts of strings. 2. **Pattern Replacement**: When a match is found in the \`text\`, the matching substring is replaced with the specified \`replacement\`. 3. **Multiple Replacements**: The \`patsubst\` function can replace multiple occurrences of the \`pattern\` in the \`text\` with the \`replacement\`. 4. **Example**: \`\`\`makefile # Define a list of source files with .c extension sources := main.c helper.c utils.c # Use patsubst to replace .c with .o in the list of sources objects := (patsubst %.c, %.o, (sources)) # Output the resulting list of object files all_objects: @echo (objects) \`\`\` In this example, the \`patsubst %.c, %.o, (sources)\` statement substitutes the file extension \`.c\` with \`.o\` in each file name in the \`sources\` list. If the \`sources\` list contains \`main.c\`, \`helper.c\`, and \`utils.c\`, the resulting \`objects\` list will be \`main.o\`, \`helper.o\`, and \`utils.o\`. 5. **Conditional Pattern Matching**: The \`patsubst\` function can be helpful in scenarios where conditional pattern matching and substitution are required within Makefile recipes and variable assignments. By utilizing the \`patsubst\` function effectively in your Makefiles, you can perform pattern-based substitutions and transformations on lists of strings to automate build processes and handle file name transformations efficiently."},{"instruction":"Quel conseil pour les études en Master en informatique","output":"1.

Aqui estão algumas frases que exemplificam bem essa característica: 1. \\"Eu sei que nada sei.\\" - Esta frase, atribuída a Sócrates, faz sentido porque expressa a humildade do conhecimento; no entanto, ao afirmar saber alguma coisa (\\"nada sei\\"), contradiz a própria afirmação. 2. \\"Menos é mais.\\" - Comumente usado no design e na arte, faz sentido ao sugerir que a simplicidade pode levar a um resultado superior. No entanto, literalmente falando, menos não pode ser mais. 3. \\"Esta frase é falsa.\\" - Se a frase é verdadeira, então ela é falsa, mas se é falsa, então é verdadeira.

This approach allows you to read the original CSV file, modify its content by adding the new column, and then write the updated content back to a file. Here's a step-by-step guide: # Step 1: Install Python Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python can handle CSV files directly using its standard library. # Step 2: Prepare Your CSV File Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted and accessible. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume your CSV file is named \`original.csv\`. # Step 3: Write the Python Script You'll write a script to read your original CSV file, add the new column, and save the result to a new file (or overwrite the original, if you prefer). Here's a sample script: \`\`\`python import csv input_file_name = 'original.csv' output_file_name = 'modified.csv' # Open the original CSV file for reading and the result file for writing with open(input_file_name, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as infile, open(output_file_name, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as outfile: # Create CSV reader and writer reader = csv.reader(infile) writer = csv.writer(outfile) # Read the first row (header) and add the new column headers = next(reader) headers.insert(1, 'NewColumn') # 'NewColumn' is the header for the new column writer.writerow(headers) # Process the rest of the rows for row in reader: # Insert the new column value ('mod') into the second position of each row row.insert(1, 'mod') writer.writerow(row) print(\\"File has been modified and saved as 'modified.csv'.\\") \`\`\` # Step 4: Run the Script - Save the script in a file, for instance, \`add_column.py\`. - Open a terminal or command prompt. - Navigate to the directory where your script and \`original.csv\` file are located. - Run the script using Python by executing the command \`python add_column.py\`. After running the script, you'll have a new file named \`modified.csv\` (or whatever you've chosen to name it) in the same directory, containing the original data with an added column named \\"NewColumn\\" (you can rename this to anything you like) as the second column, filled with the value \\"mod\\" for all rows. This technique allows for flexible modifications to CSV files and can be adapted to various similar tasks."},{"instruction":"{FOREST BIOME - TERRARIA} Guide \\"Y-You defeated Calamitas the Supreme Witch?

The Silent Valley “How agreeable and pleasant this valley is,” thought Milo as once again they bounced along the highway, with the Humbug humming snatches of old songs, to his own vast amusement, and Tock sniffing contentedly at the wind. “I really can’t see what Dr. Dischord was so concerned about; there certainly couldn’t be anything unpleasant along this road.” And just as the thought crossed his mind they passed through a heavy stone gateway and everything was very different. At first it was difficult to tell just what had changed—it all looked the same and it all smelled the same—but, for some reason, nothing sounded the same. “I wonder what’s happened?” said Milo. At least that’s what he tried to say, for, although his lips moved, not a sound came from his mouth. And suddenly he realized what it was, for Tock was no longer ticking and the Humbug, although happily singing, was doing so in complete silence. The wind no longer rustled the leaves, the car no longer squeaked, and the insects no longer buzzed in the fields. Not the slightest thing could be heard, and it felt as if, in some mysterious way, a switch had been thrown and all the sound in the world had been turned off at the same instant. The Humbug, suddenly realizing what had happened, leaped to his feet in terror, and Tock worriedly checked to see if he was still keeping time. It was certainly a strange feeling to know that no matter how loudly or softly you chatted or rattled or bumped, it all came out the same way—as nothing. “How dreadful,” thought Milo as he slowed down the car. The three of them began to talk and shout at once with absolutely no result until, hardly noticing where they were going, they had driven into the midst of a large crowd of people marching along the road. Some of them were singing at the tops of their nonexistent voices and the others were carrying large signs which proclaimed: DOWN WITH SILENCE ALL QUIET IS NO DIET IT’S LAUDABLE TO BE AUDIBLE MORE SOUND FOR ALL And one enormous banner stated simply: HEAR HERE Except for these, and the big brass cannon being pulled along behind, they all looked very much like the residents of any other small valley to which you’ve never been. When the car had stopped, one of them held up a placard which said: “WELCOME TO THE VALLEY OF SOUND.” And the others cheered as loudly as possible, which was not very loud at all. “HAVE YOU COME TO HELP US?” asked another, stepping forward with his question. “PLEASE!” added a third. Milo tried desperately to say who he was and where he was going, but to no avail. As he did, four more placards announced: LISTEN LOOK CAREFULLY AND WE WILL TELL YOU OF OUR TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE And while two of them held up a large blackboard, a third, writing as fast as he could, explained why there was nothing but quiet in the Valley of Sound. “At a place in the valley not far from here,” he began, \\"where the echoes used to gather and the winds came to rest, there is a great stone fortress, and in it lives the Soundkeeper, who rules this land. When the old king of Wisdom drove the demons into the distant mountains, he appointed her guardian of all sounds and noises, past, present, and future. “For years she ruled as a wise and beloved monarch, each morning at sunrise releasing the day’s new sounds, to be borne by the winds throughout the kingdom, and each night at moonset gathering in the old sounds, to be catalogued and filed in the vast storage vaults below.” The writer paused for a moment to mop his brow and then, since the blackboard was full, erased it completely and continued anew from the top. “She was generous to a fault and provided us with all the sound we could possibly use: for singing as we worked, for bubbling pots of stew, for the chop of an ax and the crash of a tree, for the creak of a hinge and the hoot of an owl, for the squish of a shoe in the mud and the friendly tapping of rain on the roof, and for the sweet music of pipes and the sharp snap of winter ice cracking on the ground.” He paused again as a tear of longing rolled from cheek to lip with the sweetsalty taste of an old memory. \\"And all these sounds, when once used, would be carefully placed in alphabetical order and neatly kept for future reference. Everyone lived in peace, and the valley flourished as the happy home of sound. But then things began to change. \\"Slowly at first, and then in a rush, more people came to settle here and brought with them new ways and new sounds, some very beautiful and some less so. But everyone was so busy with the things that had to be done that they scarcely had time to listen at all. And, as you know, a sound which is not heard disappears forever and is not to be found again. “People laughed less and grumbled more, sang less and shouted more, and the sounds they made grew louder and uglier. It became difficult to hear even the birds or the breeze, and soon everyone stopped listening for them.” He again cleared the blackboard, as the Humbug choked back a sob, and continued writing. \\"The Soundkeeper grew worried and disconsolate. Each day there were fewer sounds to be collected, and most of those were hardly worth keeping. Many people thought it was the weather, and others blamed the moon, but the general consensus of opinion held that the trouble began at the time that Rhyme and Reason were banished. But, no matter what the cause, no one knew what to do. \\"Then one day Dr. Dischord appeared in the valley with his wagon of medicines and the bluish smoggy DYNNE. He made a thorough examination and promised to cure everyone of everything; and the Soundkeeper let him try. “He gave several bad-tasting spoonfuls of medicine to every adult and child, and it worked—but not really as expected. For he cured everybody of everything but noise. The Soundkeeper became furious. She chased him from the valley forever and then issued the following decree: ” ‘FROM THIS DAY FORWARD THE VALLEY OF SOUND SHALL BE SILENT. SINCE SOUND IS NO LONGER APPRECIATED, I HEREBY ABOLISH IT. PLEASE RETURN ALL UNUSED AMOUNTS TO THE FORTRESS IMMEDIATELY.’ “And that’s the way it has been ever since,” he concluded sadly. “There is nothing we can do to change it, and each day new hardships are reported.” A small man, with his arms full of letters and messages, pushed through the crowd and offered them to Milo. Milo took one which read: Dear Soundkeeper, We had a thunderstorm last week and the thunder still hasn’t arrived. How long should we wait? Yours truly, A friend. Then he took a telegram which stated: BAND CONCERT GREAT SUCCESS STOP WHEN MAY WE EXPECT THE MUSIC STOP “Now you see,” continued the writer, “why you must help us attack the fortress and free sound.” “What can I do?” wrote Milo. “You must visit the Soundkeeper and bring from the fortress one sound, no matter how small, with which to load our cannon. For, if we can reach the walls with the slightest noise, they will collapse and free the rest. It won’t be easy, for she is hard to deceive, but you must try.” Milo thought for just a moment and then, with a resolute “I shall,” volunteered to go. Within a few minutes he stood bravely at the fortress door. “Knock, knock,” he wrote neatly on a piece of paper, which he pushed under the crack. In a moment the great portal swung open, and, as it closed behind him, a gentle voice sang out: “Right this way; I’m in the parlor.” “Can I talk now?” cried Milo happily, hearing his voice once again. “Yes, but only in here,” she replied softly. “Now do come into the parlor.” Milo walked slowly down the long hallway and into the little room where the Soundkeeper sat listening intently to an enormous radio set, whose switches, dials, knobs, meters, and speaker covered one whole wall, and which at the moment was playing nothing. “Isn’t that lovely?” she sighed. \\"It’s my favorite program—fifteen minutes of silence—and after that there’s a half hour of quiet and then an interlude of lull. Why, did you know that there are almost as many kinds of stillness as there are sounds? But, sadly enough, no one pays any attention to them these days. “Have you ever heard the wonderful silence just before the dawn?” she inquired. “Or the quiet and calm just as a storm ends? Or perhaps you know the silence when you haven’t the answer to a question you’ve been asked, or the hush of a country road at night, or the expectant pause in a roomful of people when someone is just about to speak, or, most beautiful of all, the moment after the door closes and you’re all alone in the whole house? Each one is different, you know, and all very beautiful, if you listen carefully.” As she spoke, the thousands of little bells and chimes which covered her from head to toe tinkled softly and, as if in reply, the telephone began to ring, too. “For someone who loves silence, she certainly talks a great deal,” thought Milo. “At one time I was able to listen to any sound made any place at any time,” the Soundkeeper remarked, pointing towards the radio wall, “but now I merely—” “Pardon me,” interrupted Milo as the phone continued to ring, “but aren’t you going to answer it?” “Oh no, not in the middle of the program,” she replied, and turned the silence up a little louder. “But it may be important,” insisted Milo. “Not at all,” she assured him; “it’s only me. It gets so lonely around here, with no sounds to distribute or collect, that I call myself seven or eight times a day just to see how I am.” “How are you?” he asked politely. “Not very well, I’m afraid. I seem to have a touch of static,” she complained. “But what brings you here? Of course—you’ve come to tour the vaults. Well, they’re usually open to the public only on Mondays from two to four, but since you’ve traveled so far, we’ll have to make an exception. Follow me, please.” She quickly bounced to her feet with a chorus of jingles and chimes and started down the hallway. “Don’t you just love jingles and chimes? I do,” she answered quickly. “Besides, they’re very convenient, for I’m always getting lost in this big fortress, and all I have to do is listen for them and then I know exactly where I am.” They entered a tiny cagelike elevator and traveled down for fully three quarters of a minute, stopping finally in an immense vault, whose long lines of file drawers and storage bins stretched in all directions from where here began to where there ended, and from floor to ceiling. “Every sound that’s ever been made in history is kept here,” said the Soundkeeper, skipping down one of the corridors with Milo in hand. “For instance, look here.” She opened one of the drawers and pulled out a small brown envelope. “This is the exact tune George Washington whistled when he crossed the Delaware on that icy night in 1777.” Milo peered into the envelope and, sure enough, that’s exactly what was in it. “But why do you collect them all?” he asked as she closed the drawer. “If we didn’t collect them,” said the Soundkeeper as they continued to stroll through the vault, “the air would be full of old sounds and noises bouncing around and bumping into things. It would be terribly confusing, because you’d never know whether you were listening to an old one or a new one. Besides, I do like to collect things, and there are more sounds than almost anything else. Why, I have everything here from the buzz of a mosquito a million years ago to what your mother said to you this morning, and if you come back here in two days, I’ll tell you what she said tomorrow. It’s really very simple; let me show you. Say a word—any word.” “Hello,” said Milo, for that was all he could think of. “Now where do you think it went?” she asked with a smile. “I don’t know,” said Milo, shrugging his shoulders. “I always thought that—” “Most people do,” she hummed, peering down one of the corridors. “Now, let me see: first we find the cabinet with today’s sounds. Ah, here it is. Then we look under G for greetings, then under M for Milo, and here it is already in its envelope. So, you see, the whole system is quite automatic. It’s a shame we hardly use it any more.” “That’s wonderful,” gasped Milo. “May I have one little sound as a souvenir?” “Certainly,” she said with pride, and then, immediately thinking better of it, added, “not. And don’t try to take one, because it’s strictly against the rules.” Milo was crestfallen. He had no idea how to steal a sound, even the smallest one, for the Soundkeeper always had at least one eye carefully focused on him. “Now for a look at the workshops,” she cried, whisking him through another door and into a large abandoned laboratory full of old pieces of equipment, all untended and rusting. “This is where we used to invent the sounds,” she said wistfully. “Do they have to be invented?” asked Milo, who seemed surprised at almost everything she told him. “I thought they just were.” “No one realizes how much trouble we go through to make them,” she complained. “Why, at one time this shop was crowded and busy from morning to night.” “But how do you invent a sound?” Milo inquired. “Oh, that’s very easy,” she said. “First you must decide exactly what the sound looks like, for each sound has its own exact shape and size. Then you make some of them here in the shop, and grind each one three times into an invisible powder, and throw a little of each into the air every time you need it.” “But I’ve never seen a sound,” Milo insisted. “You never see them out there,” she said, waving her arm in the general direction of everywhere, “except every once in a while on a very cold morning when they freeze. But in here we see them all the time. Here, let me show you.” She picked up a padded stick and struck a nearby bass drum six times. Six large woolly, fluffy cotton balls, each about two feet across, rolled silently out onto the floor. “You see,” she said, putting some of them into a large grinder. “Now listen.” And she took a pinch of the invisible powder and threw it into the air with a “BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.” “Do you know what a handclap looks like?” Milo shook his head. “Try it,” she commanded. He clapped his hands once and a single sheet of clean white paper fluttered to the floor. He tried it three more times and three more sheets of paper did the very same thing. And then he applauded as fast as he could and a great cascade of papers filled the air. “Isn’t that simple? And it’s the same for all sounds. If you think about it, you’ll soon know what each one looks like. Take laughter, for instance,” she said, laughing brightly, and a thousand tiny brightly colored bubbles flew into the air and popped noiselessly. “Or speech,” she continued. “Some of it is light and airy, some sharp and pointed, but most of it, I’m afraid, is just heavy and dull.” “How about music?” asked Milo excitedly. “Right over here—we weave it on our looms. Symphonies are the large beautiful carpets with all the rhythms and melodies woven in. Concertos are these tapestries, and all the other bolts of cloth are serenades, waltzes, overtures, and rhapsodies. And we also have some of the songs that you often sing,” she cried, holding up a handful of brightly colored handkerchiefs. She stopped for a moment and said sadly, “We even had one section over there that did nothing but put the sound of the ocean into sea shells. This was once such a happy place.” “Then why don’t you make sound for everyone now?” he shouted, so eagerly that the Soundkeeper leaped back in surprise. “Don’t shout so, young man! If there’s one thing we need more of around here, it’s less noise. Now come with me and I’ll tell you all about it—and put that down immediately!” Her last remark was directed toward Milo’s efforts to stuff one of the large drumbeats into his back pocket. They returned quickly to the parlor, and when the Soundkeeper had settled herself in a chair and carefully tuned the radio to a special hour of hush, Milo asked his question once again, in a somewhat lower voice. “It doesn’t make me happy to hold back the sounds,” she began softly, “for if we listen to them carefully they can sometimes tell us things far better than words.” “But if that is so,” asked Milo—and he had no doubt that it was—“shouldn’t you release them?” “NEVER!” she cried. “They just use them to make horrible noises which are ugly to see and worse to hear. I leave all that to Dr. Dischord and that awful, awful DYNNE.” “But some noises are good sounds, aren’t they?” he insisted. “That may be true,” she replied stubbornly, “but if they won’t make the sounds that I like, they won’t make any.” “But—” he started to say, and it got no further than that. For while he was about to say that he didn’t think that that was quite fair (a thought to which the obstinate Soundkeeper might not have taken kindly) he suddenly discovered the way he would carry his little sound from the fortress. In the instant between saying the word and before it sailed off into the air he had clamped his lips shut—and the “but” was trapped in his mouth, all made but not spoken. “Well, I mustn’t keep you all day,” she said impatiently. “Now turn your pockets out so that I can see that you didn’t steal anything and you can be on your way.” When he had satisfied the Soundkeeper, he nodded his farewell—for it would have been most impractical to say “Thank you” or “Good afternoon”—and raced out the door. 13. Unfortunate Conclusions With his mouth shut tight, and his feet moving as fast as thoughts could make them, Milo ran all the way back to the car. There was great excitement when he arrived, as Tock raced happily down the road to greet him. The Humbug personally accepted all congratulations from the crowd. “Where is the sound?” someone hastily scribbled on the blackboard, and they all waited anxiously for the reply. Milo caught his breath, picked up the chalk, and explained simply, “It’s on the tip of my tongue.” Several people excitedly threw their hats into the air, some shouted what would have been a loud hurrah, and the rest pushed the heavy cannon into place. They aimed it directly at the thickest part of the fortress wall and packed it full of gunpowder. Milo stood on tiptoe, leaned over into the cannon’s mouth, and parted his lips. The small sound dropped silently to the bottom and everything was ready. In another moment the fuse was lit and sputtering. “I hope no one gets hurt,” thought Milo, and, before he had time to think again, an immense cloud of gray and white smoke leaped from the gun and, along with it, so softly that it was hardly heard, came the sound of— BUT It flew toward the wall for several seconds in a high, lazy arc and then struck ever so lightly just to the right of the big door. For an instant there was an ominous stillness, quieter and more silent than ever before, as if even the air was holding its breath. And then, almost immediately, there was a blasting, roaring, thundering smash, followed by a crushing, shattering, bursting crash, as every stone in the fortress came toppling to the ground and the vaults burst open, spilling the sounds of history into the wind. Every sound that had ever been uttered or made, from way back to when there were none, to way up when there were too many, came hurtling out of the debris in a way that sounded as though everyone in the world was laughing, whistling, shouting, crying, singing, whispering, humming, screaming, coughing, and sneezing, all at the same time. There were bits of old speeches floating about, as well as recited lessons, gunshots from old wars, babies’ cries, auto horns, waterfalls, electric fans, galloping horses, and a great deal of everything else. For a while there was total and deafening confusion and then, almost as quickly as they’d come, all the old sounds disappeared over the hill in search of their new freedom, and things were normal again. The people quickly went about their busy talkative business and, as the smoke and dust cleared, only Milo, Tock, and the Humbug noticed the Soundkeeper sitting disconsolately on a pile of rubble. “I’m terribly sorry,” said Milo sympathetically as the three of them went to console her. “But we had to do it,” added Tock, sniffing around the ruins. “What a terrible mess,” observed the Humbug, with his knack for saying exactly the wrong thing. The Soundkeeper looked around with an expression of unrelieved sadness on her unhappy face, “It will take years to collect all those sounds again,” she sobbed, “and even longer to put them back in proper order. But it’s all my fault. For you can’t improve sound by having only silence. The problem is to use each at the proper time.” As she spoke, the familiar and unmistakable squinch-squanch, squinchsquanch of the DYNNE’s heavy toot-steps could be heard plodding over the hill, and when he finally appeared he was dragging an incredibly large sack behind him. “Can anyone use these sounds?” he puffed, mopping his forehead. “They all came over the hill at once and none of them are awful enough for me.” The Soundkeeper peered into the sack, and there were all the sounds which had burst from the vaults. “How nice of you to return them!” she cried happily. “You and the doctor must come by for an evening of beautiful music when my fortress is repaired.” The thought of it so horrified the DYNNE that he excused himself immediately and dashed off down the road in a great panic. “I hope I haven’t offended him,” she said with some concern. “He only likes unpleasant sounds,” volunteered Tock. “Ah yes,” she sighed; “I keep forgetting that many people do. But I suppose they are necessary, for you’d never really know how pleasant one was unless you knew how unpleasant it wasn’t.” She paused for a moment, then continued: “If only Rhyme and Reason were here, I’m sure things would improve.” “That’s why we’re going to rescue them,” said Milo proudly. “What a long, hard journey that will be! You’ll need some nourishment,” she cried, handing Milo a small brown package, neatly wrapped and tied with string. “Now remember: they’re not for eating, but for listening, because you’ll often be hungry for sounds as well as food. Here are street noises at night, train whistles a long way off, dry leaves burning, busy department stores, crunching toast, creaking bedsprings, and, of course, all kinds of laughter. There’s a little of each, and in faroff lonely places I think you’ll be glad to have them.” “I’m sure we will,” replied Milo gratefully. “Just take this road to the sea and turn left,” she told them. “You’ll soon be in Digitopolis.” Arid almost before she had finished, they had said good-by and left the valley behind them. The shore line was peaceful and flat, and the calm sea bumped it playfully along the sandy beach. In the distance a beautiful island covered with palm trees and flowers beckoned invitingly from the sparkling water. “Nothing can possibly go wrong now,” cried the Humbug happily, and as soon as he’d said it he leaped from the car, as if stuck by a pin, and sailed all the way to the little island. “And we’ll have plenty of time,” answered Tock, who hadn’t noticed that the bug was missing—and he, too, suddenly leaped into the air and disappeared. “It certainly couldn’t be a nicer day,” agreed Milo, who was too busy looking at the road to see that the others had gone. And in a split second he was gone also. He landed next to Tock and the terrified Humbug on the tiny island, which now looked completely different. Instead of palms and flowers, there were only rocks and the twisted stumps of long-dead trees. It certainly didn’t seem like the same place they had seen from the road. “Pardon me,” said Milo to the first man who happened by; “can you tell me where I am?” “Pardon me,” replied the man; “can you tell me who I am?” The man was dressed in a shaggy tweed jacket and knickers with long woolen stockings and a cap that had a peak both front and back, and he seemed as confused as he could be. “You must know who you are,” said Milo impatiently. “You must know where you are,” he replied with equal annoyance. “Oh dear, this is going to be difficult,” Milo whispered to Tock. “I wonder if we can help him.” They conferred for a few minutes and finally the bug looked up and said, “Can you describe yourself?” “Yes, indeed,” the man replied happily. “I’m as tall as can be”—and he grew straight up until all that could be seen of him were his shoes and stockings—“and I’m as short as can be”—and he shrank down to the size of a pebble. “I’m as generous as can be,” he said, handing each of them a large red apple, “and I’m as selfish as can be,” he snarled, grabbing them back again. “I’m as strong as can be,” he roared, lifting an enormous boulder over his head, “and I’m as weak as can be,” he gasped, staggering under the weight of his hat. “I’m as smart as can be,” he remarked in twelve different languages, “and I’m as stupid as can be,” he admitted, putting both feet in one shoe. “I’m as graceful as can be,” he hummed, balancing on one toe, “and I’m as clumsy as can be,” he cried, sticking his thumb in his eye. “I’m as fast as can be,” he announced, running around the island twice in no time at all, “and I’m as slow as can be,” he complained, waving good-by to a snail. “Is that any help to you?” Once again they conferred in busy whispers until all three agreed. “It’s really very simple,” said the Humbug, twirling his cane. “If everything you say is true,” added Tock. “Then, without a doubt,” Milo concluded brightly, “you must be Canby.” “Of course, yes, of course,” the man shouted. “Why didn’t I think of that? I’m as happy as can be.” Then he quickly sat down, put his head in his hands, and sighed. “But I’m also as sad as can be.” “Now will you tell me where we are?” asked Tock as he looked around the desolate island. “To be sure,” said Canby; “you’re on the Island of Conclusions. Make yourself at home. You’re apt to be here for some time.” “But how did we get here?” asked Milo, who was still a bit puzzled by being there at all. “You jumped, of course,” explained Canby. “That’s the way most everyone gets here. It’s really quite simple: every time you decide something without having a good reason, you jump to Conclusions whether you like it or not. It’s such an easy trip to make that I’ve been here hundreds of times.” “But this is such an unpleasant-looking place,” Milo remarked. “Yes, that’s true,” admitted Canby; “it does look much better from a distance.” As he spoke, at least eight or nine more people sailed onto the island from every direction possible. “Well, I’m going to jump right back,” announced the Humbug, who took two or three practice bends, leaped as far as he could, and landed in a heap two feet away. “That won’t do at all,” scolded Canby, helping him to his feet. “You can never jump away from Conclusions. Getting back is not so easy. That’s why we’re so terribly crowded here.” That was certainly the truth, for all along the bleak shore and clustered on the rocks for as far as anyone could see were enormous crowds of people, all sadly looking out to sea. “Isn’t there even a boat?” asked Milo, anxious to get on with his trip. “Oh no,” replied Canby, shaking his head. “The only way back is to swim, and that’s a very long and a very hard way.” “I don’t like to get wet,” moaned the unhappy bug, and he shuddered at the thought. “Neither do they,” said Canby sadly. “That’s what keeps them here. But I wouldn’t worry too much about it, for you can swim all day in the Sea of Knowledge and still come out completely dry. Most people do. But you must excuse me now. I have to greet the new arrivals. As you know, I’m as friendly as can be.” Over the Humbug’s strenuous objections, Milo and Tock decided to swim, and, protesting loudly, the bug was dragged along with them toward the sea. Canby hurried off to answer more questions, and the last thing he was heard to say was “Pardon me, can you tell me who I am?” They swam and swam and swam for what seemed like hours, and only Tock’s firm encouragement kept Milo struggling through the icy water. At last they reached the shore, thoroughly exhausted and, except for the bug, completely soaked. “That wasn’t bad at all,” the Humbug said, straightening his tie and brushing himself off. “I must visit there again.” “I’m sure you will,” gasped Milo. “But from now on I’m going to have a very good reason before I make up my mind about anything. You can lose too much time jumping to Conclusions.” The car was just where they’d left it, and in a moment they were on their way again as the road turned away from the sea and began its long climb into the mountains. The warm sun and billowy breezes dried them as they went. “I hope we reach Digitopolis soon,” said Milo, thinking of the breakfast they hadn’t eaten. “I wonder how far it is.” 14. The Dodecahedron Leads the Way Up ahead, the road divided into three and, as if in reply to Milo’s question, an enormous road sign, pointing in all three directions, stated clearly: DIGITOPOLIS 5 Miles 1,600 Rods 8,800 Yards 26,400 Feet 316,800 Inches 633,600 Half inches AND THEN SOME “Let’s travel by miles,” advised the Humbug; “it’s shorter.” “Let’s travel by half inches,” suggested Milo; “it’s quicker.” “But which road should we take?” asked Tock. “It must make a difference.” As they argued, a most peculiar little figure stepped nimbly from behind the sign and approached them, talking all the while. “Yes, indeed; indeed it does; certainly; my, yes; it does make a difference; undoubtedly.” He was constructed (for that’s really the only way to describe him) of a large assortment of lines and angles connected together into one solid many-sided shape—somewhat like a cube that’s had all its corners cut off and then had all its corners cut off again. Each of the edges was neatly labeled with a small letter, and each of the angles with a large one. He wore a handsome beret on top, and peering intently from one of his several surfaces was a very serious face. Perhaps if you look at the picture you’ll know what I mean. When he reached the car, the figure doffed his cap and recited in a loud clear voice: “My angles are many. My sides are not few. I’m the Dodecahedron. Who are you?” “What’s a Dodecahedron?” inquired Milo, who was barely able to pronounce the strange word. “See for yourself,” he said, turning around slowly. “A Dodecahedron is a mathematical shape with twelve faces.” Just as he said it, eleven other faces appeared, one on each surface, and each one wore a different expression. “I usually use one at a time,” he confided, as all but the smiling one disappeared again. “It saves wear and tear. What are you called?” “Milo,” said Milo. “That is an odd name,” he said, changing his smiling face for a frowning one. “And you only have one face.” “Is that bad?” asked Milo, making sure it was still there. “You’ll soon wear it out using it for everything,” replied the Dodecahedron. “Now I have one for smiling, one for laughing, one for crying, one for frowning, one for thinking, one for pouting, and six more besides. Is everyone with one face called a Milo?” “Oh no,” Milo replied; “some are called Henry or George or Robert or John or lots of other things.” “How terribly confusing,” he cried. “Everything here is called exactly what it is. The triangles are called triangles, the circles are called circles, and even the same numbers have the same name. Why, can you imagine what would happen if we named all the twos Henry or George or Robert or John or lots of other things? You’d have to say Robert plus John equals four, and if the four’s name were Albert, things would be hopeless.” “I never thought of it that way,” Milo admitted. “Then I suggest you begin at once,” admonished the Dodecahedron from his admonishing face, “for here in Digitopolis everything is quite precise.” “Then perhaps you can help us decide which road to take,” said Milo. “By all means,” he replied happily. “There’s nothing to it. If a small car carrying three people at thirty miles an hour for ten minutes along a road five miles long at 11:35 in the morning starts at the same time as three people who have been traveling in a little automobile at twenty miles an hour for fifteen minutes on another road exactly twice as long as one half the distance of the other, while a dog, a bug, and a boy travel an equal distance in the same time or the same distance in an equal time along a third road in mid-October, then which one arrives first and which is the best way to go?” “Seventeen!” shouted the Humbug, scribbling furiously on a piece of paper. “Well, I’m not sure, but—” Milo stammered after several minutes of frantic figuring. “You’ll have to do better than that,” scolded the Dodecahedron, “or you’ll never know how far you’ve gone or whether or not you’ve ever gotten there.” “I’m not very good at problems,” admitted Milo. “What a shame,” sighed the Dodecahedron. “They’re so very useful. Why, did you know that if a beaver two feet long with a tail a foot and a half long can build a dam twelve feet high and six feet wide in two days, all you would need to build Boulder Dam is a beaver sixty-eight feet long with a fifty-one-foot tail?” “Where would you find a beaver that big?” grumbled the Humbug as his pencil point snapped. “I’m sure I don’t know,” he replied, “but if you did, you’d certainly know what to do with him.” “That’s absurd,” objected Milo, whose head was spinning from all the numbers and questions. “That may be true,” he acknowledged, “but it’s completely accurate, and as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong? If you want sense, you’ll have to make it yourself.” “All three roads arrive at the same place at the same time,” interrupted Tock, who had patiently been doing the first problem. “Correct!” shouted the Dodecahedron. “And I’ll take you there myself. Now you can see how important problems are. If you hadn’t done this one properly, you might have gone the wrong way.” “I can’t see where I made my mistake,” said the Humbug, frantically rechecking his figures. “But if all the roads arrive at the same place at the same time, then aren’t they all the right way?” asked Milo. “Certainly not!” he shouted, glaring from his most upset face. “They’re all the wrong way. Just because you have a choice, it doesn’t mean that any of them has to be right.” He walked to the sign and quickly spun it around three times. As he did, the three roads vanished and a new one suddenly appeared, heading in the direction that the sign now pointed. “Is every road five miles from Digitopolis?” asked Milo. “I’m afraid it has to be,” the Dodecahedron replied, leaping onto the back of the car. “It’s the only sign we’ve got.” The new road was quite bumpy and full of stones, and each time they hit one, the Dodecahedron bounced into the air and landed on one of his faces, with a sulk or a smile or a laugh or a frown, depending upon which one it was. “We’ll soon be there,” he announced happily, after one of his short flights. “Welcome to the land of numbers.” “It doesn’t look very inviting,” the bug remarked, for, as they climbed higher and higher, not a tree or a blade of grass could be seen anywhere. Only the rocks remained. “Is this the place where numbers are made?” asked Milo as the car lurched again, and this time the Dodecahedron sailed off down the mountainside, head over heels and grunt over grimace, until he landed sad side up at what looked like the entrance to a cave. “They’re not made,” he replied, as if nothing had happened. “You have to dig for them. Don’t you know anything at all about numbers?” “Well, I don’t think they’re very important,” snapped Milo, too embarrassed to admit the truth. “NOT IMPORTANT!” roared the Dodecahedron, turning red with fury. “Could you have tea for two without the two—or three blind mice without the three? Would there be four corners of the earth if there weren’t a four? And how would you sail the seven seas without a seven?” “All I meant was—” began Milo, but the Dodecahedron, overcome with emotion and shouting furiously, carried right on. “If you had high hopes, how would you know how high they were? And did you know that narrow escapes come in all different widths? Would you travel the whole wide world without ever knowing how wide it was? And how could you do anything at long last,” he concluded, waving his arms over his head, “without knowing how long the last was? Why, numbers are the most beautiful and valuable things in the world. Just follow me and I’ll show you.” He turned on his heel and stalked off into the cave. “Come along, come along,” he shouted from the dark hole. “I can’t wait for you all day.” And in a moment they’d followed him into the mountain. It took several minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dim light, and during that time strange scratching, scraping, tapping, scuffling noises could be heard all around them. “Put these on,” instructed the Dodecahedron, handing each of them a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top. “Where are we going?” whispered Milo, for it seemed like the kind of place in which you whispered. “We’re here,” he replied with a sweeping gesture. “This is the numbers mine.” Milo squinted into the darkness and saw for the first time that they had entered a vast cavern lit only by a soft, eerie glow from the great stalactites which hung ominously from the ceiling. Passages and corridors honeycombed the walls and wound their way from floor to ceiling, up and down the sides of the cave. And, everywhere he looked, Milo saw little men no bigger than himself busy digging and chopping, shoveling and scraping, pulling and tugging carts full of stone from one place to another. “Right this way,” instructed the Dodecahedron, “and watch where you step.” As he spoke, his voice echoed and re-echoed and reechoed again, mixing its sound with the buzz of activity all around them. Tock trotted along next to Milo, and the Humbug, stepping daintily, followed behind. “Whose mine is it?” asked Milo, stepping around two of the loaded wagons. “BY THE FOUR MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE HAIRS ON MY HEAD, IT’S MINE, OF COURSE!” bellowed a voice from across the cavern. And striding toward them came a figure who could only have been the Mathemagician. He was dressed in a long flowing robe covered entirely with complex mathematical equations and a tall pointed cap that made him look very wise. In his left hand he carried a long staff with a pencil point at one end and a large rubber eraser at the other. “It’s a lovely mine,” apologized the Humbug, who was always intimidated by loud noises. “The biggest number mine in the kingdom,” said the Mathemagician proudly. “Are there any precious stones in it?” asked Milo excitedly. “PRECIOUS STONES!” he roared, even louder than before. And then he leaned over toward Milo and whispered softly, “By the eight million two hundred and forty-seven thousand three hundred and twelve threads in my robe, I’ll say there are. Look here.” He reached into one of the carts and pulled out a small object, which he polished vigorously on his robe. When he held it up to the light, it sparkled brightly. “But that’s a five,” objected Milo, for that was certainly what it was. “Exactly,” agreed the Mathemagician; “as valuable a jewel as you’ll find anywhere. Look at some of the others.” He scooped up a great handful of stones and poured them into Milo’s arms. They included all the numbers from one to nine, and even an assortment of zeros. “We dig them and polish them right here,” volunteered the Dodecahedron, pointing to a group of workers busily employed at the buffing wheels; “and then we send them all over the world. Marvelous, aren’t they?” “They are exceptional,” said Tock, who had a special fondness for numbers. “So that’s where they come from,” said Milo, looking in awe at the glittering collection of numbers. He returned them to the Dodecahedron as carefully as possible but, as he did, one dropped to the floor with a smash and broke in two. The Humbug winced and Milo looked terribly concerned. “Oh, don’t worry about that,” said the Mathemagician as he scooped up the pieces. “We use the broken ones for fractions.” “Haven’t you any diamonds or emeralds or rubies?” asked the bug irritably, for he was quite disappointed in what he’d seen so far. “Yes, indeed,” the Mathemagician replied, leading them to the rear of the cave; “right this way.” There, piled into enormous mounds that reached almost to the ceiling, were not only diamonds and emeralds and rubies but also sapphires, amethysts, topazes, moonstones, and garnets. It was the most amazing mass of wealth that any of them had ever seen. “They’re such a terrible nuisance,” sighed the Mathemagician, “and no one can think of what to do with them. So we just keep digging them up and throwing them out. Now,” he said, taking a silver whistle from his pocket and blowing it loudly, “let’s have some lunch.” And for the first time in his life the astonished bug couldn’t think of a thing to say. 15. This Way to Infinity Into the cavern rushed eight of the strongest miners carrying an immense caldron which bubbled and sizzled and sent great clouds of savory steam spiraling slowly to the ceiling. A sweet yet pungent aroma hung in the air and drifted easily from one anxious nose to the other, stopping only long enough to make several mouths water and a few stomachs growl. Milo, Tock, and the Humbug watched eagerly as the rest of the workers put down their tools and gathered around the big pot to help themselves. “Perhaps you’d care for something to eat?” said the Mathemagician, offering each of them a heaping bowlful. “Yes, sir,” said Milo, who was beside himself with hunger. “Thank you,” added Tock. The Humbug made no reply, for he was already too busy eating, and in a moment the three of them had finished absolutely everything they’d been given. “Please have another portion,” said the Mathemagician, filling their bowls once more; and as quickly as they’d finished the first one the second was emptied too “Don’t stop now,” he insisted, serving them again, and again, and again, and again, and again. “How very strange,” thought Milo as he finished his seventh helping. \\"Each one I eat makes me a little hungrier than the one before. “Do have some more,” suggested the Mathemagician, and they continued to eat just as fast as he filled the plates. After Milo had eaten nine portions, Tock eleven, and the Humbug, without once stopping to look up, twenty-three, the Mathemagician blew his whistle for a second time and immediately the pot was removed and the miners returned to work. “U-g-g-g-h-h-h,” gasped the bug, suddenly realizing that he was twenty-three times hungrier than when he started, “I think I’m starving.” “Me, too,” complained Milo, whose stomach felt as empty as he could ever remember; “and I ate so much.” “Yes, it was delicious, wasn’t it?” agreed the pleased Dodecahedron, wiping the gravy from several of his mouths. “It’s the specialty of the kingdom—subtraction stew.” “I have more of an appetite than when I began,” said Tock, leaning weakly against one of the larger rocks. “Certainly,” replied the Mathemagician; “what did you expect? The more you eat, the hungrier you get. Everyone knows that.” “They do?” said Milo doubtfully. “Then how do you ever get enough?” “Enough?” he said impatiently. “Here in Digitopolis we have our meals when we’re full and eat until we’re hungry. That way, when you don’t have anything at all, you have more than enough. It’s a very economical system. You must have been quite stuffed to have eaten so much.” “It’s completely logical,” explained the Dodecahedron. “The more you want, the less you get, and the less you get, the more you have. Simple arithmetic, that’s all. Suppose you had something and added something to it. What would that make?” “More,” said Milo quickly. “Quite correct,” he nodded. “Now suppose you had something and added nothing to it. What would you have?” “The same,” he answered again, without much conviction. “Splendid,” cried the Dodecahedron. “And suppose you had something and added less than nothing to it. What would you have then?” “FAMINE!” roared the anguished Humbug, who suddenly realized that that was exactly what he’d eaten twenty-three bowls of. “It’s not as bad as all that,” said the Dodecahedron from his most sympathetic face. “In a few hours you’ll be nice and full again—just in time for dinner.” “Oh dear,” said Milo sadly and softly. “I only eat when I’m hungry.” “What a curious idea,” said the Mathemagician, raising his staff over his head and scrubbing the rubber end back and forth several times on the ceiling. “The next thing you’ll have us believe is that you only sleep when you’re tired.” And by the time he’d finished the sentence, the cavern, the miners, and the Dodecahedron had vanished, leaving just the four of them standing in the Mathemagician’s workshop. “I often find,” he casually explained to his dazed visitors, “that the best way to get from one place to another is to erase everything and begin again. Please make yourself at home.” “Do you always travel that way?” asked Milo as he glanced curiously at the strange circular room, whose sixteen tiny arched windows corresponded exactly to the sixteen points of the compass. Around the entire circumference were numbers from zero to three hundred and sixty, marking the degrees of the circle, and on the floor, walls, tables, chairs, desks, cabinets, and ceiling were labels showing their heights, widths, depths, and distances to and from each other. To one side was a gigantic note pad set on an artist’s easel, and from hooks and strings hung a collection of scales, rulers, measures, weights, tapes, and all sorts of other devices for measuring any number of things in every possible way. “No indeed,” replied the Mathemagician, and this time he raised the sharpened end of his staff, drew a thin straight line in the air, and then walked gracefully across it from one side of the room to the other. “Most of the time I take the shortest distance between any two points. And, of course, when I should be in several places at once,” he remarked, writing 7 × 1 = 7 carefully on the note pad, “I simply multiply.” Suddenly there were seven Mathemagicians standing side by side, and each one looked exactly like the other. “How did you do that?” gasped Milo. “There’s nothing to it,” they all said in chorus, “if you have a magic staff.” Then six of them canceled themselves out and simply disappeared. “But it’s only a big pencil,” the Humbug objected, tapping at it with his cane. “True enough,” agreed the Mathemagician; “but once you learn to use it, there’s no end to what you can do.” “Can you make things disappear?” asked Milo excitedly. “Why, certainly,” he said, striding over to the easel. “Just step a little closer and watch carefully.” After demonstrating that there was nothing up his sleeves, in his hat, or behind his back, he wrote quickly: 4 + 9 − 2 × 16 + 1 ÷ 3 × 6 − 67 + 8 × 2 − 3 + 26 − 1 ÷ 34 + 3 ÷ 7 + 2 − 5 = Then he looked up expectantly. “Seventeen!” shouted the bug, who always managed to be first with the wrong answer. “It all comes to zero,” corrected Milo. “Precisely,” said the Mathemagician, making a very theatrical bow, and the entire line of numbers vanished before their eyes. “Now is there anything else you’d like to see?” “Yes, please,” said Milo. “Can you show me the biggest number there is?” “I’d be delighted,” he replied, opening one of the closet doors. “We keep it right here. It took four miners just to dig it out.” Inside was the biggest Milo had ever seen. It was fully twice as high as the Mathemagician. “No, that’s not what I mean,” objected Milo. “Can you show me the longest number there is?” “Surely,” said the Mathemagician, opening another door. “Here it is. It took three carts to carry it here.” Inside this closet was the longest imaginable. It was just about as wide as the three was high. “No, no, no, that’s not what I mean either,” he said, looking helplessly at Tock. “I think what you would like to see,” said the dog, scratching himself just under half-past four, “is the number of greatest possible magnitude.” “Well, why didn’t you say so?” said the Mathemagician, who was busily measuring the edge of a raindrop. “What’s the greatest number you can think of?” “Nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine,” recited Milo breathlessly. “Very good,” said the Mathemagician. “Now add one to it. Now add one again,” he repeated when Milo had added the previous one. “Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add—” “But when can I stop?” pleaded Milo. “Never,” said the Mathemagician with a little smile, “for the number you want is always at least one more than the number you’ve got, and it’s so large that if you started saying it yesterday you wouldn’t finish tomorrow.” “Where could you ever find a number so big?” scoffed the Humbug. “In the same place they have the smallest number there is,” he answered helpfully; “and you know what that is.” “Certainly,” said the bug, suddenly remembering something to do at the other end of the room. “One one-millionth?” asked Milo, trying to think of the smallest fraction possible. “Almost,” said the Mathemagician. “Now divide it in half. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide—” “Oh dear,” shouted Milo, holding his hands to his ears, “doesn’t that ever stop either?” “How can it,” said the Mathemagician, “when you can always take half of whatever you have left until it’s so small that if you started to say it right now you’d finish even before you began?” “Where could you keep anything so tiny?” Milo asked, trying very hard to imagine such a thing. The Mathemagician stopped what he was doing and explained simply, “Why, in a box that’s so small you can’t see it—and that’s kept in a drawer that’s so small you can’t see it, in a dresser that’s so small you can’t see it, in a house that’s so small you can’t see it, on a street that’s so small you can’t see it, in a city that’s so small you can’t see it, which is part of a country that’s so small you can’t see it, in a world that’s so small you can’t see it.” Then he sat down, fanned himself with a handkerchief, and continued. “Then, of course, we keep the whole thing in another box that’s so small you can’t see it— and, if you follow me, I’ll show you where to find it.” They walked to one of the small windows and there, tied to the sill, was one end of a line that stretched along the ground and into the distance until completely out of sight. “Just follow that line forever,” said the Mathemagician, “and when you reach the end, turn left. There you’ll find the land of Infinity, where the tallest, the shortest, the biggest, the smallest, and the most and the least of everything are kept.” “I really don’t have that much time,” said Milo anxiously. “Isn’t there a quicker way?” “Well, you might try this flight of stairs,” he suggested, opening another door and pointing up. “It goes there, too.” Milo bounded across the room and started up the stairs two at a time. “Wait for me, please,” he shouted to Tock and the Humbug. “I’ll be gone just a few minutes.” 16. A Very Dirty Bird Up he went—very quickly at first—then more slowly—then in a little while even more slowly than that—and finally, after many minutes of climbing up the endless stairway, one weary foot was barely able to follow the other. Milo suddenly realized that with all his effort he was no closer to the top than when he began, and not a great deal further from the bottom. But he struggled on for a while longer, until at last, completely exhausted, he collapsed onto one of the steps. “I should have known it,” he mumbled, resting his tired legs and filling his lungs with air. “This is just like the line that goes on forever, and I’ll never get there.” “You wouldn’t like it much anyway,” someone replied gently. “Infinity is a dreadfully poor place. They can never manage to make ends meet.” Milo looked up, with his head still resting heavily in his hand; he was becoming quite accustomed to being addressed at the oddest times, in the oddest places, by the oddest people—and this time he was not at all disappointed. Standing next to him on the step was exactly one half of a small child who had been divided neatly from top to bottom. “Pardon me for staring,” said Milo, after he had been staring for some time, “but I’ve never seen half a child before.” “It’s .58 to be precise,” replied the child from the left side of his mouth (which happened to be the only side of his mouth). “I beg your pardon?” said Milo. “It’s .58,” he repeated; “it’s a little bit more than a half.” “Have you always been that way?” asked Milo impatiently, for he felt that that was a needlessly fine distinction. “My goodness, no,” the child assured him. “A few years ago I was just .42 and, believe me, that was terribly inconvenient.” “What is the rest of your family like?” said Milo, this time a bit more sympathetically. “Oh, we’re just the average family,” he said thoughtfully; “mother, father, and 2.58 children—and, as I explained, I’m the .58.” “It must be rather odd being only part of a person,” Milo remarked. “Not at all,” said the child. “Every average family has 2.58 children, so I always have someone to play with. Besides, each family also has an average of 1.3 automobiles, and since I’m the only one who can drive three tenths of a car, I get to use it all the time.” “But averages aren’t real,” objected Milo; “they’re just imaginary.” “That may be so,” he agreed, “but they’re also very useful at times. For instance, if you didn’t have any money at all, but you happened to be with four other people who had ten dollars apiece, then you’d each have an average of eight dollars. Isn’t that right?” “I guess so,” said Milo weakly. “Well, think how much better off you’d be, just because of averages,” he explained convincingly. “And think of the poor farmer when it doesn’t rain all year: if there wasn’t an average yearly rainfall of 37 inches in this part of the country, all his crops would wither and die.” It all sounded terribly confusing to Milo, for he had always had trouble in school with just this subject. “There are still other advantages,” continued the child. “For instance, if one rat were cornered by nine cats, then, on the average, each cat would be 10 per cent rat and the rat would be 90 per cent cat. If you happened to be a rat, you can see how much nicer it would make things.” “But that can never be,” said Milo, jumping to his feet. “Don’t be too sure,” said the child patiently, “for one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are. You see,” he went on, “it’s very much like your trying to reach Infinity. You know that it’s there, but you just don’t know where— but just because you can never reach it doesn’t mean that it’s not worth looking for.” “I hadn’t thought of it that way,” said Milo, starting down the stairs. “I think I’ll go back now.” “A wise decision,” the child agreed; “but try again someday—perhaps you’ll get much closer.” And, as Milo waved good-by, he smiled warmly, which he usually did on the average of 47 times a day. “Everyone here knows so much more than I do,” thought Milo, as he leaped from step to step. “I’ll have to do a lot better if I’m going to rescue the princesses.” In a few moments he’d reached the bottom again and burst into the workshop, where Tock and the Humbug were eagerly watching the Mathemagician perform. “Ah, back already,” he cried, greeting him with a friendly wave. “I hope you found what you were looking for.” “I’m afraid not,” admitted Milo. And then he added in a very discouraged tone, “Everything in Digitopolis is much too difficult for me.” The Mathemagician nodded knowingly and stroked his chin several times. “You’ll find,” he remarked gently, “that the only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that’s hardly worth the effort.” Milo tried very hard to understand all the things he’d been told, and all the things he’d seen, and, as he spoke, one curious thing still bothered him. “Why is it,” he said quietly, “that quite often even the things which are correct just don’t seem to be right?” A look of deep melancholy crossed the Mathemagician’s face and his eyes grew moist with sadness. Everything was silent, and it was several minutes before he was able to reply at all. “How very true,” he sobbed, supporting himself on the staff. “It has been that way since Rhyme and Reason were banished.” “Quite so,” began the Humbug. “I personally feel that—” “AND ALL BECAUSE OF THAT STUBBORN WRETCH AZAZ,” roared the Mathemagician, completely overwhelming the bug, for now his sadness had changed to fury and he stalked about the room adding up anger and multiplying wrath. “IT’S ALL HIS FAULT.” “Perhaps if you discussed it with him—” Milo started to say, but never had time to finish. “He’s much too unreasonable,” interrupted the Mathemagician again. “Why, just last month I sent him a very friendly letter, which he never had the courtesy to answer. See for yourself.” He handed Milo a copy of the letter, which read: “But maybe he doesn’t understand numbers,” said Milo, who found it a little difficult to read himself. “NONSENSE!” he bellowed. “Everyone understands numbers. No matter what language you speak, they always mean the same thing. A seven is a seven anywhere in the world.” “My goodness,” thought Milo, “everybody is so terribly sensitive about the things they know best.” “With your permission,” said Tock, changing the subject, “we’d like to rescue Rhyme and Reason.” “Has Azaz agreed to it?” the Mathemagician inquired. “Yes, sir,” the dog assured him. “THEN I DON’T,” he thundered again, “for since they’ve been banished, we’ve never agreed on anything—and we never will.” He emphasized his last remark with a dark and ominous look. “Never?” asked Milo, with the slightest touch of disbelief in his voice. “NEVER!” he repeated. “And if you can prove otherwise, you have my permission to go.” “Well,” said Milo, who had thought about this problem very carefully ever since leaving Dictionopolis. “Then with whatever Azaz agrees, you disagree.” “Correct,” said the Mathemagician with a tolerant smile. “And with whatever Azaz disagrees, you agree.” “Also correct,” yawned the Mathemagician, nonchalantly cleaning his fingernails with the point of his staff. “Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with whatever each of you agrees with,” said Milo triumphantly; “and if you both disagree with the same thing, then aren’t you really in agreement?” “I’VE BEEN TRICKED!” cried the Mathemagician helplessly, for no matter how he figured, it still came out just that way. “Splendid effort,” commented the Humbug jovially; “exactly the way I would have done it myself.” “And now may we go?” added Tock. The Mathemagician accepted his defeat with grace, nodded weakly, and then drew the three travelers to his side. “It’s a long and dangerous journey,” he began softly, and a furrow of concern creased his forehead. “Long before you find them, the demons will know you’re there. Watch for them well,” he emphasized, “for when they appear, it might be too late.” The Humbug shuddered down to his shoes, and Milo felt the tips of his fingers suddenly grow cold. “But there is one problem even more serious than that,” he whispered ominously. “What is it?” gasped Milo, who was not sure he really wanted to know. “I’m afraid I can tell you only when you return. Come along,” said the Mathemagician, “and I’ll show you the way.” And, simply by carrying the three, he transported them all to the very edge of Digitopolis. Behind them lay all the kingdoms of Wisdom, and up ahead a narrow rutted path led toward the mountains and darkness. “We’ll never get the car up that,” said Milo unhappily. “True enough,” replied the Mathemagician, “but you can be in Ignorance quick enough without riding all the way; and if you’re to be successful, it will have to be step by step.” “But I would like to take my gifts,” he insisted. “So you shall,” announced the Dodecahedron, who appeared from nowhere with his arms full. “Here are your sights, here are your sounds, and here,” he said, handing Milo the last of them disdainfully, “are your words.” “And, most important of all,” added the Mathemagician, “here is your own magic staff. Use it well and there is nothing it cannot do for you.” He placed in Milo’s breast pocket a small gleaming pencil which, except for the size, was much like his own. Then, with a last word of encouragement, he and the Dodecahedron (who was simultaneously sobbing, frowning, pining, and sighing from four of his saddest faces) made their farewells and watched as the three tiny figures disappeared into the forbidding mountains of Ignorance. Almost immediately the light began to fade as the difficult path wandered aimlessly upward, inching forward almost as reluctantly as the trembling Humbug. Tock as usual led the way, sniffing ahead for danger, and Milo, his bag of precious possessions slung over one shoulder, followed silently and resolutely behind. “Perhaps someone should stay back to guard the way,” said the unhappy bug, offering his services; but, since his suggestion was met with silence, he followed glumly along. The higher they went, the darker it became, though it wasn’t the darkness of night, but rather more like a mixture of lurking shadows and evil intentions which oozed from the slimy moss-covered cliffs and blotted out the light. A cruel wind shrieked through the rocks and the air was thick and heavy, as if it had been used several times before. On they went, higher and higher up the dizzying trail, on one side the sheer stone walls and brutal peaks towering above them, and on the other an endless, limitless, bottomless nothing. “I can hardly see a thing,” said Milo, taking hold of Tock’s tail as a sticky mist engulfed the moon. “Perhaps we should wait until morning.” “They’ll be mourning for you soon enough,” came a reply from directly above, and this was followed by a hideous cackling laugh very much like someone choking on a fishbone. Clinging to one of the greasy rocks and blending almost perfectly with it was a large, unkempt, and exceedingly soiled bird who looked more like a dirty floor mop than anything else. He had a sharp, dangerous beak, and the one eye he chose to open stared down maliciously. “I don’t think you understand,” said Milo timidly as the watchdog growled a warning. “We’re looking for a place to spend the night.” “It’s not yours to spend,” the bird shrieked again, and followed it with the same horrible laugh. “That doesn’t make any sense, you see—” he started to explain. “Dollars or cents, it’s still not yours to spend,” the bird replied haughtily. “But I didn’t mean—” insisted Milo. “Of course you’re mean,” interrupted the bird, closing the eye that had been open and opening the one that had been closed. “Anyone who’d spend a night that doesn’t belong to him is very mean.” “Well, I thought that by—” he tried again desperately. “That’s a different story,” interjected the bird a bit more amiably. “If you want to buy, I’m sure I can arrange to sell, but with what you’re doing you’ll probably end up in a cell anyway.” “That doesn’t seem right,” said Milo helplessly, for, with the bird taking everything the wrong way, he hardly knew what he was saying. “Agreed,” said the bird, with a sharp click of his beak, “but neither is it left, although if I were you I would have left a long time ago.” “Let me try once more,” he said in an effort to explain. “In other words—” “You mean you have other words?” cried the bird happily. “Well, by all means, use them. You’re certainly not doing very well with the ones you have now.” “Must you always interrupt like that?” said Tock irritably, for even he was becoming impatient. “Naturally,” he cackled; “it’s my job. I take the words right out of your mouth. Haven’t we met before? I’m the Everpresent Wordsnatcher, and I’m sure I know your friend the bug.” And then he leaned all the way forward and gave a terrible knowing smile. The Humbug, who was too big to hide and too frightened to move, denied everything. “Is everyone who lives in Ignorance like you?” asked Milo. “Much worse,” he said longingly. “But I don’t live here. I’m from a place very far away called Context.” “Don’t you think you should be getting back?” suggested the bug, holding one arm up in front of him. “What a horrible thought.” The bird shuddered. “It’s such an unpleasant place that I spend almost all my time out of it. Besides, what could be nicer than these grimy mountains?” “Almost anything,” thought Milo as he pulled his collar up. And then he asked the bird, “Are you a demon?” “I’m afraid not,” he replied sadly, as several filthy tears rolled down his beak. “I’ve tried, but the best I can manage to be is a nuisance,” and, before Milo could reply, he flapped his dingy wings and flew off in a cascade of dust and dirt and fuzz. “Wait!” shouted Milo, who’d thought of many more questions he wanted to ask. “Thirty-four pounds,” shrieked the bird as he disappeared into the fog. “He was certainly no help,” said Milo after they had been walking again for some time. “That’s why I drove him off,” cried the Humbug, fiercely brandishing his cane. “Now let’s find the demons.” “That might be sooner than you think,” remarked Tock, looking back at the suddenly trembling bug; and the trail turned again and continued to climb. In a few minutes they’d reached the crest, only to find that beyond it lay another one even higher, and beyond that several more, whose tops were lost in the swirling darkness. For a short stretch the path became broad and flat, and just ahead, leaning comfortably against a dead tree, stood a very elegant-looking gentleman. He was beautifully dressed in a dark suit with a well-pressed shirt and tie. His shoes were polished, his nails were clean, his hat was well brushed, and a white handkerchief adorned his breast pocket. But his expression was somewhat blank. In fact, it was completely blank, for he had neither eyes, nose, nor mouth. “Hello, little boy,” he said, amiably shaking Milo by the hand. “And how’s the faithful dog?” he inquired, giving Tock three or four strong and friendly pats. “And who is this handsome creature?” he asked, tipping his hat to the very pleased Humbug. “I’m so happy to see you all.” “What a pleasant surprise to meet someone so nice,” they all thought, “and especially here.” “I wonder if you could spare me a little of your time,” he inquired politely, “and help with a few small jobs?” “Why, of course,” said the Humbug cheerfully. “Gladly,” added Tock. “Yes, indeed,” said Milo, who wondered for just a moment how it was possible for someone so agreeable to have a face with no features at all. “Splendid,” he said happily, “for there are just three tasks. Firstly, I would like to move this pile from here to there,” he explained, pointing to an enormous mound of fine sand; “but I’m afraid that all I have is this tiny tweezers.” And he gave them to Milo, who immediately began transporting one grain at a time. “Secondly, I would like to empty this well and fill the other; but I have no bucket, so you’ll have to use this eye dropper.” And he handed it to Tock, who undertook at once to carry one drop at a time from well to well. “And, lastly, I must have a hole through this cliff, and here is a needle to dig it.” The eager Humbug quickly set to work picking at the solid granite wall. When they had all been safely started, the very pleasant man returned to the tree and, leaning against it once more, continued to stare vacantly down the trail, while Milo, Tock, and the Humbug worked hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour— 17. Unwelcoming Committee The Humbug whistled gaily at his work, for he was never as happy as when he had a job which required no thinking at all. After what seemed like days, he had dug a hole scarcely large enough for his thumb. Tock shuffled steadily back and forth with the dropper in his teeth, but the full well was still almost as full as when he began, and Milo’s new pile of sand was hardly a pile at all. “How very strange,” said Milo, without stopping for a moment. “I’ve been working steadily all this time, and I don’t feel the slightest bit tired or hungry. I could go right on the same way forever.” “Perhaps you will,” the man agreed with a yawn (at least it sounded like a yawn). “Well, I wish I knew how long it was going to take,” Milo whispered as the dog went by again. “Why not use your magic staff and find out?” replied Tock as clearly as anyone could with an eye dropper in his mouth. Milo took the shiny pencil from his pocket and quickly calculated that, at the rate they were working, it would take each of them eight hundred and thirty-seven years to finish. “Pardon me,” he said, tugging at the man’s sleeve and holding the sheet of figures up for him to see, “but it’s going to take eight hundred and thirty-seven years to do these jobs.” “Is that so?” replied the man, without even turning around. “Well, you’d better get on with it then.” “But it hardly seems worth while,” said Milo softly. “WORTH WHILE!” the man roared indignantly. “All I meant was that perhaps it isn’t too important,” Milo repeated, trying not to be impolite. “Of course it’s not important,” he snarled angrily. “I wouldn’t have asked you to do it if I thought it was important.” And now, as he turned to face them, he didn’t seem quite so pleasant. “Then why bother?” asked Tock, whose alarm suddenly began to ring. “Because, my young friends,” he muttered sourly, “what could be more important than doing unimportant things? If you stop to do enough of them, you’ll never get to where you’re going.” He punctuated his last remark with a villainous laugh. “Then you must—” gasped Milo. “Quite correct!” he shrieked triumphantly. “I am the Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort, and monster of habit.” The Humbug dropped his needle and stared in disbelief while Milo and Tock began to back away slowly. “Don’t try to leave,” he ordered, with a menacing sweep of his arm, “for there’s so very much to do, and you still have over eight hundred years to go on the first job.” “But why do only unimportant things?” asked Milo, who suddenly remembered how much time he spent each day doing them. “Think of all the trouble it saves,” the man explained, and his face looked as if he’d be grinning an evil grin—if he could grin at all. “If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you’ll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won’t have the time. For there’s always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing, and if it weren’t for that dreadful magic staff, you’d never know how much time you were wasting.” As he spoke, he tiptoed slowly toward them with his arms outstretched and continued to whisper in a soft, deceitful voice, “Now do come and stay with me. We’ll have so much fun together. There are things to fill and things to empty, things to take away and things to bring back, things to pick up and things to put down, and besides all that we have pencils to sharpen, holes to dig, nails to straighten, stamps to lick, and ever so much more. Why, if you stay here, you’ll never have to think again—and with a little practice you can become a monster of habit, too.” They were all transfixed by the Trivium’s soothing voice, but just as he was about to clutch them in his well-manicured fingers a voice cried out, “RUN! RUN!” Milo, who thought it was Tock, turned suddenly and dashed up the trail. “RUN! RUN!” it shouted again, and this time Tock thought it was Milo and quickly followed him. “RUN! RUN!” it urged once more, and now the Humbug, not caring who said it, ran desperately after his two friends, with the Terrible Trivium close behind. “This way! This way!” the voice called again. They turned in its direction and scrambled up the difficult slippery rocks, sliding back at each step almost as far as they’d gone forward. With a great effort and many helping paws from Tock, they reached the top of the ridge at last, but only two steps ahead of the furious Trivium. “Over here! Over here!” advised the voice, and without a moment’s hesitation they started through a puddle of sticky ooze, which quickly became ankle-deep, then knee-deep, then hip-deep, until finally they were struggling along through what felt very much like a waist-deep pool of peanut butter. The Trivium, who had discovered a mound of pebbles which needed counting, followed no more, but stood at the edge shaking his fist, shouting horrible threats, and promising to rouse every demon in the mountains. “What a nasty fellow,” gasped Milo, who was having great difficulty just getting his legs to move. “I hope I never meet him again.” “I believe he’s stopped chasing us,” said the bug, looking back over his shoulder. “It’s not what’s behind that worries me,” remarked Tock as they stepped from the sticky mess, “but what’s ahead.” “Keep going straight! Keep going straight!” counseled the voice as they continued to pick their way carefully along the new path. “Now step up! Now step up!” it recommended, and almost before they knew what had happened, they had all taken a step up and then plunged to the bottom of a deep murky pit. “But he said up!” Milo complained bitterly from where he lay sprawling. “Well, I hope you didn’t expect to get anywhere by listening to me,” said the voice gleefully. “We’ll never get out of here,” the Humbug moaned, looking at the steep, smooth sides of the pit. “That is quite an accurate evaluation of the situation,” said the voice coldly. “Then why did you help us at all?” shouted Milo angrily. “Oh, I’d do as much for anybody,” he replied; “bad advice is my specialty. For, as you can plainly see, I’m the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, round-bodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster—and, if I do say so myself, one of the most frightening fiends in this whole wild wilderness. With me here, you wouldn’t dare try to escape.” And, with that, he shuffled to the edge of the pit and leered down at his helpless prisoners. Tock and the Humbug turned away in fright, but Milo, who had learned by now that people are not always what they say they are, reached for his telescope and took a long look for himself. And there at the rim of the hole, instead of what he’d expected, stood a small furry creature with very worried eyes and a rather sheepish grin. “Why, you’re not long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thicknecked, broad-shouldered, round-bodied, short-armed, bowlegged, or big-footed— and you’re not at all frightening,” said Milo indignantly. “What kind of a demon are you?” The little creature, who seemed stunned at being found out, leaped back out of sight and began to whimper softly. “I’m the demon of insincerity,” he sobbed. “I don’t mean what I say, I don’t mean what I do, and I don’t mean what I am. Most people who believe what I tell them go the wrong way, and stay there, but you and your awful telescope have spoiled everything. I’m going home.” And, crying hysterically, he stamped off in a huff. “It certainly pays to have a good look at things,” observed Milo as he wrapped up the telescope with great care. “Now all we have to do is climb out,” said Tock, placing his front paws as high on the wall as he could. “Here, hop up on my back.” Milo climbed onto the dog’s shoulders. Then the bug crawled up both of them and, by standing on Milo’s head, just managed to hook his cane on the root of an old gnarled tree. With loud complaints he hung on doggedly until the other two had climbed out over him and pulled him up, somewhat dazed and discouraged. “I’ll lead the way for a while,” he said, brushing himself off. “Follow me and we’ll stay out of trouble.” He guided them along one of five narrow ledges, all of which led to a grooved and rutted plateau. They stopped for a moment to rest and make plans, but before they had done either the whole mountain trembled violently and, with a sudden lurch, rose high into the air, carrying them along with it. For, quite accidentally, they had stepped into the callused hand of the Gelatinous Giant. “AND WHAT HAVE WE HERE!” he roared, looking curiously at the tiny figures huddled in his palm—and licking his lips. He was an incredible size even sitting down, with long unkempt hair, bulging eyes, and a shape hardly worth speaking of. He looked, in fact, very much like a colossal bowl of jelly, without the bowl. “HOW DARE YOU DISTURB MY NAP!” he bellowed furiously, and the force of his hot breath tumbled them over in his hand. “We’re terribly sorry,” said Milo meekly, when he’d untangled himself, “but you looked just like part of the mountain.” “Naturally,” the giant replied in a more normal voice (but even this was like an explosion). “I have no shape of my own, so I try to be just like whatever I’m near. In the mountains I’m a lofty peak, on the beach a broad sand bar, in the forest a towering oak, and sometimes in the city I’m a very handsome twelve-story apartment house. I just hate to be conspicuous; it’s really not safe, you know.” Then he looked at them again with hungry eyes and wondered how well they’d taste. “You look much too big to be afraid of anything,” said Milo quickly, for the giant had already begun to open his mouth wide. “I’m not,” he said, with a slight shiver that ran all over his gelatinous body. “I’m afraid of everything. That’s why I’m so ferocious. If the others found out, I’d just die. Now do be quiet while I eat my breakfast.” He raised his hand toward his gaping mouth and the Humbug shut his eyes tightly and clasped both hands over his head. “Then aren’t you really a fearful demon?” Milo asked desperately, on the assumption that the giant had been brought up well enough not to talk with a mouthful. “Well, approximately yes,” he replied, lowering his arm to the vast relief of the bug; “that is, comparatively no. What I mean is, relatively maybe—in other words, roughly perhaps. What does everyone else think? There, you see,” he said peevishly; “I’m even afraid to make a positive statement. So please stop asking questions before I lose my appetite altogether.” Then he raised his arm again and prepared to swallow the three of them in one gulp. “Why don’t you help us rescue Rhyme and Reason? Then maybe things will get better,” shouted Milo again, this time almost too late, for in another instant they would have all been gone. “Oh, I wouldn’t do that,” said the Giant thoughtfully, lowering his arm once more. “I mean, why not leave well enough alone? That is, it’ll never work. I wouldn’t take a chance. In other words, let’s keep things as they are—changes are so frightening.” As he spoke he began to look a bit ill. “Maybe I’ll just eat one of you,” he remarked unhappily, “and save the rest for later. I don’t feel very well.” “I have a better idea,” said Milo. “You do?” interrupted the giant, losing any desire to eat at all. “If it’s one thing I can’t swallow, it’s ideas: they’re so hard to digest.” “I have a box full of all the ideas in the world,” said Milo, proudly holding up the gift King Azaz had given him. The thought of it terrified the giant, who began to shake like an enormous pudding. “PUT ME DOWN AND JUST GO AWAY,” he pleaded, forgetting for a moment who had hold of whom; “AND PLEASE DON’T OPEN THAT BOX!” In another moment he’d set them down on the next jagged peak and, with panic in his eyes, lumbered off to warn the others of this terrible new threat. But news travels quickly. The Wordsnatcher, the Trivium, and the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, roundbodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster had already spread the alarm throughout the evil, unenlightened mountains. And out the demons came—from every cave and crevice, through every fissure and crack, from under the rocks and up from the mud, stomping and shuffling, slithering and sliding, through the murky shadows. And all had only one thought in mind: destroy the intruders and protect Ignorance. From where they stood, Milo, Tock, and the Humbug could see them moving steadily forward, still far away but coming quickly. On all sides the cliffs were alive with this evil collection of crawling, looming, creeping, lurching shapes. Some could be seen plainly, others were but dim silhouettes, and yet still more, only now beginning to stir from their foul places, would be along much sooner than they were wanted. “We’d better hurry,” barked Tock, “or they’re sure to catch us.” And he started up the trail again. Milo took one deep breath and did the same; and the bug, now that he knew what lay behind, ran ahead with renewed enthusiasm. 18. Castle in the Air Higher and higher they climbed, in search of the castle and the two banished princesses—from one crest to the next, from jagged rock to jagged rock, up frightful crumbling cliffs and along desperately narrow ledges where a single misstep meant only good-by. An ominous silence dropped like a curtain around them and, except for the scuffling of their frantic footsteps, there wasn’t a sound. The world that Milo knew was a million thoughts away, and the demons—the demons were there in the distance. “They’re gaining!” shouted the Humbug, wishing he’d never looked back. “But there it is!” cried Milo at the same instant, for straight ahead, climbing up from atop the highest peak, was a spidery spiral stair, and at the other end stood the Castle in the Air. “I see it, I see it,” said the happy bug as they struggled up the twisting mountain trail. But what he didn’t see was that, curled up right in front of the first step, was a little round man in a frock coat, sleeping peacefully on a very large and well-worn ledger. A long quill pen sat precariously behind his ear, there were inkstains all over his hands and face as well as his clothing, and he wore a pair of the thickest eyeglasses that Milo had ever seen. “Be very careful,” whispered Tock when they’d finally reached the top, and the Humbug stepped gingerly around and started up the stairs. “NAMES?” the little man called out briskly, just as the startled bug reached the first step. He sat up quickly, pulled the book out from under him, put on a green eye-shade, and waited with his pen poised in the air. “Well, I—” stammered the bug. “NAMES?” he cried again, and as he did he opened the book to page 512 and began to write furiously. The quill made horrible scratching noises, and the point, which was continually catching in the paper, flicked tiny inkblots all over him. As they called out their names, he noted them carefully in alphabetical order. “Splendid, splendid, splendid,” he muttered to himself. “I haven’t had an M in ages.” “What do you want our names for?” asked Milo, looking anxiously over his shoulder. “We’re in a bit of a hurry.” “Oh, this won’t take a minute,” the man assured them. “I’m the official Senses Taker, and I must have some information before I can take your senses. Now, if you’ll just tell me when you were born, where you were born, why you were born, how old you are now, how old you were then, how old you’ll be in a little while, your mother’s name, your father’s name, your aunt’s name, your uncle’s name, your cousin’s name, where you live, how long you’ve lived there, the schools you’ve attended, the schools you haven’t attended, your hobbies, your telephone number, your shoe size, shirt size, collar size, hat size, and the names and addresses of six people who can verify all this information, we’ll get started. One at a time, please; stand in line; and no pushing, no talking, no peeking.” The Humbug, who had difficulty remembering anything, went first. The little man leisurely recorded each answer in five different places, pausing often to polish his glasses, clear his throat, straighten his tie, and blow his nose. He managed also to cover the distressed bug from head to foot in ink. “NEXT!” he announced very officially. “I do wish he’d hurry,” said Milo, stepping forward, for in the distance he could see the first of the demons already beginning to scale the mountain toward them, no more than a few minutes away. The little man wrote with painful deliberation, finally finished with both Milo and Tock, and looked up happily. “May we go now?” asked the dog, whose sensitive nose had picked up a loathsome, evil smell that grew stronger every second. “By all means,” said the man agreeably, “just as soon as you finish telling me your height; your weight; the number of books you read each year; the number of books you don’t read each year; the amount of time you spend eating, playing, working, and sleeping every day; where you go on vacations; how many ice-cream cones you eat in a week; how far it is from your house to the barbershop; and which is your favorite color. Then, after that, please fill out these forms and applications— three copies of each—and be careful, for if you make one mistake, you’ll have to do them all over again.” “Oh dear,” said Milo, looking at the pile of papers, “we’ll never finish these.” And even as he spoke the demons swarmed stealthily up the mountain. “Come, come,” said the Senses Taker, chuckling gaily to himself, “don’t take all day. I’m expecting several more visitors any minute now.” They set to work feverishly on the difficult forms, and when they’d finished, Milo placed them all in the little man’s lap. He thanked them politely, took off his eye-shade, put the pen behind his ear, closed the book, and went back to sleep. The Humbug took one horrified look back over his shoulder and quickly started up the stairs. “DESTINATION?” shouted the Senses Taker, sitting up again, putting on his eyeshade, taking the pen from behind his ear, and opening his book. “But I thought—” protested the astonished bug. “DESTINATION?” he repeated, making several notations in the ledger. “The Castle in the Air,” said Milo impatiently. “Why bother?” said the Senses Taker, pointing into the distance. “I’m sure you’d rather see what I have to show you.” As he spoke, they all looked up, but only Milo could see the gay and exciting circus there on the horizon. There were tents and side shows and rides and even wild animals—everything a little boy could spend hours watching. “And wouldn’t you enjoy a more pleasant aroma?” he said, turning to Tock. Almost immediately the dog smelled a wonderful smell that no one but he could smell. It was made up of all the marvelous things that had ever delighted his curious nose. “And here’s something I know you’ll enjoy hearing,” he assured the Humbug. The bug listened with rapt attention to something he alone could hear—the shouts and applause of an enormous crowd, all cheering for him. They each stood as if in a trance, looking, smelling, and listening to the very special things that the Senses Taker had provided for them, forgetting completely about where they were going and who, with evil intent, was coming up behind them. The Senses Taker sat back with a satisfied smile on his puffy little face as the demons came closer and closer, until less than a minute separated them from their helpless victims. But Milo was too engrossed in the circus to notice, and Tock had closed his eyes, the better to smell, and the bug, bowing and waving, stood with a look of sheer bliss on his face, interested only in the wild ovation. The little man had done his work well and, except for some ominous crawling noises just below the crest of the mountain, everything was again silent. Milo, who stood staring blankly into the distance, let his bag of gifts slip from his shoulder to the ground. And, as he did, the package of sounds broke open, filling the air with peals of happy laughter which seemed so gay that first he, then Tock, and finally the Humbug joined in. And suddenly the spell was broken. “There is no circus,” cried Milo, realizing he’d been tricked. “There were no smells,” barked Tock, his alarm now ringing furiously. “The applause is gone,” complained the disappointed Humbug. “I warned you; I warned you I was the Senses Taker,” sneered the Senses Taker. “I help people find what they’re not looking for, hear what they’re not listening for, run after what they’re not chasing, and smell what isn’t even there. And, furthermore,” he cackled, hopping around gleefully on his stubby legs, “I’ll steal your sense of purpose, take your sense of duty, destroy your sense of proportion—and, but for one thing, you’d be helpless yet.” “What’s that?” asked Milo fearfully. “As long as you have the sound of laughter,” he groaned unhappily, “I cannot take your sense of humor—and, with it, you’ve nothing to fear from me.” “But what about THEM?” cried the terrified bug, for at that very instant the other demons had reached the top at last and were leaping forward to seize them. They ran for the stairs, bowling over the disconsolate Senses Taker, ledger, ink bottle, eyeshade, and all, as they went. The Humbug dashed up first, then Tock, and lastly Milo, almost too late, as a scaly arm brushed his shoe. The dangerous stairs danced dizzily in the wind, and the clumsy demons refused to follow; but they howled with rage and fury, swore bloody vengeance, and watched with many pairs of burning eyes as the three small shapes vanished slowly into the clouds. “Don’t look down,” advised Milo as the bug tottered upward on unsteady legs. Like a giant corkscrew, the stairway twisted through the darkness, steep and narrow and with no rail to guide them. The wind howled cruelly in an effort to tear them loose, and the fog dragged clammy fingers down their backs; but up the giddy flight they went, each one helping the others, until at last the clouds parted, the darkness fell away, and a glow of golden sunrays warmed their arrival. The castle gate swung smoothly open, and on a rug as soft as a snowdrift they entered the great hall and they stood shyly waiting. “Come right in, please; we’ve been expecting you,” sang out two sweet voices in unison. At the far end of the hall a silver curtain parted and two young women stepped forward. They were dressed all in white and were beautiful beyond compare. One was grave and quiet, with a look of warm understanding in her eyes, and the other seemed gay and joyful. “You must be the Princess of Pure Reason,” said Milo, bowing to the first. She answered simply, “Yes,” and that was just enough. “Then you are Sweet Rhyme,” he said, with a smile to the other. Her eyes sparkled brightly and she answered with a laugh as friendly as the mailman’s ring when you know there’s a letter for you. “We’ve come to rescue you both,” Milo explained very seriously. “And the demons are close behind,” said the worried Humbug, still shaky from his ordeal. “And we should leave right away,” advised Tock. “Oh, they won’t dare come up here,” said Reason gently; “and we’ll be down there soon enough.” “Why not sit for a moment and rest?” suggested Rhyme. “I’m sure you must be tired. Have you been traveling long?” “Days,” sighed the exhausted dog, curling up on a large downy cushion. “Weeks,” corrected the bug, flopping into a deep comfortable armchair, for it did seem that way to him. “It has been a long trip,” said Milo, climbing onto the couch where the princesses sat; “but we would have been here much sooner if I hadn’t made so many mistakes. I’m afraid it’s all my fault.” “You must never feel badly about making mistakes,” explained Reason quietly, “as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons.” “But there’s so much to learn,” he said, with a thoughtful frown. “Yes, that’s true,” admitted Rhyme; “but it’s not just learning things that’s important. It’s learning what to do with what you learn and learning why you learn things at all that matters.” “That’s just what I mean,” explained Milo, as Tock and the exhausted bug drifted quietly off to sleep. “Many of the things I’m supposed to know seem so useless that I can’t see the purpose in learning them at all.” “You may not see it now,” said the Princess of Pure Reason, looking knowingly at Milo’s puzzled face, “but whatever we learn has a purpose and whatever we do affects everything and everyone else, if even in the tiniest way. Why, when a housefly flaps his wings, a breeze goes round the world; when a speck of dust falls to the ground, the entire planet weighs a little more; and when you stamp your foot, the earth moves slightly off its course. Whenever you laugh, gladness spreads like the ripples in a pond; and whenever you’re sad, no one anywhere can be really happy. And it’s much the same thing with knowledge, for whenever you learn something new, the whole world becomes that much richer.” “And remember, also,” added the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, “that many places you would like to see are just off the map and many things you want to know are just out of sight or a little beyond your reach. But someday you’ll reach them all, for what you learn today, for no reason at all, will help you discover all the wonderful secrets of tomorrow.” “I think I understand,” he said, still full of questions and thoughts; “but which is the most important—” At that moment the conversation was interrupted by a far-off chopping noise. With each loud blow, the entire room and everything in it shook and rattled. Down below, on the murky peak, the demons were busily cutting the stairway loose with axes and hammers and saws. Before long the whole thing collapsed with a tremendous crash and the startled Humbug leaped to his feet just in time to see the castle drifting slowly off into space. “We’re moving!” he shouted, which was a fact that had already become obvious to everyone. “I think we had better leave now,” said Rhyme softly, and Reason agreed with a nod. “But how will we get down?” groaned the Humbug, looking at the wreckage below. “There’s no stairway and we’re sailing higher every minute.” “Well, time flies, doesn’t it?” asked Milo. “On many occasions,” barked Tock, jumping eagerly to his feet. “I’ll take everyone down.” “Can you carry us all?” inquired the bug. “For a short distance,” said the dog thoughtfully. “The princesses can ride on my back, Milo can catch hold of my tail, and you can hang on to his ankles.” “But what of the Castle in the Air?” the bug objected, not very pleased with the arrangement. “Let it drift away,” said Rhyme. “And good riddance,” added Reason, “for no matter how beautiful it seems, it’s still nothing but a prison.” Tock then backed up three steps and, with a running start, bounded through the window with all his passengers and began the long glide down. The princesses sat tall and unafraid, Milo held on as tight as he could, and the bug swung crazily, like the tail on a kite. Down through the darkness they plunged, to the mountains and the monsters below. 19. The Return of Rhyme and Reason Sailing past three of the tallest peaks, and just over the outstretched arms of the grasping demons, they reached the ground and landed with a sudden jolt. “Quick!” urged Tock. “Follow me! We’ll have to run for it.” With the princesses still on his back, he galloped down the rocky trail—and not a moment too soon. For, pounding down the mountainside, in a cloud of clinging dust and a chorus of chilling shrieks, came all the loathsome creatures who choose to live in Ignorance and who had waited so very impatiently. Thick black clouds hung heavily overhead as they fled through the darkness, and Milo, looking back for just a moment, could see the awful shapes coming closer and closer. Just to the left, and not very far away, were the Triple Demons of Compromise—one tall and thin, one short and fat, and the third exactly like the other two. As always, they moved in ominous circles, for if one said “here,” the other said “there,” and the third agreed perfectly with both of them. And, since they always settled their differences by doing what none of them really wanted, they rarely got anywhere at all—and neither did anyone they met. Jumping clumsily from boulder to boulder and catching hold with his cruel, curving claws was the Horrible Hopping Hindsight, a most unpleasant fellow whose eyes were in the rear and whose rear was out in front. He invariably leaped before he looked and never cared where he was going as long as he knew why he shouldn’t have gone to where he’d been. And, most terrifying of all, directly behind, inching along like giant soft-shelled snails, with blazing eyes and wet anxious mouths, came the Gorgons of Hate and Malice, leaving a trail of slime behind them and moving much more quickly than you’d think. “FASTER!” shouted Tock. “They’re closing in.” Down from the heights they raced, the Humbug with one hand on his hat and the other flailing desperately in the air, Milo running as he never ran before, and the demons just a little bit faster than that. From off on the right, his heavy bulbous body lurching dangerously on the spindly legs which barely supported him, came the Overbearing Know-it-all, talking continuously. A dismal demon who was mostly mouth, he was ready at a moment’s notice to offer misinformation on any subject. And, while he often tumbled heavily, it was never he who was hurt, but, rather, the unfortunate person on whom he fell. Next to him, but just a little behind, came the Gross Exaggeration, whose grotesque features and thoroughly unpleasant manners were hideous to see, and whose rows of wicked teeth were made only to mangle the truth. They hunted together, and were bad luck to anyone they caught. Riding along on the back of anyone who’d carry him was the Threadbare Excuse, a small, pathetic figure whose clothes were worn and tattered and who mumbled the same things again and again, in a low but piercing voice: “Well, I’ve been sick—but the page was torn out—I missed the bus—but no one else did it— well, I’ve been sick—but the page was torn out—I missed the bus—but no one else did it.” He looked quite harmless and friendly but, once he grabbed on, he almost never let go. Closer and closer they came, bumping and jolting each other, clawing and snorting in their eager fury. Tock staggered along bravely with Rhyme and Reason, Milo’s lungs now felt ready to burst as he stumbled down the trail, and the Humbug was slowly falling behind. Gradually the path grew broader and more flat as it reached the bottom of the mountain and turned toward Wisdom. Ahead lay light and safety—but perhaps just a bit too far away. And down came the demons from everywhere, frenzied creatures of darkness, lurching wildly toward their prey. From off in the rear, the Terrible Trivium and the wobbly Gelatinous Giant urged them on with glee. And pounding forward with a rush came the ugly Dilemma, snorting steam and looking intently for someone to catch on the ends of his long pointed horns, while his hoofs bit eagerly at the ground. The exhausted Humbug swayed and tottered on his rubbery legs, a look of longing on his anguished face. “I don’t think I can—” he gasped, as a jagged slash of lightning ripped open the sky and the thunder stole his words. Closer and closer the demons loomed as the desperate chase neared its end. Then, gathering themselves for one final leap, they prepared to engulf first the bug, then the boy, and lastly the dog and his two passengers. They rose as one and— And suddenly stopped, as if frozen in mid-air, unable to move, staring ahead in terror. Milo slowly raised his weary head, and there in the horizon, for as far as the eye could see, stood the massed armies of Wisdom, the sun glistening from their swords and shields, and their bright banners slapping proudly at the breeze. For a moment everything was silent. Then a thousand trumpets sounded—then a thousand more—and, like an ocean wave, the long line of horsemen advanced, slowly at first, then faster and faster, until with a gallop and a shout, which was music to Milo’s ears, they swept forward toward the horrified demons. There in the lead was King Azaz, his dazzling armor embossed with every letter in the alphabet, and, with him, the Mathemagician, brandishing a freshly sharpened staff. From his tiny wagon, Dr. Dischord hurled explosion after explosion, to the delight of the Sound-keeper, while the busy DYNNE collected them almost at once. And, in honor of the occasion, Chroma the Great led his orchestra in a stirring display of patriotic colors. Everyone Milo had met during his journey had come to help—the men of the market place, the miners of Digitopolis, and all the good people from the valley and the forest. The Spelling Bee buzzed excitedly overhead shouting, “Charge—c-h-a-r-g-e— charge—c-h-a-r-g-e.” Canby, who, as everyone knew, was as cowardly as can be, came all the way from Conclusions to show that he was also as brave. And even Officer Shrift, mounted proudly on a long, low dachshund, galloped grimly along. Cringing with fear, the monsters of Ignorance turned in flight and, with anguished cries too horrible ever to forget, returned to the damp, dark places from which they came. The Humbug sighed with relief, and Milo and the princesses prepared to greet the victorious army. “Well done,” stated the Duke of Definition, dismounting and grasping Milo’s hand warmly. “Fine job,” seconded the Minister of Meaning. “Good Work,” added the Count of Connotation. “Congratulations,” proposed the Earl of Essence. “CHEERS,” recommended the Undersecretary of Understanding. And, since that’s exactly what everyone felt like doing, that’s exactly what everyone did. “It’s we who should thank—” began Milo, when the shouting had subsided, but, before he could finish, they had unrolled an enormous scroll. And, with a fanfare of trumpets and drums, they stated in order that: “Henceforth,” “And forthwith,” “Let it be known by all men” “That Rhyme and Reason” “Reign once more in Wisdom.” The two princesses bowed gratefully and warmly kissed their brothers, and they all agreed that a very fine thing had happened. “And furthermore,” continued the proclamation, “The boy named Milo,” “The dog known as Tock,” “And the insect hereinafter referred to as the Humbug” “Are hereby declared to be” “Heroes of the realm.” Cheer after cheer filled the air, and even the bug seemed a bit embarrassed at having so much attention paid to him. “Therefore,” concluded the duke, “In honor of their glorious deed, a royal holiday is declared. Let there be parades through every city in the land and a gala carnival of three days’ duration, consisting of jousts, games, feasts, and follies.” The five cabinet members then rolled up the large parchment and, with many bows and flourishes, retired. Swift horsemen carried the news to every corner of the kingdom, and, as the parade slowly wound its way through the countryside, crowds of people gathered to cheer it along. Garlands of flowers hung from every house and shop and carpeted the streets. Even the air shimmered with excitement, and shutters closed for many years were thrown open to let the brilliant sunlight shine where it hadn’t shone in so long. Milo, Tock, and the very subdued Humbug sat proudly in the royal carriage with Azaz, the Mathemagician, and the two princesses; and the parade stretched for miles in both directions. As the cheering continued, Rhyme leaned forward and touched Milo gently on the arm. “They’re shouting for you,” she said with a smile. “But I could never have done it,” he objected, “without everyone else’s help.” “That may be true,” said Reason gravely, “but you had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you will do.” “That’s why,” said Azaz, “there was one very important thing about your quest that we couldn’t discuss until you returned.” “I remember,” said Milo eagerly. “Tell me now.” “It was impossible,” said the king, looking at the Mathemagician. “Completely impossible,” said the Mathemagician, looking at the king. “Do you mean—” stammered the bug, who suddenly felt a bit faint. “Yes, indeed,” they repeated together; “but if we’d told you then, you might not have gone—and, as you’ve discovered, so many things are possible just as long as you don’t know they’re impossible.” And for the remainder of the ride Milo didn’t utter a sound. Finally, when they’d reached a broad, flat plain midway between Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, somewhat to the right of the Valley of Sound and a little to the left of the Forest of Sight, the long line of carriages and horsemen stopped, and the great carnival began. Gaily striped tents and pavilions sprang up everywhere as the workmen scurried about like ants. Within minutes there were racecourses and grandstands, side shows and refreshment booths, gaming fields, Ferris wheels, banners, bunting, and bedlam, almost without pause. The Mathemagician provided a continuous display of brilliant fireworks made up of exploding numbers which multiplied and divided with breath-taking results— the colors, of course, being supplied by Chroma and the noise by a deliriously happy Dr. Dischord. Thanks to the Soundkeeper, there was music and laughter and, for very brief moments, even a little silence. Alec Bings set up an enormous telescope and invited everyone to see the other side of the moon, and the Humbug wandered through the crowd accepting congratulations and recounting in great detail his brave exploits, most of which gained immeasurably in the telling. And each evening, just at sunset, a royal banquet was held. There was everything imaginable to eat. King Azaz had ordered a special supply of delicious words in all flavors and, for those who liked exotic foods, in all languages, too. The Mathemagician had provided innumerable platters of division dumplings, which Milo was very careful to avoid, for, no matter how many you ate, when you finished there was more on your plate than when you began. And, of course, following the meal came songs, epic poems, and speeches in praise of the princesses and the three gallant adventurers who had rescued them. King Azaz and the Mathemagician pledged that every year at this same time they would lead their armies to the mountains of Ignorance until not one demon remained, and everyone agreed that no finer carnival for no finer reason had ever been held in Wisdom. But even things as fine as all that must end sometime, and late on the afternoon of the third day the tents were struck, the pavilions were folded, and everything was packed ready to leave. “It’s time to go now,” said Reason, “for there is much to do.” And, as she spoke, Milo suddenly remembered his home. He wanted very much to go back, yet somehow he could not bear the thought of leaving. “And so you must say good-by,” said Rhyme, patting him gently on the cheek. “To everyone?” said Milo unhappily. He looked around slowly at all the friends he’d made, and he looked very hard so as not to forget any of them for even an instant. But mostly he looked at Tock and the Humbug, with whom he had shared so much—the perils, the dangers, the fears, and, best of all, the victory. Never had anyone had two more steadfast companions. “Can’t you both come with me?” he asked, knowing the answer as he said it. “I’m afraid not, old man,” replied the bug. “I’d like, to, but I’ve arranged a lecture tour which will keep me occupied for years.” “And they do need a watchdog here,” barked Tock sadly. Milo embraced the bug who, in his most typical fashion, was heard to mumble gruffly, “BAH,” but whose damp eyes told quite a different story. Then the boy threw his arms around Tock’s neck and, for just a moment, held on very tightly. “Thank you for everything you’ve taught me,” said Milo to everybody as a tear rolled down his cheek. “And thank you for what you’ve taught us,” said the king—and, as he clapped his hands, the little car was brought forward, polished like new. Milo got in and, with one last look, started down the road, with everyone waving him on. “Good-by,” he shouted. “Good-by. I’ll be back.” “Good-by,” shouted Azaz. “Always remember the importance of words.” “And numbers,” added the Mathemagician forcefully. “Surely you don’t think numbers are as important as words?” he heard Azaz shout from the distance. “Is that so?” replied the Mathemagician a little more faintly. “Why, if—” “Oh dear,” thought Milo; “I do hope they don’t start it all again.” And in a moment they had faded from sight as the road dipped, turned, and headed for home. 20. Good-by and Hello As the pleasant countryside flashed by and the wind whistled a tune on the windshield, it suddenly occurred to Milo that he must have been gone for several weeks. “I do hope that no one’s been worried,” he thought, urging the car on faster. “I’ve never been away this long before.” The late-afternoon sun had turned now from a vivid yellow to a warm lazy orange, and it seemed almost as tired as he was. The road raced ahead in a series of gentle curves that began to look familiar, and off in the distance the solitary tollbooth appeared, a welcome sight indeed. In a few minutes he reached the end of his journey, deposited his coin, and drove through. And, almost before realizing it, he was sitting in the middle of his own room again. “It’s only six o’clock,” he observed with a yawn, and then, in a moment, he made an even more interesting discovery. “And it’s still today! I’ve been gone for only an hour!” he cried in amazement, for he’d certainly never realized how much he could do in so short a time. Milo was much too tired to talk and almost too tired for dinner, so, without a murmur, he went off to bed as soon as he could. He pulled the covers around him, took a last look at his room—which somehow seemed very different than he’d remembered—and then drifted into a deep and welcome sleep. School went very quickly the next day, but not quickly enough, for Milo’s head was full of plans and his eyes could see nothing but the tollbooth and what lay beyond. He waited impatiently for the end of class, and when the time finally came, his feet raced his thoughts all the way back to the house. “Another trip! Another trip! I’ll leave right away. They’ll all be so glad to see me, and I’ll—” He stopped abruptly at the door of his room, for, where the tollbooth had been just the night before, there was now nothing at all. He searched frantically throughout the apartment, but it had vanished just as mysteriously as it had come— and in its place was another bright-blue envelope, which was addressed simply: “FOR MILO, WHO NOW KNOWS THE WAY.” He opened it quickly and read: Dear Milo, You have now completed your trip, courtesy of the Phantom Tollbooth. We trust that everything has been satisfactory, and hope you understand why we had to come and collect it. You see, there are so many other boys and girls waiting to use it, too. It’s true that there are many lands you’ve still to visit (some of which are not even on the map) and wonderful things to see (that no one has yet imagined), but we’re quite sure that if you really want to, you’ll find a way to reach them all by yourself. Yours truly, The signature was blurred and couldn’t be read. Milo walked sadly to the window and squeezed himself into one corner of the large armchair. He felt very lonely and desolate as his thoughts turned far away—to the foolish, lovable bug; to the comforting assurance of Tock, standing next to him; to the erratic, excitable DYNNE; to little Alec, who, he hoped, would someday reach the ground; to Rhyme and Reason, without whom Wisdom withered; and to the many, many others he would remember always. And yet, even as he thought of all these things, he noticed somehow that the sky was a lovely shade of blue and that one cloud had the shape of a sailing ship. The tips of the trees held pale, young buds and the leaves were a rich deep green. Outside the window, there was so much to see, and hear, and touch—walks to take, hills to climb, caterpillars to watch as they strolled through the garden. There were voices to hear and conversations to listen to in wonder, and the special smell of each day. And, in the very room in which he sat, there were books that could take you anywhere, and things to invent, and make, and build, and break, and all the puzzle and excitement of everything he didn’t know—music to play, songs to sing, and worlds to imagine and then someday make real. His thoughts darted eagerly about as everything looked new—and worth trying. “Well, I would like to make another trip,” he said, jumping to his feet; \\"but I really don’t know when I’ll have the time.

Gibt es performantete möglichkeiten als als array.sort((a, b) => b.count - a.count);?","output":"Wenn dein Array eine sehr große Anzahl an Objekten enthält, deren \`count\`-Werte bereits vorwiegend sortiert sind oder wenn die Werte des \`count\`-Attributs nur in einem kleinen Bereich variieren, könnten spezifische Sortieralgorithmen oder Optimierungen geeigneter sein als die direkte Anwendung von \`array.sort()\`. Allerdings wählt JavaScript unter der Haube bereits sehr effiziente Algorithmen für \`sort()\`, also sind die Verbesserungen möglicherweise marginal, außer in sehr spezialisierten Anwendungsfällen. Hier sind ein paar Ansätze und Überlegungen für effiziente Sortierungen abhängig von deinen spezifischen Daten- und Anwendungseigenschaften: 1. **Counting Sort** Für Arrays mit Objekten, bei denen der Wertebereich von \`count\` bekannt und nicht allzu groß ist, kann Counting Sort eine schnelle Alternative sein. Dieser Algorithmus ist besonders effektiv bei kleinen bis mittleren Wertebereichen für \`count\`. 2. **Bucket Sort** Wenn die \`count\`-Werte innerhalb eines bekannten Bereichs liegen und gleichmäßig verteilt sind, könnte Bucket Sort effizient sein. Dieser teilt das Array in eine feste Anzahl von Behältern auf (jeder für einen bestimmten Wertebereich) und sortiert dann die einzelnen Behälter. 3. **Optimierung bei fast sortierten Arrays** Wenn dein Array bereits teilweise sortiert ist, könnten Algorithmen wie Insertion Sort für kleine Änderungen effektiver sein als ein Vollsortierungsalgorithmus wie QuickSort oder MergeSort, die in \`array.sort()\` Anwendung finden könnten. Für den \`Counting Sort\` als Beispiel könnte die Implementierung in JavaScript so aussehen (vorausgesetzt, die \`count\`-Werte sind ganzzahlig und nicht negativ): \`\`\`javascript function countingSort(arr, maxValue) { let bucket = new Array(maxValue + 1).fill(0); let sortedIndex = 0; let arrLen = arr.length; let output = new Array(arrLen); for (let i = 0; i < arrLen; i++) { bucket[arr[i].count]++; } for (let j = 0; j < maxValue + 1; j++) { while(bucket[j] > 0) { output[sortedIndex++] = {count: j}; bucket[j]--; } } return output; } // Annahme: Maximaler Wert von count ist bekannt und nicht allzu groß let arr = [{count:1}, {count:3}, {count:2}, {count:4}, {count:2}]; let sortedArr = countingSort(arr, 4); // 4 ist hier der maximal bekannte Wert für \`count\` \`\`\` Beachte, dass bei Verwendung einer spezifischen Sortiermethode stets die Eigenschaften deiner Daten und der Anwendungsfall genau berücksichtigt werden sollten. Die primitiven JavaScript-Sortiermethoden sind bereits sehr optimiert und decken die meisten Anwendungsfälle ab. In speziellen Fällen können die oben genannten Methoden jedoch zu Leistungsverbesserungen führen."},{"instruction":"wie wäre es denn wenn ich im falle einer incrementierung eines count einrages ausgehend vom betreffenden eintrag nach oben durchlaufe bis ich einen eintrag finde der größer ist und dann den aktuellen eintrag hinter diesen verschiebe ohne weitere einträge zu beachten?","output":"Der Ansatz, den du beschreibst, klingt nach einer Optimierung für eine spezialisierte Anwendung, in der Einträge häufiger inkrementiert als hinzugefügt werden und das Array zu jedem Zeitpunkt so sortiert wie möglich gehalten werden soll. Deine Strategie ähnelt im Grunde der Idee des Einfügens mittels **Insertion Sort**, angepasst auf dynamische Updates. Die Grundidee dabei ist, dass du, sobald \`count\` für einen Eintrag erhöht wird, diesen Eintrag in der sortierten Liste an die richtige Stelle verschiebst, um die Sortierordnung beizubehalten. Hier sind die Schritte für diese Optimierung: 1. **Erhöhe \`count\` für den gewünschten Eintrag.** 2. **Verschiebe den Eintrag nach \\"oben\\" (in Richtung des Listenanfangs), bis du auf einen Eintrag triffst, dessen \`count\` größer oder gleich dem erhöhten \`count\` ist.** 3. **Füge den Eintrag hinter diesen gefundenen Eintrag ein.** Hier ein grober Code, der diese Logik in JavaScript umsetzt: \`\`\`javascript function incrementAndSort(arr, index) { // Schritt 1: Erhöhe count für den Eintrag am gegebenen Index arr[index].count += 1; // Schritt 2: Verschiebe den Eintrag an die richtige Stelle while (index > 0 && arr[index - 1].count < arr[index].count) { // Eintrag mit höherem count als der Vorherige gefunden, tausche die beiden let temp = arr[index]; arr[index] = arr[index - 1]; arr[index - 1] = temp; // Gehe einen Schritt \\"nach oben\\" weiter index -= 1; } } // Beispiel let arr = [{count:1}, {count:2}, {count:3}, {count:1}]; incrementAndSort(arr, 3); // Inkrementiere den count des Eintrags an Position 3 console.log(arr); // Erwartetes Ergebnis: [{count:1}, {count:2}, {count:2}, {count:3}] \`\`\` Bei diesem Ansatz musst du nicht das gesamte Array neu sortieren, sondern verschiebst lediglich den aktualisierten Eintrag an die richtige Position. Dies kann effizienter sein, insbesondere wenn inkrementierte Einträge nur selten eine Verschiebung notwendig machen oder wenn das Array meistens sortiert bleibt. Beachte, dass dieser Ansatz besonders gut funktioniert, wenn Änderungen im Array relativ selten sind oder wenn die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein inkrementierter \`count\` eine weitreichende Verschiebung erfordert, gering ist. In Szenarien mit sehr häufigen Updates oder großen Arrays könnten komplexe Aktualisierungsstrategien oder Datenstrukturen wie balancierte Bäume bessere Performance bieten."},{"instruction":"wenn das nächste element gleich groß ist kann man den vorgang ja beenden oder?","output":"Ja, genau. Wenn du den aktualisierten Eintrag im Array nach oben verschiebst und auf ein Element triffst, dessen \`count\` gleich dem des aktualisierten Eintrags ist, kannst du den Verschiebungsprozess beenden. Da dein Ziel ist, das Array basierend auf dem \`count\` sortiert zu halten, ist es nicht notwendig, den Eintrag weiter zu verschieben, sobald du ein Element mit einem gleich großen \`count\` gefunden hast. Der aktualisierte Eintrag ist an dieser Stelle korrekt positioniert, da die Reihenfolge zwischen Elementen mit gleichem \`count\` aus deiner Perspektive irrelevant oder austauschbar ist. Das Aktualisieren der Funktion \`incrementAndSort\`, um diesen Fall einzubeziehen, würde so aussehen: \`\`\`javascript function incrementAndSort(arr, index) { // Schritt 1: Erhöhe count für den Eintrag am gegebenen Index arr[index].count += 1; // Schritt 2: Verschiebe den Eintrag an die richtige Stelle while (index > 0 && arr[index - 1].count < arr[index].count) { // Eintrag mit höherem count als der Vorherige gefunden, tausche die beiden let temp = arr[index]; arr[index] = arr[index - 1]; arr[index - 1] = temp; // Gehe einen Schritt \\"nach oben\\" weiter index -= 1; } // Sobald du auf ein Element mit gleichem Wert triffst, kannst du aufhören, // denn eine weitere Verschiebung ist nicht nötig. } \`\`\` Durch das Beenden des Verschiebungsprozesses, sobald ein Element mit gleichem \`count\` gefunden wird, kann die Funktion effizienter gestaltet werden, insbesondere in einem Array, in dem viele Elemente denselben \`count\`-Wert haben. Dies verhindert unnötige Vergleiche und Verschiebungen, die das Ergebnis nicht ändern würden, und optimiert somit die Performance deines Sortierungsvorgangs."},{"instruction":"Make this a string: path('security-hub-controls-by-team/<teamid:team_id>', security_hub_controls_by_team_view,","output":"\\"path('security-hub-controls-by-team/<teamid:team_id>', security_hub_controls_by_team_view,\\")"},{"instruction":"{FOREST BIOME - TERRARIA} Guide: \\"[player]!

Import the class and configure it by creating a \`config.js\` file with the necessary API keys and settings. 2. Create an instance of the \`ChatGPT\` class. 3. Use the instance to handle incoming messages from users/contacts, fetching and delivering ChatGPT's responses. This makes the class a useful component for integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT functionalities into chatbots or other conversational applications, with support for maintaining context and managing error scenarios."},{"instruction":"i want to switch chatgpt to google gemini model, please help me modify this code","output":"Switching from the OpenAI ChatGPT model to Google's conversational models requires significant changes, primarily because Google's conversational AI offerings, such as LaMDA or the recently introduced Gemini, use different API endpoints and structures. As of my last update, detailed public API documentation for Gemini might not be available, or access might be restricted to certain partners or via request. Given these constraints, I'll guide you through a general approach on how you might adapt your code to switch from ChatGPT to a hypothetically accessible Google Gemini API. # Step 1: Update Dependencies First, ensure there are no dependencies specifically tied to OpenAI's API, such as \`@waylaidwanderer/chatgpt-api\`. Google's API client libraries (e.g., \`googleapis\`) should be used instead, if applicable. # Step 2: API Client Initialization Replace the ChatGPTClient initialization with Google API client setup. This often involves authenticating with Google Cloud and setting up the API client for request handling. This setup is highly dependent on the Google API's documentation and available SDKs. # Step 3: Modify the Request Handler You need to update \`getChatGPTReply\` to make requests to Google's API instead of OpenAI's. This involves changing the request payload structure and the endpoint URL according to Google's specification. # Hypothetical Changes: Let's proceed with hypothetical modifications for a Gemini-like model interaction: \`\`\`javascript import { google } from 'googleapis'; // This is hypothetical and might not directly apply to accessing a specific AI model like Gemini const googleConfig = { apiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY', // Securely store your API key // Assuming Gemini or a related model requires specific project settings or an endpoint projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID', modelEndpoint: 'GEMINI_MODEL_ENDPOINT', // This is hypothetical and subject to change }; export default class GeminiChat { constructor() { this.apiKey = googleConfig.apiKey; this.projectId = googleConfig.projectId; this.modelEndpoint = googleConfig.modelEndpoint; // Depending on the available Google APIs, initialize the client here } async getGeminiReply(prompt, sessionId) { try { const requestBody = { // Structure the request body as required by the API prompt: prompt, // sessionId might be used for maintaining context session: sessionId, // Additional parameters as per Google's documentation }; // Hypothetical POST request to Google's API endpoint // The actual implementation will vary based on the available methods in googleapis or other libraries const response = await fetch(\`{this.modelEndpoint}?key={this.apiKey}\`, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(requestBody), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Further headers as required }, }); const data = await response.json(); // Process and return the data as required by your application return data; } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching reply from Gemini:', error); throw error; // Or handle error gracefully as needed } } // Additional methods (like replyMessage) would be updated similarly to utilize \`getGeminiReply\` } \`\`\` # Caveats: - This example uses modern JavaScript fetch API for HTTP requests, assuming a Node.js environment or similar that supports \`fetch\` or using a polyfill/library like \`node-fetch\`. - Replace placeholders (\`YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\`, \`YOUR_PROJECT_ID\`, \`GEMINI_MODEL_ENDPOINT\`) with actual values obtained from Google Cloud Console and API documentation. - The real interaction with Google's model APIs (such as LaMDA, Gemini, or any conversational AI API they offer) would depend on the specifics of those APIs, including request and response structures, authentication mechanisms, and other operational details.

The code snippet also assumes a certain format for the chat history and the response from \`sendMessage\`, which you will need to adjust according to the actual data structure used by the Google Generative AI model's API. # Please Note: - The implementation details depend heavily on the actual API and SDK provided for interacting with Google's Gemini model, which was not publicly documented as of my last update. Ensure to check the official documentation or SDK examples for accurate implementations. - Make sure to handle API keys and other sensitive information securely, and don't expose them in client-side code."},{"instruction":"find me a word in 6 letters meaning : Bitcoin Payments","output":"The word you are looking for is \\"Crypto.\\""}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},G={key:1};function z(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(o(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
