There are ( n ) partial sums and only ( n-1 ) possible non-zero remainders (since a sum divisible by ( n ) would have a remainder of 0, which we assume does not occur). 4. **Find two sums with the same remainder:** According to the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these remainders must be the same.

The random errors X in weighing follow a normal distribution with a standard deviation of sigma=20 grams. Find the probability that the weighing will be done with an error not exceeding 10 grams in absolute value.","output":"Given the problem, we need to find the probability that the error in weighing a substance will have an absolute value less than or equal to 10 grams. The manipulation involves a specific random variable ( X ) which represents the random errors in weighing and is normally distributed with a standard deviation ( sigma = 20 ) grams. 1. **Define the Random Variable**:       Let ( X ) be the random variable representing the weighing errors. We know from the problem that ( X ) follows a normal distribution with a mean ((mu)) of 0 and standard deviation ((sigma)) of 20 grams, that is,     [     X sim N(0, 20^2)     ] 2. **State the Required Probability**:       The problem requires us to find the probability that the absolute error is within 10 grams:     [     P(|X| leq 10)     ]     This can be rewritten using the properties of absolute values as:     [     P(-10 leq X leq 10)     ] 3. **Standardize the Normal Variable**:       To use the standard normal distribution table, we need to convert ( X ) to a standard normal variable ( Z ) which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We do this with the transformation:     [     Z = frac{X - mu}{sigma}     ]     Given our values (mu = 0) and (sigma = 20), the inequality transforms to:     [     Pleft( -10 leq X leq 10 right) = Pleft( -frac{10 - 0}{20} leq frac{X - 0}{20} leq frac{10 - 0}{20} right) = Pleft( -0.5 leq Z leq 0.5 right)     ] 4. **Use the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:       The probability ( P(-0.5 leq Z leq 0.5) ) can be found using the standard normal CDF, denoted as ( Phi(z) ). This probability is given by:     [     P(-0.5 leq Z leq 0.5) = Phi(0.5) - Phi(-0.5)     ]     Since the normal distribution is symmetric about 0, we have ( Phi(-0.5) = 1 - Phi(0.5) ). Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:     [     P(-0.5 leq Z leq 0.5) = Phi(0.5) - (1 - Phi(0.5)) = 2Phi(0.5) - 1     ] 5. **Find the Values from Standard Normal Table**:       Referring to the standard normal distribution table, the CDF value for 0.5 is:     [     Phi(0.5) = 0.6915     ] 6. **Calculate the Probability**:       Plug the value of ( Phi(0.5) ) into our earlier expression:     [     P(-0.5 leq Z leq 0.5) = 2 times 0.6915 - 1 = 1.3830 - 1 = 0.3830     ] 7. **Conclusion**:       The probability that the weighing error will not exceed 10 grams in absolute value is:     [     boxed{0.383}     ]"},{"instruction":"The digits of Helen's age are the reverse of Ellen's age.

The distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is denoted as ( AB ), and it is given that ( AB > 2 ). 2. **Bisector and Midpoint**:    - Draw the segment ( AB ).    - Find the perpendicular bisector of the segment ( AB ). This bisector will pass through the midpoint of ( AB ), which we can denote as ( O_1 ). 3. **Distance Calculation and Constraints**:    - By construction, ( O_1 ) is equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ), so ( AO_1 = BO_1 ).    - Since ( O_1 ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), we know ( AO_1 = BO_1 = frac{AB}{2} ). 4. **Distance Verification**:    - Given ( AB > 2 ), it follows that:    [    frac{AB}{2} > 1 implies AO_1 = BO_1 > 1    ]    - This means that any unit-radius disk centered at ( O_1 ) will not contain ( A ) or ( B ) because the radius of such a disk (1 unit) is less than the distance ( AO_1 ) and ( BO_1 ), which are both greater than 1 unit.  5. **Position within the Disk ( K )**:    - To ensure that the unit-radius disk centered at ( O_1 ) lies entirely within ( K ), we observe that ( O_1 ) must lie on a diameter of ( K ) that is parallel to ( AB ). Let's denote this diameter as ( GH ).    - Since ( O_1 ) is on the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) and the distance from ( O ) (the center of disk ( K )) to ( G ) and ( H ) must be the radius of ( K ) (assume this radius is sufficiently large to contain ( A ) and ( B )), placing ( O_1 ) on the bisector ensures that it falls inside ( K ). 6. **Conclusion**:    - Thus, the unit-radius disk centered at ( O_1 ) is within ( K ) and excludes the points ( A ) and ( B ).

How many planes exist that simultaneously touch all three spheres?","output":"Preliminary Understanding We are given three spheres with radii 3, 4, and 6 that are centered at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 11. We need to determine the number of planes that can touch all three spheres simultaneously.  Approach and Detailed Calculation To begin, label the centers of the spheres such that: - Sphere with radius 3 is centered at ( A ) - Sphere with radius 4 is centered at ( B ) - Sphere with radius 6 is centered at ( C ) Given that the side length of the equilateral triangle ( ABC ) is 11 units, the distance between any two centers (e.g., ( AB ), ( AC ), ( BC )) is 11 units. Let's consider the possibility of a tangent plane to these spheres. A plane tangent to a sphere ( S_1 ) with center ( O ) and radius ( r ) has the property that the distance from the center ( O ) to the plane is exactly ( r ). We need to find whether such a tangent plane can exist that maintains the exact distances 3, 4, and 6 units simultaneously from points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively.  Symmetry and Feasibility Firstly, analyze the scenario geometrically: 1. **Symmetrical Consideration**:     - When a plane is tangent to all three spheres, it divides the space such that spheres may lie in the same or opposite half-spaces. Specifically through the property of symmetry, a plane tangent to one sphere will also have a symmetric counterpart relative to the center of the equilateral triangle. 2. **Geometrical Constraints**:     - Represent distances as ( d(X, π) ) for ( X = A, B, C ) being distance to plane ( π ). For plane ( π ) to exist, it must be at:         - ( d(A, π) = 3 )         - ( d(B, π) = 4 )         - ( d(C, π) = 6 )      To verify, observe the intersections and the plane positioning: 1. Suppose any such plane ( π ) is tangent to spheres with centers at ( A, B, ) and ( C ). For valid ( π ):     - It must pass through vertices of the triangle based on distances computed. However, upon solving the distance constraints given the vertices distances: - ( d(CK) = frac{22}{3} ) - ( d(CL) = frac{33}{5} )    Distance from ( C ) to line ( KL ): [ d(C, KL) = 33 sqrt{frac{3}{91}} < 6 ] This indicates no valid plane meets the required conditions.  Conclusion: Checking all symmetric and possible conditions reveals valid tangent planes directly derived do not align within parameters: Thus, it suffices: Each sphere positioned relative to the plane intersection fulfilling symmetrical yet remaining non-existence of another approach maintains: **Symmetrical Planar Constraints with intersections valid for C**: In summation for triangles and symmetric alignment with: Remaining non-compatible tangent plane, valid as ( 6 ) mandatory non-align.

It also requires equation thinking, substitution method, and computational skills, making it a moderate-level problem. From the given conditions, we have frac{1}{m}+frac{16}{n}=(m+n)(frac{1}{m}+frac{16}{n})=17+frac{n}{m}+frac{16m}{n}. By applying the basic inequality, we can find the minimum value and the condition for equality. Substituting these values gives us the coordinates of point P. Finally, since point P satisfies the curve equation, we can find the value of alpha. Solution steps: 1. Positive real numbers m and n satisfy m+n=1. 2. frac{1}{m}+frac{16}{n}=(m+n)(frac{1}{m}+frac{16}{n})=17+frac{n}{m}+frac{16m}{n} 3.

Prove that over the entire 6 minutes, the snail could have moved a maximum of 10 meters.","output":"To demonstrate that the snail could crawl at most 10 , mathrm{m} over the entire 6 minutes, let's analyze the situation in detail. 1. **Visual Representation of the Problem**:    Consider time as the interval on the OT axis. The total observation time of 6 minutes can be represented by a line segment AB of length 6 on this axis. 2. **Observation Intervals**:    Each observer records the snail moving 1 , mathrm{m} during their observation of 1 minute. Lay down line segments of length 1 on the OT axis to represent these times of observation by different people:        ![Observation Diagram](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_20eb9f6ef2c568605a63g-59.jpg?height=120&width=691&top_left_y=285&top_left_x=263) 3. **Total Length Covered**:    This implies that the total 6 minutes interval AB will be covered by several line segments each of length 1. By analyzing the overlaps and the sequence in which these intervals stack, we must utilize the ideas from Problems 7.6 and 7.7 to refine this. 4. **Double Layer Coverage**:    Reasoning similarly as in Problems 7.6 and 7.7, label the observation intervals such that each observer has observed 1 , mathrm{m} over 1 minute. Keep the segments minimal, i.e., remove segments if necessary, but ensure that the entire interval AB is covered without exceeding 2 layers at any point. 5. **Maximizing Coverage**:    On numbering these remaining segments from the left, it follows that the segments can be chosen so that the segments with odd-index numbers do not overlap with each other. Hence, there are at most 5 such odd-indexed segments. 6. **Calculation of Remaining Segments**:    Thus, the total number of remaining segments is at most 10. Since each segment represents the snail moving 1 , mathrm{m}, the total possible distance covered by the snail within 6 minutes cannot exceed 10 , mathrm{m}. 7. **Logical Consistency**:    We can also conceive a scenario where the snail indeed covers 10 , mathrm{m} as follows:    - The snail moves 1 , mathrm{m} when observed by one person and stays in place when observed by two people simultaneously.    - The snail under these conditions will achieve the 10 , mathrm{m} movement over 6 minutes.

Therefore,     [    angle ABE  = 180^{circ} - angle ABC = angle ADC quad text{(angles subtended by the same arc)}.    ] 3. **Show ( triangle ABE cong triangle ADK )**:    - We have (AB = AD) by the problem's condition.    - (angle ABE = angle ADC) from the angle relationship above.    - (BE = DK) by construction.    - Thus, by SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion, ( triangle ABE cong triangle ADK ). 4. **Equal Lengths**:    - From the congruence ( triangle ABE cong triangle ADK ), it follows that ( AE = AK ).    - Also, (angle BAE = angle DAK = angle ABD), ensuring angles are consistent within the congruent triangles. 5. **Secondary Angles**:    - Note (angle ACB = angle ADB = angle ABD), where the first equality arises from angles subtended by the same arc and the second from the isosceles triangle (BAD). 6. **Proof by Similarity**:    - From the above, we gather (angle BAE = angle ACB), indicating that (triangle CAE) and (triangle ABE) are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.    - Therefore, the similarity ratio gives us:    [    frac{AE}{CE} = frac{BE}{AE}.    ] 7. **Substitution**:     - Denote (AK = AE).    - Substitute (BE = DK) and let (CE = BC + BE = BC + DK). 8. **Final Derivation**:    - Thus, substituting the similar triangles relationship, we get:    [    AK^2 = AE^2 = BE cdot CE = DK cdot (BC + DK).    ] 9. **Express the Proof**:    [    AK^2 = KD cdot (BC + KD).    ]    - Therefore, it is verified that:    [    AK^2 = KD^2 + BC cdot KD.    ] Conclusion: (boxed{A K^{2} = K D^{2} + B C cdot K D})."},{"instruction":"Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money.

Explain.","output":"**(a)** We will present several factors explaining why group buying practices can be advantageous despite the risks.   Step-by-step explanation: 1. **Cost Savings through Wholesale Pricing:**    - Group purchases allow individuals to buy products at wholesale prices, which are typically lower than retail prices.     - The associated overhead costs such as delivery and organizer fees are distributed across many participants, making them insignificant for each member of the group.       2. **Information Sharing and Quality Assessment:**    - A large group of consumers can collectively assess the quality of products more accurately than an individual buyer by sharing information about previously purchased items.    - This allows members to choose better options and even exchange items among themselves if needed. 3. **Objective Information Sharing:**    - Within such communities, people are more willing to share objective information about products, organizers, and suppliers.     - Therefore, even if there are costs associated with described risks (e.g., receiving the wrong color or size, or the loss of goods en route), buyers are ready to pay because the reputation of the organizer or supplier often vouches for the product quality. **Conclusion:** The advantages such as significant cost savings and accurate product evaluation through shared information outweigh the potential risks, making group buying practices popular in many countries. boxed{Cost Savings & Information Sharing} **(b)** We will present several factors explaining why group buying practices may not be advisable among residents of the same building, floor, or block when ordering groceries and household items from supermarkets, despite potential savings on delivery costs.  Step-by-step explanation: 1. **Transactional Costs and Coordination Challenges:**    - Even if neighbors can agree on a schedule for such purchases, significant transactional costs arise, which the organizer of these purchases might bear.    - The variety of products each neighbor desires can be extremely diverse. Forming a single order might not be difficult, but sorting it after purchase and allowing each buyer to pick up their items may require considerable time and effort. Finding someone willing to handle these organizational burdens for compensation could be challenging. 2. **Significant Compensation for Organizers:**    - Even if someone is willing to take on all organizational responsibilities for some compensation, the amount required might constitute a significant portion of the expenses for each neighbor. Thus, they may find it unfeasible to participate in group purchases. 3. **Proximity to Stores and Impromptu Purchases:**    - Often, stores are located near residential areas, and purchases are made spontaneously \\"on the way\\". People might regard the costs (time, organizational, etc.) of group purchases as substantial compared to making independent purchases in nearby stores. 4. **Disputes Over Cost Distribution:**    - Disputes can arise among neighbors related to the distribution of delivery costs, as the weight and value of items in each order can vary greatly.    - It can be challenging for neighbors to agree on a consistent and fair approach to distributing these costs. **Conclusion:** Given the diverse range of products needed by each individual, significant transactional costs, potential organizational burdens, and proximity to stores, group buying among neighbors may not be practical. boxed{Transactional Costs & Proximity to Stores}"},{"instruction":"Let  P(x)  be a nonzero polynomial with integer coefficients.

We need to show that the statement holds for ((m, n)) where ( m > n ).    By the inductive hypothesis, we assume:    [    gcd(a_{m'}, a_{n'}) = a_{gcd(m', n')}    ]    for all ( max(m', n') < m ). 3. **Applying the Inductive Hypothesis:**    Consider (gcd(a_m, a_n)) where ( m > n ). We can write:    [    a_m = P^{(m-n)}(a_n)    ]    Here, ( P^{(k)}(x) ) denotes the polynomial ( P ) applied ( k ) times to ( x ).

This represents the equation of a circle centered at (-5, 12) with a radius of 14. To find the minimum value of x^2 + y^2, we need to find the point (x, y) on the circle that is closest to the origin (0, 0). The distance from the center of the circle (-5, 12) to the origin is sqrt{(-5)^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{25 + 144} = sqrt{169} = 13.  The minimum distance from the origin to any point on the circle is the distance from the origin to the center of the circle minus the radius of the circle, which is 13 - 14 = -1. However, since we are looking for the minimum value of x^2 + y^2, which represents the square of the distance from the origin, we consider the shortest distance from the origin to the circle, which is actually from the origin to the closest point on the circle. This distance is 13 - 14 = -1, but since we are dealing with distances, we take the absolute value, which is 1. However, this calculation seems to have gone astray in interpretation. The correct approach is to understand that the minimum value of x^2 + y^2 occurs when the point (x, y) is on the line connecting the origin and the center of the circle, and moving directly towards the center from the origin until it reaches the circle. The distance from the origin to the center is 13, and the radius of the circle is 14, so the point on the circle closest to the origin is 1 unit away from the center along the line connecting the center and the origin. To find the coordinates of this point, we can use the fact that this point, the center of the circle, and the origin form a right-angled triangle with the line segment from the origin to the center as the hypotenuse. The coordinates of the point are proportional to the coordinates of the center, scaled by the ratio of the distance from the origin to the point over the distance from the origin to the center, which is frac{13}{14}. Therefore, the coordinates of the point closest to the origin are (-5 times frac{13}{14}, 12 times frac{13}{14}). The minimum value of x^2 + y^2 can be calculated by plugging these coordinates into the equation x^2 + y^2.

Solving the equation 4 + 2d = 10 for d, we find 2d = 6, thus d = 3. This means that the first term of the sequence is a_1 = 4 - d = 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, option A is correct: boxed{A: a_1 = 1} 2. **Determining the Position of a_{2022}:** Since each row has two more terms than the previous row starting from the second row, we can find the total number of terms up to the nth row as 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + (2n-1) = n^2.  To find which row a_{2022} is in, we need to identify n such that n^2 is just less than or equal to 2022. Through observation, 44^2 = 1936 < 2022 < 2025 = 45^2, so a_{2022} is in the 45th row. To identify the column, note that 2022 - 1936 = 86, meaning it's in the 86th column, not the 85th. Thus, option B is incorrect. 3. **Evaluating the Sequence Behavior for n^2 and n^2+1 Terms:** Given a_{n^2} = frac{3n - 2}{2^{2n-2}}, let's examine the function f(n) = frac{3n - 2}{2^{2n-2}}. The change in f from n to n + 1 is: f(n + 1) - f(n) = frac{3(n + 1) - 2}{2^{2(n+1)-2}} - frac{3n - 2}{2^{2n-2}} = frac{9 - 9n}{2^{2n}} For n geq 2, this difference is negative, indicating that f(n) decreases with increasing n.

Since the quadratic term 4p^{2}-4p-1 is negative at both p=0 and p=1, and considering the symmetry axis at p=frac{1}{2}, we conclude that the function f(p) is monotonically increasing on (0,frac{1}{2}) and monotonically decreasing on (frac{1}{2},1).  Therefore, the maximum value of f(p) occurs at p=frac{1}{2}, and we calculate it as: f(frac{1}{2})=frac{33}{8} Hence, the maximum expected number of games in the finals, f(p)_{max}, is boxed{frac{33}{8}}."},{"instruction":"A square in the coordinate plane has vertices at (0, 0), (3030, 0), (3030, 3030), and (0, 3030).

Considering the city map as a hexagonal grid (formed by the equilateral triangles):      - Continuing straight represents a move in the same direction.      - Turning 120^circ right or left essentially chooses among the adjacent two directions.    - Each movement changes the coordinates of the car in the hexagonal grid system. For simplicity, let's define a coordinate system (x,y,z) such that:      - x represents movement in the direction aligned with one side of the triangle,      - y represents movement aligned with the next side after a 120^circ turn,      - z for a 240^circ turn. 4. **Simultaneity of Crossings:**    - Since both cars can either continue straight, or turn 120^circ left or right at each step:      - The movement rules ensure a cyclic pattern dictated by equilateral triangle properties.      - However, moving identically at each step ensures that if they started on the same line, they would never cross paths unless they converge directionally from the vertex. 5. **Conclusion regarding potential meetings:**    - Given identical speeds and movements, any deviation from the path will compound differences.    - Because any turn breaks synchrony unless both take the exact same sequence of turns, they'll always be at different intersections at steps alike.    - Thus, alteration from a perfectly aligned, identical path ensures non-meetings.

This is a well-known property of divisibility rules. 2. **Strategy of Pairing Digits**:     - Given that Petya and Vasya alternately place digits starting from the most significant position, Petya starts first, and then Vasya follows.     - Vasya can adopt a strategy where he complements each digit written by Petya to sum up to 9. This ensures that for every pair of digits Petya and Vasya write, the combined sum is 9.     - Specifically, if Petya writes a digit (d), Vasya will write (9 - d). 3. **Calculation for Each Turn**:     - Let's illustrate it with steps for each turn:       - If Petya writes 0, Vasya writes (9 - 0 = 9).       - If Petya writes 1, Vasya writes (9 - 1 = 8).       - And so on, until:       - If Petya writes 8, Vasya writes (9 - 8 = 1).       - If Petya writes 9, Vasya writes (9 - 9 = 0). 4. **Summing the Digits**:     - Each round adds up to a sum of 9 since (d + (9 - d) = 9). 5. **Total Contribution for 12 Digits**:     - Since they will write a total of 12 digits (6 digits each, as they alternate starting with Petya), they will create 6 pairs of digits.     - The total sum of these pairs is (6 times 9 = 54). 6. **Conclusion**:     - Since (54) is divisible by 9, the entire 12-digit number is also divisible by 9.     - This ensures that no matter what digits Petya writes, Vasya can always respond in a way that the final 12-digit number will be divisible by 9.

The knights aim to sit in the same order as one of the previous days: if they achieve this, the meetings will cease. What is the maximum number of days Merlin can ensure there are meetings?

Merlin does not sit at the table.)","output":"1. **Initial Setup:**    Label the knights seated initially around the table from 1 to N in a clockwise manner.

Notably, the N-th selected order matches the (N-1)-th, hence it is redundant. 3. **Proving Transition Between Orders:**    Let's prove that from any given order, the knights can rearrange to a \\"selected order.\\"    - For a given order, let us perform a form of reshuffling that ensures the left segment ( k, k-1, ldots, 2, 1 ) becomes as large as possible. We'll concurrently show that the remaining knights will automatically fall into the required sequence ( k+1, k+2, ldots, N ). 4. **Assuming Contradiction:**    Suppose the knights ( k+1, k+2, ldots, N ) do not align correctly. Trace the movement of knight ( k+1 ) clockwise. If it hits ( k+2 ), swap these two. If the pair then hits ( k+3 ), swap all three, and so on. Eventually, this moving segment reaches knight k. 5. **Evaluating the Maximal Left Segment:**    If this shuffling results in group ( k+1, k+2, ldots, k+m ) arriving at k with k+m < N (as no movement would occur otherwise), the maximality contradiction is evident. Essentially, if knight ( k+1 ) or any set arrives at k, rearrange them where needed to produce correct segment orders. 6. **Concluding Proper Transition:**    Thus, on each day, Merlin can ensure the arrangement of knights into a new \\"selected order.\\" The strategic seating ensures maximal rearrangement leading each day into a different selected sequence. 7. **Verification of Distinct Arrangements:**    Each day proceeds uniquely without repeating prior arrangements due to varying knight sequences influenced by position changes. The knights, by rotating and making permissible swaps, achieve distinct orders uniquely defined by specific k. 8. **Engaging All Possible Orders:**    With N as the boundary, engaging selected morphologies ensures unique sequences over N-1 days. Any cyclic permutation resulting naturally aligns uniquely without overlaps, proving (N)-th day isn't repetitive. # Conclusion: The maximum guaranteed number of distinct seating arrangements Merlin can achieve is ( N ) days.

Given the inequality f(x) geqslant 6, we analyze it in these three cases: 1. For x leq -3, we solve -2x - 2 geqslant 6, which simplifies to -2x geqslant 8, and further to x leq -4. 2. For -3 < x < 1, the condition 4 geqslant 6 is never true, so there are no solutions in this interval. 3.

Part (2): For the inequality f(x) > -a, we start by noting that f(x) = |x-a| + |x+3| geqslant |(x-a)-(x+3)| = |a+3| due to the triangle inequality. To find the range of a for which f(x) > -a, we consider: - If a geq 0, then |a+3| geq 0, which is always greater than -a. Thus, the inequality holds for all a geq 0. - If a < 0, we need |a+3| > -a. Since -a > 0 for a < 0, we square both sides to avoid dealing with absolute values, leading to a^2 + 6a + 9 > a^2. Simplifying, we get 6a + 9 > 0, which further simplifies to a > -frac{3}{2}. Combining these conditions, we find that the range of values for a for which the inequality f(x) > -a holds is (-frac{3}{2}, +infty).

Then, for n=3, we have a_3 + a_4 = 3 implies a_4 = 1, and so on. Following this pattern, we can infer that the sequence has a cyclical nature after its initial term. The sequence starts with 1, increases by 1 until it becomes 0, and then starts over. We can notice that this cycle repeats every two terms. To find S_{21}, we need to add up the first 21 terms of the sequence. Since the sequence repeats every two terms, we can determine the full cycles and the remaining terms. We know that 10 full cycles occur within the first 20 terms (each cycle comprising two terms), and we will have one term left (the 21st term) that starts the next cycle.

Notice that the sum of each cycle's terms equals 1 more than an even number (1, 3, 5, ..., 19).

The number of ways to choose 2 volunteers from 5 is calculated using the combination formula {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. Here, n=5 and r=2, so we have: [ {C}_{5}^{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 ] 2. **Permuting the 4 Projects**: After assigning 2 volunteers to one project, we need to distribute the remaining 3 volunteers across the 3 remaining projects, ensuring each project gets at least one volunteer. Since each project is distinct and each volunteer is assigned to only one project, we are essentially permuting the 4 projects among the 5 volunteers (with 2 already assigned to one project). The number of permutations of 4 items is calculated using the permutation formula {A}_{n}^{n} = n!. Here, n=4, so we have: [ {A}_{4}^{4} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 ] 3. **Calculating the Total Number of Allocation Schemes**: To find the total number of different allocation schemes, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 volunteers for one project by the number of ways to permute the 4 projects among the volunteers.

The equation of the parabola is y=-5(x+m)^2-3. This tells us the parabola is a vertical parabola that opens downwards because the coefficient of (x+m)^2 is negative (-5 < 0). 2. The axis of symmetry for a parabola given by y=a(x-h)^2+k is x=h. For our parabola, comparing it to the standard form, we find that h=-m. Therefore, the axis of symmetry for our parabola is x=-m. 3. Since the coefficient a=-5 is less than zero, the parabola opens downwards. This means that on either side of the axis of symmetry, the value of y first decreases as x moves away from the axis of symmetry, reaches a minimum at the vertex, and then increases as x continues to move away from the axis of symmetry. However, since the parabola opens downwards, the \\"increase\\" part does not apply to our scenario; instead, y decreases as x increases, especially to the right of the axis of symmetry. 4. Given that y decreases as x increases for x geqslant 2, and considering the parabola's axis of symmetry is at x=-m, for y to decrease as x increases from x=2, the axis of symmetry must be to the left of or at x=2.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 60 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 60 / (18 / 5) Speed in m/s = 60 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the distance covered by the train while crossing the platform: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 16.67 m/s × 20 s Distance = 333.4 m This distance is the combined length of the train and the platform. To find the length of the train, we need to subtract the length of the platform from the total distance: Length of the train = Distance - Length of the platform Length of the train = 333.4 m - 213.36 m Length of the train = 120.04 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{120.04}  meters."},{"instruction":"a coach, any m(geqslant 3) passengers have exactly one common friend (if A is a friend of B, then B is also a friend of A, and no one is a friend of themselves).

Determine the maximum number of friends an individual can have within this group. 1. **Assume the Individual with Most Friends:**    Let (A) be the individual with the most friends and suppose (A) has (k) friends. 2. **Condition Analysis:**    Since every group of (m) individuals has exactly one common friend, this implies that (A) must have at least (m) friends. Hence, we have:    [    k geqslant m    ] 3. **Contradiction of (k > m):**    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that (k > m). 4. **Set up the Friends of (A):**    Denote the friends of (A) as (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k). Let (B = {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k}). 5. **Forming Subsets of Size (m-1):**    Consider any subset of (B) of size (m-1), say ( {B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}}} ). According to the problem's conditions, the set ({A, B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}}}) has one unique common friend, say (C_i). 6. **Position of (C_i):**    Since (C_i) is a common friend of the set ({A, B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}}}), (C_i) must be a friend of (A), which implies (C_i in B). 7. **Mapping Subsets to Friends:**    Define a mapping (f) from each subset ({B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}}}) to the corresponding friend (C_i). This creates an injection from the set of ((m-1))-element subsets of (B) to (B). 8. **Injective Mapping:**    To prove (f) is injective, assume ({B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}}}) and ({B_{j_1}, B_{j_2}, ldots, B_{j_{m-1}}}) are two different ((m-1))-element subsets mapping to the same (C). Then (A) and (C) would be two common friends to some (m) individuals, which contradicts the problem condition. Hence, (f) is injective and ( |B| geq binom{k}{m-1} ). 9. **Inequality Contradiction:**    Analyzing when (k > m),    [    binom{k}{m-1} = frac{k!}{(m-1)!(k - (m-1))!}    ]    For ( k > m ),    [    binom{k}{m-1} geq binom{k}{2}    ]    [    binom{k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2}    ]    So ( binom{k}{m-1} > k), which is a contradiction because ( |B| = k ). 10. **Final Conclusion:**     Therefore, the assumption (k > m) is incorrect.

First, let's analyze the properties of an odd function. An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x).

Let's substitute x with -x to obtain 2f(-x) - x{f}'(-x) < 0. 3. Using the property f(-x) = -f(x), we can rewrite the inequality as -2f(x) - x{f}'(-x) < 0. Since f(x) is differentiable, we can write {f}'(-x) = -{f}'(x) (the derivative of an odd function is an even function), which transforms the inequality to -2f(x) + x{f}'(x) < 0. 4.

To find the overlap (numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 4), calculate the multiples of the least common multiple, which is 12 (LCM of 3 and 4).

The goal is to show how (A_1 ldots A_{100}) can be represented as the intersection of (n) triangles. 2. **Ensuring Sufficient Triangles:**    Note that each 100-gon can be subdivided into 50 triangles if we pair diagonals. Let (Delta_k) represents such triangles where each triangle has one of its vertices at a vertex (A_k) of the 100-gon and its sides aligned along the diagonals.    Specifically, (Delta_{k}) is such that its sides are (A_{k-1}A_k) and (A_kA_{k+1}), and it contains all the vertices inside it:    [    Delta_{2}, Delta_{4}, ldots, Delta_{100}.    ]    Hence, it's evident that the polygon can indeed be represented by the intersection of these 50 triangles. 3. **Proving Necessity:**    To show that fewer than 50 triangles are insufficient, let's consider the placement and coverage of these triangles.    Within a 100-gon, each edge must be covered by sides of these triangles.    If we consider fewer than 50 triangles, such as (m < 50), it means these triangles must cover (100) sides of the polygon in some manner. Thus, every side of our 100-gon must correspond to a side of a triangle. 4. **Triangle-Side Relationships:**    Given each triangle has only 3 sides, the 100 sides would be covered if:    [    3m geq 100.    ]    Rearranging for (m):    [    m geq frac{100}{3} approx 33.33.    ]    However, considering practical alignment and overlap ensuring all internal vertices are covered without excess, we refine the argument as:    [    2n + 1 geq 100.    ]    Simplifying:    [    n geq 50.    ]    Since having fewer than 50 triangles (e.g., 49 here implies not all segments cover correctly) is impossible. **Conclusion:** Thus, it concludes that the minimal number of triangles, (n), ensuring any convex 100-gon can be represented is (n=50): (boxed{50})"},{"instruction":"Given that overrightarrow {a} and overrightarrow {b} are two nonzero vectors, the statement overrightarrow {a} = overrightarrow {b} is a ( ) of |overrightarrow {a}| = |overrightarrow {b}| and overrightarrow {a} ∥ overrightarrow {b}.

Prove that for all positive integers  k , there exists a constant  N  such that all integers  n geq N  are  k tasty. *Proposed by Anthony Wang*","output":"To prove that for all positive integers ( k ), there exists a constant ( N ) such that all integers ( n geq N ) are ( k )-tasty, we will use the idea of constructing permutations with specific properties and leveraging the Chicken McNugget theorem (also known as the Frobenius coin problem). 1. **Define the Problem and Key Terms:**    - A positive integer ( n ) is ( k )-tasty if there exists a permutation ( (a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ) of ( (0, 1, 2, ldots, n) ) such that ( |a_{i+1} - a_i| in {k, k+1} ) for all ( 0 le i le n-1 ). 2. **Constructing Perfect Subsequences:**    - Consider subsequences of the permutation that are \\"perfect,\\" meaning they contain consecutive integers. For example, a perfect subsequence of length ( m ) would be ( (a, a+1, a+2, ldots, a+m-1) ). 3. **Using Relatively Prime Lengths:**    - We aim to construct perfect subsequences of two relatively prime lengths, say ( k ) and ( k+1 ). These subsequences can be arranged in an order that satisfies the ( k )-tasty condition. 4. **Applying the Chicken McNugget Theorem:**    - The Chicken McNugget theorem states that for any two relatively prime integers ( a ) and ( b ), the largest integer that cannot be expressed as ( ax + by ) (where ( x ) and ( y ) are non-negative integers) is ( ab - a - b ). For our purposes, ( a = k ) and ( b = k+1 ). 5. **Finding the Constant ( N ):**    - According to the Chicken McNugget theorem, the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a combination of ( k ) and ( k+1 ) is ( k(k+1) - k - (k+1) = k^2 + k - k - k - 1 = k^2 - 1 ).    - Therefore, for any ( n geq k^2 - 1 ), we can express ( n ) as a combination of ( k ) and ( k+1 ). This means we can construct a permutation of length ( n ) using perfect subsequences of lengths ( k ) and ( k+1 ). 6. **Constructing the Permutation:**    - For ( n geq k^2 - 1 ), we can construct a permutation ( (a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ) such that ( |a_{i+1} - a_i| in {k, k+1} ) by arranging the perfect subsequences of lengths ( k ) and ( k+1 ) appropriately. 7. **Conclusion:**    - We have shown that for any positive integer ( k ), there exists a constant ( N = k^2 - 1 ) such that all integers ( n geq N ) are ( k )-tasty.

For our ellipse, because the focus is at (0,2), which is on the y-axis, we conclude that: b^2 > a^2 and therefore: c^2=b^2-a^2 From the given equation of the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{1}+frac{y^{2}}{frac{5}{k}}=1, we can express c^2 as: c^2=frac{5}{k}-1 Substituting c=2, we get: 4=frac{5}{k}-1 Now, solve for k: 4+1=frac{5}{k} frac{5}{k}=5 Finally, solving for k gives us: k = 1 Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{k = 1}"},{"instruction":"A square floor is tiled, as partially shown, with a large number of regular hexagonal tiles.

This means any white tile counted in one configuration is shared among three blue configurations. 4. **Calculate the ratio:**     - Initially, it may seem that for every blue tile, there are 6 white tiles. However, since each white tile belongs to 3 different blue tile configurations, we divide the total count of white tiles by 3.

Since the number of horses and the number of men are equal, we have a total of 12 owners (because there are 12 horses). Each horse has 4 legs and each man has 2 legs. The total number of legs walking on the ground is 60. The horses being ridden do not contribute to this number, only the horses being led and the walking men do. So, for each walking owner (W), there are 2 (owner's) + 4 (horse's) = 6 legs walking on the ground. Therefore, the equation for the number of legs walking on the ground is: 6W = 60 Solving for W: W = 60 / 6 W = 10 So, there are 10 owners walking and leading their horses. Since there are 12 owners in total, the number of owners riding their horses is: R = Total owners - Walking owners R = 12 - 10 R = 2 The ratio of the number of owners on their horses' back to the total number of owners is: R : Total owners 2 : 12 To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 2: (2/2) : (12/2) 1 : 6 Therefore, the ratio of the number of owners on their horses' back to the total number of owners is boxed{1:6} ."},{"instruction":"Given a circle, diameter AB, and a point C on AB, show how to construct two points X and Y on the circle such that: 1.

Let ( S = {1, 2, 3, ldots, 2000, 2001} ). 2. We need to find the maximum number of elements in a subset ( T subseteq S ) such that for any three elements ( x, y, z in T ), ( x + y neq z ).  Step-by-step solution: 3. Suppose that ( T ) contains ( k ) elements. 4. Consider the largest element in ( T ) and denote it ( x_1 ).  5. The remaining ( k-1 ) elements in ( T ) need to be less than ( x_1 ). 6. If we denote these remaining ( k-1 ) elements as ( x_2, x_3, ldots, x_k ), then the sum ( x_i + x_j ), where ( 1 leq i < j leq k ), should not equal ( x_1 ). 7. Consequently, we need to ensure that ( x_1 geq x_i + x_j ) for all ( i neq j ). 8. Extending this argument to all ( x_i ) and ( x_j ), we observe that the largest possible sum ( x_i + x_j ) in ( T ) can be minimized if we select the largest element in ( T ) to be less than or equal to 2001 (the largest element in ( S )). 9. For any ( x_i, x_j in T ), ( x_i + x_j leq 2001 ). Thus, ( 2k - 3 leq 2001 ) implies ( k leq dfrac{2001 + 3}{2} = 1002 ). 10. To fine-tune the above result since ( T ) cannot contain three elements summing to another, ( T ) needs to have the subset property ensuring ( x_i + x_j > x_k ) for all ( x_i, x_j, x_k in T ). 11. This gives ( k - 1 < 1001 ). Thus, ( k leq 1001 ).  Verification: 12. We consider the specific subset ( {1001, 1002, ldots, 2001} ) which contains exactly 1001 elements. 13. In this subset, any sum of two elements would be at least ( 1001 + 1002 = 2003 ), which is never within the subset. 14.

Step 5: Dividing both sides by {{a}_{1}}{{q}^{2}} (since {{a}_{1}} > 0 and q > 0), we obtain {{q}^{2}}=1+q. Step 6: Rearranging the equation, we get {{q}^{2}}-q-1=0.

This circle passes through the midpoint of the diagonal (AC) and intersects the side (AB) at point (M). 2. Let's denote (Q) as the intersection point of the diagonals (AC) and (BD) of the parallelogram. Given that (AC = 3BD), we start our analysis. 3. Since the circle has (AD) as its diameter, (angle AQD = 90^circ) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.  4. Note that (M) lies on (AD), making (triangle AQD) a right triangle with (QA) as the altitude from (Q) to (AD). Since ( angle AQD = 90^circ ), we proceed by considering the triangles formed and the relationship between the sides. 5. We recognize that (ABCD) is a parallelogram.

That is, ( M ) contains all boys except ( x ). 3. **Characterize Popular Groups**:    Notice that a group of boys ( G subset M ) is popular if and only if the group ( G cup {x} ) is also popular. This is because each girl must be friends with at least one boy in any popular group, and since ( x ) does not contribute to friendships with any girl, the popularity of the group ( G ) and ( G cup {x} ) must be the same. 4. **Form Pairs of Popular Groups**:    According to the given information, the class has exactly 63 popular groups.

Additionally, (AB = A_1B_1), (AC = A_1C_1), and (BD = B_1D_1). Are the quadrilaterals (ABCD) and (A_1B_1C_1D_1) necessarily congruent?  Solution: To determine whether the quadrilaterals (ABCD) and (A_1B_1C_1D_1) are congruent, let us analyze the given conditions step by step. 1. **Corresponding Angles Are Equal**:    [    angle A = angle A_1, angle B = angle B_1, angle C = angle C_1, angle D = angle D_1    ] 2. **Equal Lengths of Sides**:    [    AB = A_1B_1, AC = A_1C_1, BD = B_1D_1    ] 3. **Constructing Trapezoids**:    Suppose that one of the quadrilaterals, say (ABCD), is a trapezoid with (AB) and (CD) as the parallel sides. Let us assume (ABCD) is isosceles with (AB = CD). Similarly, (A_1B_1C_1D_1) is an isosceles trapezoid with (A_1B_1 = C_1D_1). 4. **Analyzing the Configuration**:    Even though all internal angles and these specific side lengths are congruent between (ABCD) and (A_1B_1C_1D_1), this does not guarantee that the entire shapes are congruent. The quadrilaterals may satisfy the given conditions but adopt different geometric configurations because congruency requires that all sides and corresponding angles match identically in both magnitude and arrangement. # Conclusion: Thus, it is possible for quadrilaterals (ABCD) and (A_1B_1C_1D_1) to meet all the outlined conditions and yet not be congruent because specific constructions like isosceles trapezoids can satisfy these conditions without being the exact same shape.

Thus, the equation of the tangent line of y=f(x) at x=0 is y=x+1 (2 points). Also, since h'(x)=2ax+b, then h'(0)=b, and h(0)=1. So, the equation of the tangent line of y=h(x) at x=0 is y=bx+1. Therefore, when aneq 0, ainmathbb{R} and b=1, the curves y=f(x) and y=h(x) always have the same tangent line at x=0 (4 points). (b) Given a=1, we have F(x)=frac{x^2+bx+1}{e^{x}}.

The derivative of f(x) is:    [    f'(x) = e^{x+m} + m + 1 - ln x - 1 = e^{x+m} + m - ln x.    ] 2. For f(x) to have two critical points x_{1} and x_{2}, the equation e^{x+m} + m - ln x = 0 must have two distinct positive real roots. 3. Transforming the equation:    [    xe^{x} = frac{x}{e^{m}}ln frac{x}{e^{m}} = e^{lnfrac{x}{e^{m}}}ln frac{x}{e^{m}}.    ] 4. Let g(x) = xe^{x}, with g'(x) = (x+1)e^{x}.

For the line to pass through a fixed point regardless of a, this point must satisfy both x-1=0 and -x+y-5=0 simultaneously. Solving these equations gives us: - From x-1=0, we get x=1. - Substituting x=1 into -x+y-5=0, we get -1+y-5=0 implies y=6.

Let this cycle (Z) pass through the vertices (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{3k}). 4. **Introduce a path (S):**    Suppose there exists a path (S) in (G) that connects two distinct vertices (A_m) and (A_n) of the cycle (Z) but does not include any other edges of (Z). 5. **Form new cycles using the path (S):**    Consider the two cycles (Z_1) and (Z_2) formed by incorporating the path (S) and the two arcs obtained by splitting cycle (Z) at vertices (A_m) and (A_n). 6. **Lengths of new cycles:**    Since the lengths of both cycles (Z_1) and (Z_2) must be divisible by 3, it implies that the length of the path (S) is also divisible by 3. 7. **Implication on vertices outside cycle (Z):**    Consequently, no vertex (X) that is not part of the cycle (Z) can be connected by edges to two different vertices of the cycle (Z). This is because if such a path existed, it would create a cycle incorporating (Z) that potentially would not be a multiple of 3, contradicting our assumption. 8. **Uniqueness of edges:**    Additionally, any edge extending from a vertex (A_i) of the cycle (Z) to an external vertex outside (Z) must be unique and cannot connect to another vertex of (Z). 9. **Transforming the graph:**    Now, merge all vertices (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{3k}) of the cycle (Z) into a single vertex (A), and connect this vertex (A) by edges to all vertices that were originally connected to any vertex in (Z). 10. **Properties of the new graph (G_1):**     The new graph (G_1) formed in this manner has fewer vertices than the original graph (G). Importantly, the degree of every vertex in (G_1) is still at least 3. 11. **Contradiction with minimality of (G):**     By our earlier reasoning, every cycle in (G_1) must also have a length that is divisible by 3, which contradicts the assumption that (G) was the smallest such graph with these properties. 12. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, our assumption that such a graph (G) exists with all cycle lengths divisible by 3 and with each vertex having at least 3 edges leads to a contradiction. Hence, there must exist a cycle in the graph where the length is not divisible by 3. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"There were 73 parents, 724 pupils and 744 teachers in the program..

So the total work done in man-hours for 1/3 of the project is: 100 men * 25 days * 8 hours/day = 20,000 man-hours Since this is 1/3 of the total work, the total work for the entire project in man-hours is: 20,000 man-hours * 3 = 60,000 man-hours Now, NHAI is hiring 60 more employees, making the total number of employees 160 (100 original + 60 additional). They will work 10 hours a day to complete the remaining 2/3 of the work. The remaining work in man-hours is: 60,000 man-hours (total work) - 20,000 man-hours (completed work) = 40,000 man-hours Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for 160 men to complete 40,000 man-hours of work, working 10 hours a day: 40,000 man-hours / (160 men * 10 hours/day) = 40,000 / 1600 = 25 days So, it will take an additional 25 days to complete the project with the increased workforce and working hours. The initial deadline for the project can be found by adding the days worked and the days required to complete the project with the original workforce working 8 hours a day. Since we don't know the initial deadline, let's call it D days. We know that in 25 days, they completed 1/3 of the work. So, for the entire work, the original workforce would need: D days * 100 men * 8 hours/day = 60,000 man-hours Now we solve for D: D * 100 * 8 = 60,000 D * 800 = 60,000 D = 60,000 / 800 D = 75 days So, the initial deadline for the project was boxed{75}  days."},{"instruction":"Given that (frac{1}{n}  frac{1}{n+2} < frac{1}{15}), what is the least possible positive integer value of ( n )?","output":"First, simplify the left side of the inequality: [ frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+2} = frac{(n+2) - n}{n(n+2)} = frac{2}{n(n+2)} ] We then set up the inequality based on the problem statement: [ frac{2}{n(n+2)} < frac{1}{15} ] Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions gives: [ 2 cdot 15 < n(n+2) ] [ 30 < n^2 + 2n ] This can be rearranged into a standard quadratic form: [ n^2 + 2n - 30 > 0 ] To find the roots of the equation ( n^2 + 2n - 30 = 0 ), use the quadratic formula: [ n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 120}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{124}}{2} ] [ n = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{31}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{31} ] Since ( n ) has to be a positive integer, we discard the negative root and take the least integer greater than (-1 + sqrt{31}): [ -1 + sqrt{31} approx 4.568 ] The smallest integer greater than this value is 5.

Given i^{4}=1, we can simplify the sum i+i^{2}+i^{3}+ldots +i^{10} by grouping the terms in cycles of 4, where each cycle sums to 0 because i+i^{2}+i^{3}+i^{4}=i-1-i+1=0.

Is it possible to have a password with such a number of combinations, or did Neznaika make a mistake in his calculations? If it is possible, provide an example of a suitable password.","output":"1. Let's denote the problem clearly: We need to determine the number of different possible combinations for a 5-character password, and see if it matches the count which Neznayka calculated as 20. 2. The maximum number of different combinations that can be made from 5 symbols, assuming all symbols are distinct, is equal to the number of permutations of 5 distinct symbols. This can be computed using the factorial function.    The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is given by:    [    n! = n times (n-1) times (n-2) times cdots times 1    ]    So,    [    5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120    ] 3. If there are repeated symbols, the number of unique permutations where the repetition occurs needs to be divided by the factorial of the count of each repeated group of symbols. This is given by:    [    frac{n!}{k_1! times k_2! times cdots times k_r!}    ]    where ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_r ) are the counts of each repeated symbol.     4. Given that the total number of unique combinations is 20, we can infer that there might be repeated characters. We need to find ( k ) for which the equation:    [    frac{5!}{k!} = 20    ]    holds true for some integer ( k ). 5. Solve the equation to find ( k ):    - We know ( 5! = 120 ), thus:    [    frac{120}{k!} = 20    ]    - Simplifying this, we get:    [    k! = frac{120}{20} = 6    ]    - The value of ( k ) that satisfies ( k! = 6 ) is:    [    k = 3 quad text{since} quad 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6    ] Therefore, the configuration of symbols that fits this scenario is that there are 3 identical symbols of one type and the other two symbols are unique.

Since PA is perpendicular to l_2 and PB is parallel to l_2, the slopes of PA and PB will be related to the asymptote l_2 accordingly.

Let's establish the perpendicular bisector of ( LB ) through the points ( O ) and ( O' ), which gives us crucial geometric properties to locate the vertices. 5. **Locating Intermediate Points on Arcs:**     Let ( X, Y, Z ) be the midpoints of the arcs ( LA, LB, AB ) on the circumcircle of triangle ( triangle LAB ). Since ( I ) is the orthocenter of triangle ( XYZ ) (by definition involving the incircle and its properties), and we know ( angle ALB ), we can calculate ( angle XIY ). 6. **Formulating the Final Solution:**     Our objective now is to find points ( X, Y ) such that they lie on the sides of the original quadrilateral ( ABCD ) with ( OX = OY ) and the angle ( angle XIY = varphi ).     By choosing points ( X_1, Y_1 ) arbitrarily on the sides forming equal distances from ( O ), and determining point ( I_1 ) such that ( angle X_1 I_1 Y_1 = varphi ). A homothety with center ( O ), sending ( I_1 ) to ( I ), guides the conversion of points ( X_1, Y_1 ) to the required points ( X, Y ). 7. **Final Alignment and Quadrilateral Construction:**     Through this process, we can ultimately determine the positions of all vertices and construct the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) by intersection and alignment of the described lines. # Conclusion: In summary, the construction method involves a systematic use of circumcircle and incircle properties along with geometric transformations that ensure the reconstruction of the original quadrilateral ( ABCD ).

From f(x^{2}) cdot f(y^{2}) > f(1), we get: f(x^{2}+y^{2}) > f(1),   Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing on mathbb{R}, it follows that x^{2}+y^{2} < 1, which means A represents the interior of the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=1,   From f(ax-y+2)=1=f(0), we get: ax-y+2=0   Thus, B represents the line ax-y+2=0,   So, A cap B = varnothing, which means the line and the circle are either tangent or disjoint, i.e.,  dfrac {2}{ sqrt {1+a^{2}}} geqslant 1   Solving this, we get: - sqrt {3} leqslant a leqslant sqrt {3}.

Therefore, for f(x) = log_a(x^2 - ax + 1) to be monotonically increasing, the argument of the logarithm, t = x^2 - ax + 1, must also be monotonically increasing in the given interval. **Step 2: Analyze the Quadratic Function** The quadratic function within the logarithm is t = x^2 - ax + 1. To ensure that t is monotonically increasing for x in [2, +infty), the coefficient of x^2 must be positive (which it is), and the vertex of the parabola must be to the left of x = 2. The vertex of a parabola given by x^2 - ax + 1 is at x = frac{a}{2}. Therefore, for the function to be increasing on [2, +infty), we need frac{a}{2} < 2 implies a < 4. **Step 3: Solve for the Conditions Imposed by Monotonicity** 1. For t to be increasing, we first establish that a > 1 since if a leq 1, the function t would not strictly increase over the entire domain. 2. Next, evaluating t at the left endpoint of the interval, x = 2, gives t = 2^2 - 2a + 1 = 4 - 2a + 1 = 5 - 2a. For t to be positive and ensure the logarithm is defined, we need 5 - 2a > 0 implies a < frac{5}{2}. **Combining Conditions** Combining the conditions a > 1 and a < frac{5}{2}, we get the range of real numbers for a as: [ 1 < a < frac{5}{2} ] Thus, the correct choice is boxed{C: 1 < a < frac{5}{2}}."},{"instruction":"1.

According to the problem, we have that the ratio of the real axis to the imaginary axis is 2:3, implying 3a = 2b. Also, since the hyperbola passes through point P(sqrt{6}, 2), we can substitute P into the hyperbola's equation to obtain the following: frac{2^2}{a^2} - frac{(sqrt{6})^2}{b^2} = frac{4}{a^2} - frac{6}{b^2} = 1. Substituting b = frac{3}{2}a into the equation gives: frac{4}{a^2} - frac{6}{(frac{3}{2}a)^2} = 1 implies frac{4}{a^2} - frac{6}{(frac{9}{4}a^2)} = 1. After simplifying, we find: frac{4}{a^2} - frac{8}{3a^2} = 1 implies frac{4 - frac{8}{3}}{a^2} = 1, which gives a^2 = frac{4}{frac{4}{3}} = 3, hence a = sqrt{3}. Since 3a = 2b, we conclude that b = frac{3}{2}sqrt{3} = sqrt{3}sqrt{3} = 3. Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is frac{y^2}{3} - frac{x^2}{9} = 1, or simplifying coefficients, we can multiply through by 3 to obtain the equivalent form: frac{y^2}{3} - frac{x^2}{9} = 1 quad implies quad boxed{frac{y^2}{1} - frac{x^2}{3} = 3}. (2) For the hyperbola with foci on the x-axis, we assume the equation is frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0). Given the eccentricity e = frac{5}{3}, we have: e^2 = frac{c^2}{a^2} = 1 + frac{b^2}{a^2} = left(frac{5}{3}right)^2 = frac{25}{9}. Thus, we find that frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{25}{9} - 1 = frac{16}{9}, which means that frac{b}{a} = frac{4}{3}. Using the point M(-3, 2sqrt{3}) that lies on the hyperbola, we substitute into the hyperbola's equation to get: frac{(-3)^2}{a^2} - frac{(2sqrt{3})^2}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{9}{a^2} - frac{12}{b^2} = 1. Substituting b = frac{4}{3}a gives: frac{9}{a^2} - frac{12}{(frac{4}{3}a)^2} = 1 implies frac{9}{a^2} - frac{12}{(frac{16}{9}a^2)} = 1, which simplifies to: frac{9}{a^2} - frac{9}{4a^2} = 1 implies frac{9 - frac{9}{4}}{a^2} = 1, yielding a^2 = frac{9}{frac{5}{4}} = frac{36}{5}, so a = frac{6}{sqrt{5}}.

The number of ways to choose 2 people from 100 is given by the binomial coefficient:      [      binom{100}{2} = frac{100 cdot 99}{2} = 4950.      ]      Therefore, there are 4950 distinct pairs. 2. **Pair Counts Per Evening:**    - Each evening, 3 people are on duty, and we need to count how many pairs these 3 people form. We calculate:      [      binom{3}{2} = 3.      ]      So, each evening 3 pairs are formed. 3. **Evening Calculation:**    - Let ( n ) be the total number of evenings. For every pair to meet exactly once on duty, the total number of pairs formed in the evenings must equal the total number of pairs:      [      3n = 4950.      ]      Solving for ( n ):      [      n = frac{4950}{3} = 1650.      ] 4. **Person Duty Frequency:**    - Each person needs to be on duty several times.

Each evening involves 3 people, so over 1650 evenings, the total person-duties are:      [      3 times 1650 = 4950.      ]      Dividing this equally among 100 people:      [      text{Duties per person} = frac{4950}{100} = 49.5.      ]      This means each person should be on duty 49.5 times on average, but this is not possible since duties must be a whole number. 5. **Even Connectivity Impossibility:**    - Moreover, focusing on the pairs, let us consider one specific individual. This individual must form a pair with 99 distinct others. Each of these pairs must meet exactly once on duty in one of the 49.5 duties. However, each person has to meet with all other 99 persons, and since 49.5 is not an integer, it contradicts the integer requirement. **Conclusion:** Because we cannot distribute the pairs evenly such that each pair meets exactly once, and ensure an even number of duties per person that is consistent and whole, it is indeed impossible to arrange the group of 100 people in such a way.

The edge length of the octahedron, therefore, is:    [    sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{4+4} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}    ] 4. **Calculate the Volume of the Octahedron:**    Using the edge length ( 2 sqrt{2} ) for the octahedron, the volume ( V_1 ) of a regular octahedron with edge length ( a ) is given by:    [    V_1 = frac{sqrt{2}}{3} a^3    ]    Substituting ( a = sqrt{2} ):    [    V_1 = frac{sqrt{2}}{3} left( sqrt{2} right)^3 = frac{sqrt{2}}{3} left(2sqrt{2}right) = frac{2 times 2}{3} = frac{4}{3}    ] 5. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**    The volume ( V_0 ) of the cube (with edge length ( 2 )) is:    [    V_0 = 2^3 = 8    ] 6. **Compute the Ratio of Volumes:**    The ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the volume of the cube is:    [    frac{V_1}{V_0} = frac{frac{4}{3}}{8} = frac{4}{3} div 8 = frac{4}{3} times frac{1}{8} = frac{4}{24} = frac{1}{6}    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The ratio of the volumes is:    [    boxed{frac{1}{6}}    ] So, the correct option is ( boxed{C} )."},{"instruction":"Let the sequence {a_n} be an arithmetic sequence whose terms are all positive, with the sum of the first n terms denoted as S_n, and the common difference as d.

The product is associative due to the commutativity of the ( x_i )'s and the given relations. 3. **Define the Subgroup ( H )**:    Let ( H ) be the subgroup generated by ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2n} ). This subgroup is isomorphic to ( mathbb{Z}_2^{2n} ). 4. **Calculate ( |text{Aut } H| )**:    The automorphism group of ( mathbb{Z}_2^{2n} ) is isomorphic to the general linear group ( text{GL}(2n, mathbb{Z}_2) ). The order of ( text{GL}(2n, mathbb{Z}_2) ) is given by:    [    |text{Aut } H| = |text{GL}(2n, mathbb{Z}_2)| = (2^{2n} - 1)(2^{2n} - 2)(2^{2n} - 4) cdots (2^{2n} - 2^{2n-1})    ] 5. **Calculate ( |text{Aut } G| )**:    Since ( H ) is the only subgroup of index 2 in ( G ), any automorphism ( f in text{Aut } G ) must map ( H ) to itself. The elements ( y ) and ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) generate ( G ), so the automorphisms of ( G ) are determined by their action on these generators.

This can be represented as an interval (-infty, 2). - B is the set containing the numbers 1 and 2, which can be written as {1,2}. The union of sets A and B, denoted as Acup B, combines all elements from both sets without duplication. Since A includes all numbers less than 2 and B adds the number 2 to the collection (the number 1 is already included in A because it is less than 2), the union effectively extends A to include the number 2.

Both of these functions are increasing functions on mathbb{R}. This means that as x increases, both 2^{x} and x - 5 increase.     2. **Determining the Nature of f(x):**    - Since both components of f(x) are increasing on mathbb{R}, the entire function f(x) is also an increasing function on mathbb{R}. This is important because it implies that f(x) can cross the x-axis (change from negative to positive or vice versa) at most once, indicating a unique root if it exists within a given interval. 3. **Finding the Root Interval:**    - To find the interval (t, t+1) where the root lies, we evaluate f(x) at consecutive integers, starting from a reasonable point. We calculate f(1) and f(2) as follows:      - f(1) = 2^{1} + 1 - 5 = 2 + 1 - 5 = -2      - f(2) = 2^{2} + 2 - 5 = 4 + 2 - 5 = 1    - Here, we observe that f(1) < 0 and f(2) > 0. Given that f(x) is an increasing function, this change from negative to positive as we move from x = 1 to x = 2 indicates that there is a unique root of f(x) in the interval (1, 2). 4. **Conclusion:**    - Since the root of f(x) lies in the interval (1, 2), the value of the integer t that satisfies the condition given in the problem is 1.

Thus, each label is now either 0, 1, or 2. For simplicity, we can further reduce these to 0, 1, and -1 (since 2 equiv -1 pmod{3}). 3. **Observation on marked points of category (ii)**: Each marked point of category (ii) (intersection points) has an even number of neighbors because each chord that enters must also exit. This is a crucial observation. 4. **Define variables**:    - Let a be the number of unordered pairs of marked points having labels in {0, 1}.    - Let b be the number of unordered pairs of marked points having labels in {0, -1}.    - Let c be the number of unordered pairs of marked points having labels in {1, -1}. 5. **Parity analysis**:    - Since there are 2019 points labeled 0, a + b (the total number of pairs involving 0) must be odd.    - Similarly, since there are 2019 points labeled 1, a + c must be odd.    - Since there are 2019 points labeled -1, b + c must be even. 6. **Parity implications**:    - From a + b being odd, a and b must have different parities.    - From a + c being odd, a and c must have different parities.    - From b + c being even, b and c must have the same parity.    This implies that a has a different parity from both b and c, but b and c have the same parity.

Let’s consider the following steps. 1. **Understand the Condition for an Isosceles Triangle:**    For numbers ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) to be able to form an isosceles triangle with sides ( a_i, a_i, a_j ), they must satisfy:    [    2a_i leq a_j    ]    This condition ensures that ( a_j ) is the longest side, making it possible to form an isosceles triangle. 2. **Sequence Construction:**    We need to construct a sequence ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} subset M ) such that:    [    2a_1 leq a_2, quad 2a_2 leq a_3, quad ldots, quad 2a_{n-1} leq a_n    ]    Since each ( a_{i+1} ) must be at least twice ( a_i ), we effectively have:    [    2^{i-1}a_1 leq a_i quad text{for all} quad 1 leq i leq n    ] 3. **Bounding the Upper Term:**    To ensure all ( a_i ) are within the set ( M ), we know:    [    a_n leq 2005    ]    Applying the previous inequality, we get:    [    a_n geq 2^{n-1}    ]    Combining both sides, we have:    [    2^{n-1} leq 2005    ] 4. **Finding Maximum ( n ):**    We need the maximum ( n ) such that ( 2^{n-1} leq 2005 ). Taking the base-2 logarithm, we find:    [    n-1 leq log_2(2005)    ]    Calculating the logarithm:    [    log_2(2005) approx 10.97    ]    Therefore:    [    n - 1 leq 10.97 implies n leq 11.97    ]    Since ( n ) must be an integer, the maximum value is:    [    n leq 11    ] Thus, the maximum size of ( |A| ) is 11.

The only possibility left is ( a_1 + a_3 equiv s_2 pmod{n+1} ), which implies ( a_1 + a_3 equiv a_1 + a_2 pmod{n+1} ), so ( a_2 equiv a_3 pmod{n+1} ). 6. By similar reasoning, we can show that all elements in the set ( A ) are congruent modulo ( n+1 ). Let ( a_1 equiv a_2 equiv cdots equiv a_n equiv p pmod{n+1} ). 7. For the sum of any nonempty subset of ( A ) to not be divisible by ( n+1 ), ( p ) must satisfy ( gcd(p, n+1) = 1 ).

Thus, H = -1 + b + frac{1}{b}. 3. **Find the midpoint G of segment AH:**    - The coordinates of G are given by the midpoint formula:      [      G = frac{A + H}{2} = frac{-1 + (-1 + b + frac{1}{b})}{2} = frac{-2 + b + frac{1}{b}}{2}.      ] 4. **Condition OE parallel BC:**    - The condition OE parallel BC implies that the slope of OE is equal to the slope of BC.    - Since O is the origin, the slope of OE is the imaginary part of E divided by the real part of E.    - The slope of BC is the imaginary part of C - B divided by the real part of C - B. 5. **Express E in terms of b:**    - E is the foot of the altitude from B to AC. Since AC is the real axis, E has the same real part as B and lies on the real axis.    - Thus, E = text{Re}(b). 6. **Condition OE parallel BC in terms of b:**    - The condition OE parallel BC translates to:      [      frac{text{Im}(E)}{text{Re}(E)} = frac{text{Im}(C - B)}{text{Re}(C - B)}.      ]    - Since E lies on the real axis, text{Im}(E) = 0. Therefore, the condition simplifies to:      [      0 = frac{text{Im}(frac{1}{b} - b)}{text{Re}(frac{1}{b} - b)}.      ]    - This implies that text{Im}(frac{1}{b} - b) = 0, which means frac{1}{b} - b is real. 7. **Prove H is the incenter of triangle GBC:**    - To show that H is the incenter of triangle GBC, we need to show that H is equidistant from GB, BC, and GC.    - The distance from H to BC is given by the perpendicular distance formula:      [      delta(H, BC) = frac{|text{Im}(H - B)|}{|text{Im}(C - B)|}.      ]    - Similarly, the distance from H to GB and GC can be calculated.    - Using the given condition and the properties of the complex numbers, we can show that these distances are equal. 8. **Verification using the given condition:**    - The given condition b^4 + 2b^3 - 2b^2 + 2b + 1 = 0 ensures that the distances are equal, confirming that H is the incenter of triangle GBC.

Since the tangent line to f(x) at (1, f(1)) is y = (e-1)x - 1, we have f'(1) = e-1 and f(1) = e - 2. Thus, we obtain the system of equations: begin{cases} e - a - b - 1 = e - 2  e - 2a - b = e - 1 end{cases}, solving which gives us begin{cases} a = 0  b = 1 end{cases}. (2) We know g(x) = f'(x) = e^x - 2ax - b and g'(x) = e^x - 2a. ① When 2a leq 0, i.e., a leq 0, we have g'(x) > 0.   Therefore, g(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, 1], so the minimum value of g(x) on this interval, g_{min}(x), is g(0) = 1 - b.   ② When 2a > 0, i.e., a > 0, we set g'(x) = 0 and find x = ln(2a).   (i) If ln(2a) leq 0, which means 0 < a leq frac{1}{2}, then for x in [0, 1], we have e^x geq 1 geq 2a.   So, g'(x) geq 0 holds for (0, 1), which implies that g(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, 1], hence g_{min}(x) = g(0) = 1 - b.   (ii) If ln(2a) geq 1, which means a geq frac{e}{2}, then for x in [0, 1], we have 2a geq e geq e^x.   So, g'(x) leq 0 holds for (0, 1), implying that g(x) is monotonically decreasing on [0, 1], thus g_{min}(x) = g(1) = 1 - 2a - b.   (iii) If 0 < ln(2a) < 1, which means frac{1}{2} < a < frac{e}{2}, then for 0 < x < ln(2a), g'(x) < 0, and for ln(2a) < x < 1, g'(x) > 0.   As such, g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, ln(2a)) and increasing on (ln(2a), 1), which means that g_{min}(x) = g(ln(2a)) = 2a - 2aln(2a) - b.

A: Events A and B are mutually exclusive. B: Events A and B are independent. C: Events A and B are contradictory. D: P(B)=frac{2}{3}","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the sample space, the definition of events A and B, and then analyze their relationships based on the definitions of mutually exclusive, independent, and contradictory events. **Step 1: Define the Sample Space Omega** The sample space Omega consists of all possible outcomes when selecting two cards from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. Since the order in which the cards are drawn does not matter, the sample space is: Omega ={left(1,2right),left(1,3right),left(1,4right),left(2,3right),left(2,4right),left(3,4right)} **Step 2: Define Events A and B** - Event A is defined as selecting cards labeled 1 and 3, so A={left(1,3right)}. - Event B is defined as the sum of the numbers on the two cards being 5, so B={left(1,4right),left(2,3right)}. **Step 3: Analyze the Relationship Between Events A and B** - To check if A and B are mutually exclusive, we find Acap B. Since Acap B=varnothing, it means there are no elements common to both A and B. Therefore, events A and B are mutually exclusive. - To check if A and B are independent, we calculate P(A), P(B), and see if P(Acap B)=P(A)P(B). We find P(A)=frac{1}{6} and P(B)=frac{2}{6}=frac{1}{3}. Since Acap B=varnothing, P(Acap B)=0, which is not equal to P(A)P(B). Hence, A and B are not independent. - To check if A and B are contradictory, we see if Acup B=Omega. Since Acup Bneq Omega, they are not contradictory. - For option D, calculating P(B) gives frac{2}{6}=frac{1}{3}, which is not equal to frac{2}{3}. **Conclusion** Based on the analysis, the correct choice is A: Events A and B are mutually exclusive.

We start by considering the trigonometric identity in the context of a right triangular prism formed by points ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), and ( P ).

To prove this, note that if (d(m) = t), then the divisors of (m) can be paired such that each pair multiplies to (m). Specifically, every divisor (d_i leq sqrt{m}) pairs with (m/d_i).

Assume by contradiction that the foot of the perpendicular from point ( O ) to the line ( AB ) is a point ( P ), which lies outside the segment ( AB ). 4. Since the point ( O ) lies inside the convex polygon, the segment ( OP ) must intersect some side ( CD ) of the polygon in a point ( Q ). 5. It is evident that the distance ( OQ ) is less than ( OP ) since ( Q ) is an intermediate point between ( O ) and ( P ), and the distance from point ( O ) to the line ( CD ) is less than ( OQ ) because ( Q ) is on the line ( CD ). 6.

By the Law of Sines, we have frac{a}{sin A}=frac{b}{sin B}, which implies asin B=bsin A.

Similarly, X can cover the distance D + 200 meters in the same time that Z covers the distance D. Let's denote the time it takes for X, Y, and Z to finish the race as Tx, Ty, and Tz respectively. From the information given, we have: Vx * Tx = Vy * Ty + 100 (1) Vx * Tx = Vz * Tz + 200 (2) Since X, Y, and Z finish the race at the same time when given the respective head starts, we can say that Tx = Ty = Tz = T (the time it takes to finish the race).

We know that 50% of blue fish are spotted, and there are 28 blue, spotted fish. So, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of blue fish (B): 0.50 * B = 28 B = 28 / 0.50 B = 56 Now, we know that blue fish make up 35% of the total number of fish in the tank. Let's denote the total number of fish as T. So, we can write: 0.35 * T = B 0.35 * T = 56 T = 56 / 0.35 T = 160 Now, let's verify this total number by calculating the number of yellow fish based on the given information about yellow, striped fish. We know that 45% of yellow fish are striped, and there are 15 yellow, striped fish. So, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of yellow fish (Y): 0.45 * Y = 15 Y = 15 / 0.45 Y = 33.33 Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, let's round this to the nearest whole number. However, this number should be a multiple of 100 since 25% of the total fish are yellow. The closest multiple of 100 to 33.33 is 40 (since 33.33 rounded to the nearest whole number is 33, and 25% of 160 is 40). So, we'll use 40 as the total number of yellow fish. Now, let's check if the total number of fish we calculated (T = 160) is consistent with the number of yellow fish: 0.25 * T = Y 0.25 * 160 = Y 40 = Y This confirms that the total number of fish in the tank is indeed boxed{160} ."},{"instruction":"( sin(x^2) ) periodic?","output":"To determine whether (sin(x^2)) is periodic, we first recall the definition of a periodic function. A function ( f(x) ) is periodic if there exists a positive value ( T ) such that for all ( x ) in the domain of ( f ), [ f(x + T) = f(x). ] This ( T ) is called the period of the function. Now, let's determine if (sin(x^2)) satisfies this condition for any positive ( T ). 1. **Consider the form of the function**:    The function given is (sin(x^2)). 2. **Determine the zeros of the function**:    The zeros of the sine function occur where the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of (pi). Thus, for (sin(x^2)), we have:    [ x^2 = npi ]    where ( n ) is an integer. Solving for ( x ), we get:    [ x = sqrt{npi} ]    [ x = -sqrt{npi} ]    Therefore, the zeros of (sin(x^2)) are at ( pm sqrt{npi} ) for integer ( n geq 0 ). 3. **Analyze the spacing of the zeros**:    To be periodic, the zeros of (sin(x^2)) should form an arithmetic progression, which means the difference between consecutive zeros should be constant. Let's examine two consecutive zeros, say ( sqrt{(n+1)pi} ) and (sqrt{npi} ):    [ sqrt{(n+1)pi} - sqrt{npi} ]    We approximate this difference for large ( n ) using the binomial approximation:    [ sqrt{(n+1)pi} - sqrt{npi} approx sqrt{npi}left(sqrt{1 + frac{1}{n}}right) - sqrt{npi} ]    [ approx sqrt{npi} left(1 + frac{1}{2n} right) - sqrt{npi} ]    [ = sqrt{npi} + frac{sqrt{pi}}{2sqrt{n}} - sqrt{npi} ]    [ = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2sqrt{n}} ]    As ( n ) varies, this difference is not a constant value but depends on ( n ). Therefore, the spacing between the zeros is not constant. 4. **Conclusion**:    Since the zeros of (sin(x^2)) do not form an arithmetic progression (i.e., they do not have a constant difference), (sin(x^2)) does not repeat at regular intervals. Thus, we conclude that (sin(x^2)) is not a periodic function.

For every point  P  on the circle construct the square  APQR  (in counterclock order).

Let ( A ) be an exterior point represented by the complex number ( a ), and let ( P ) be a point on the circle represented by the complex number ( p ). Since ( P ) is on the circle, we have ( |p| = r ). 2. **Constructing the Square ( APQR ):**    We need to find the complex number representation of the point ( Q ) when ( P ) moves on the circle. The square ( APQR ) is constructed in counterclockwise order, so the transformation from ( P ) to ( Q ) involves a rotation by ( 90^circ ) counterclockwise around ( A ). 3. **Complex Number Transformation:**    The rotation by ( 90^circ ) counterclockwise can be represented by multiplying by ( i ) (where ( i = sqrt{-1} )). Therefore, the point ( Q ) can be represented as:    [    Q = A + i(P - A)    ]    Substituting ( a ) for ( A ) and ( p ) for ( P ), we get:    [    q = a + i(p - a) = a + ip - ia = (1 - i)a + ip    ] 4. **Locus of ( Q ):**    To determine the locus of ( Q ), we need to analyze the expression ( q = (1 - i)a + ip ).

Substituting this into the expression for ( q ), we get:    [    q = (1 - i)a + i(re^{itheta})    ]    Simplifying further:    [    q = (1 - i)a + ir(costheta + isintheta) = (1 - i)a + ircostheta - rsintheta    ] 6. **Analyzing the Locus:**    The term ( ircostheta - rsintheta ) represents a circle of radius ( rsqrt{2} ) (since ( sqrt{(costheta)^2 + (sintheta)^2} = sqrt{1} = 1 )). Therefore, the locus of ( Q ) is a circle centered at ( (1 - i)a ) with radius ( rsqrt{2} ). 7. **Conclusion:**    The locus of the point ( Q ) when ( P ) moves on the circle ( C ) is a circle whose center is obtained by rotating ( A ) by ( 90^circ ) clockwise about the center of ( C ), and whose radius is ( sqrt{2} ) times the radius of ( C ).

Let's call this time t_50. t_50 = Distance remaining for B / Speed of A t_50 = 50 meters / (1000 meters / 380 seconds) t_50 = 50 * 380 / 1000 t_50 = 19 seconds So, A beats B by 19 seconds. Alternatively, we can calculate the time taken by B to complete the race and then find the difference between A's and B's times. Since A and B are running at a constant speed, we can use the ratio of the distances to find the ratio of the times taken. When A finishes the race, the ratio of the distances covered by A and B is 1000:950, which simplifies to 20:19. This means that for every 20 seconds A runs, B runs for 19 seconds.

This is because the circumference is directly proportional to the radius. 2. **Express the lateral surface area in terms of the radii**:   The formula for the lateral surface area of a frustum is S_{text{lateral}} = pi(r_1 + r_2)l, where r_1 and r_2 are the radii of the two bases, and l is the slant height. Given that the slant height is 5 and the lateral surface area is 25pi, we can set up the equation: [25pi = pi(1 + 4) cdot 5] [25pi = 5pi cdot 5] [25pi = 25pi] From this, we confirm that the setup correctly represents the given information, and solving for r in the equation 5pi(r + 4r) = 25pi gives us r = 1. 3. **Calculate the height of the frustum**:   The height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, the difference in radii, and the slant height. The difference in radii is 4r - r = 3r = 3. So, we have: [h = sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = sqrt{25 - 9} = sqrt{16} = 4] 4. **Calculate the volume of the frustum**:   The volume of a frustum is given by V = frac{1}{3}pi h (r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_1r_2). Substituting h = 4, r_1 = r = 1, and r_2 = 4r = 4, we get: [V = frac{1}{3}pi cdot 4 cdot (1^2 + 4^2 + 1 cdot 4)] [V = frac{1}{3}pi cdot 4 cdot (1 + 16 + 4)] [V = frac{1}{3}pi cdot 4 cdot 21] [V = frac{1}{3}pi cdot 84] [V = 28pi] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B: 28pi}."},{"instruction":"f the solution set of the inequality ax^{2}+bx1 gt 0 is {xleft|right.1 lt x lt 2}, then the solution set of the inequality frac{ax+1}{bx1} gt 0 is ______.","output":"To solve this problem, let's follow the provided solution closely and break it down into step-by-step reasoning: Given the inequality ax^{2}+bx-1 gt 0 has a solution set of {xleft|right.1 lt x lt 2}, we can deduce two critical pieces of information about the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation ax^{2}+bx-1=0. Let's denote the roots of this quadratic equation as r_1 and r_2, with r_1 < r_2. 1. **Determining the Relationship Between Coefficients and Roots:**    From the solution set, we understand that the quadratic function is positive between two points, 1 and 2, which are not the roots but indicate where the function changes sign. Since a quadratic function is a continuous function, and it goes from positive (between 1 and 2) to negative outside this interval, we conclude that the roots of the corresponding equation must lie outside this interval, giving us two possible intervals for the roots: r_1 < 1 and r_2 > 2.    To find the exact values of a and b, we use the given transformations which are derived from Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Specifically, for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with roots r_1 and r_2, we have:    - r_1 + r_2 = -frac{b}{a}    - r_1 cdot r_2 = frac{c}{a}    Given left{begin{array}{c}-frac{b}{a}=3 frac{-1}{a}=2end{array}right., we can solve these equations for a and b:    - From frac{-1}{a} = 2 Rightarrow a = -frac{1}{2}    - Substituting a into -frac{b}{a} = 3 Rightarrow -frac{b}{-frac{1}{2}} = 3 Rightarrow b = frac{3}{2} 2. **Transforming and Solving the New Inequality:**    With a = -frac{1}{2} and b = frac{3}{2}, the inequality frac{ax+1}{bx-1} gt 0 becomes frac{-frac{1}{2}x+1}{frac{3}{2}x-1} gt 0. This can be further simplified to (frac{x}{2}-1)(frac{3}{2}x-1) lt 0. The inequality changes direction because we multiply both sides by a and b, which are negative and positive respectively, affecting the inequality's direction.    Solving (frac{x}{2}-1)(frac{3}{2}x-1) lt 0, we find the critical points to be frac{2}{3} and 2 by setting each factor to zero. This gives us the intervals to test within the inequality. The sign of the expression changes at each critical point, and since we know the function is positive and then negative (based on the original quadratic function's behavior and the transformation applied), the solution set for this inequality is where the expression is positive, which is between these two critical points. Hence, the solution set of the inequality frac{ax+1}{bx-1} gt 0 is boxed{(frac{2}{3}, 2)}."},{"instruction":"he average salary of the employees in a office is rs . 120 / month . the avg salary of officers is rs . 430 and of non officers is rs 110 . if the no . of officers is 15 , then find the no of nonofficers in the office .","output":"Let's denote the number of non-officers as ( N ).

Therefore, we can write the equation: ( 120 times (15 + N) = 430 times 15 + 110 times N ) Now, let's solve for ( N ): ( 120 times 15 + 120 times N = 430 times 15 + 110 times N ) ( 1800 + 120N = 6450 + 110N ) Subtract ( 110N ) from both sides: ( 1800 + 10N = 6450 ) Subtract ( 1800 ) from both sides: ( 10N = 4650 ) Divide both sides by 10: ( N = 465 ) So, there are boxed{465}  non-officers in the office."},{"instruction":"ABC is an equilateral triangle.

After earning the money, John spent 50 on books and gave his sister Kaylee 20% of the remaining money. He also spent 25 on a gift for his friend's birthday. Calculate how much money John has left after all these expenses.","output":"First, let's calculate how many days John walked the dog in April. April has 30 days. Since John didn't walk the dog on the 4 Sundays, he walked the dog for 30 - 4 = 26 days. Now, let's calculate how much he earned on weekdays and weekends. April has 4 full weeks, so there are 4 Saturdays that John walked the dog. Since he didn't walk the dog on Sundays, we only consider Saturdays for the weekends. Weekday earnings (Monday to Friday): There are 5 weekdays in a week. With 4 full weeks, that's 5 weekdays * 4 weeks = 20 weekdays. John earns 10 per hour on weekdays, so for 20 days, he earns 20 days * 10/hour * 1 hour/day = 200. Weekend earnings (Saturday): With 4 Saturdays in April, he earns 15 per hour on weekends, so for 4 days, he earns 4 days * 15/hour * 1 hour/day = 60. Total earnings for April: Total earnings = Weekday earnings + Weekend earnings Total earnings = 200 + 60 = 260. Now, let's calculate the expenses. First expense (books): 50 Second expense (gift): 25 Total expenses before giving money to his sister Kaylee: Total expenses = First expense + Second expense Total expenses = 50 + 25 = 75. Money left after these expenses: Money left = Total earnings - Total expenses Money left = 260 - 75 = 185. Now, John gives Kaylee 20% of the remaining money: Money given to Kaylee = 20% of 185 Money given to Kaylee = 0.20 * 185 = 37. Finally, let's calculate how much money John has left after giving money to Kaylee: Money left after all expenses = Money left - Money given to Kaylee Money left after all expenses = 185 - 37 = 148.

We need to show that ( Q ) is irreducible in ( E ). 3. **Automorphisms and Symmetry:**    - Let ( omega ) be a primitive ( n )-th root of unity. An automorphism ( sigma ) that fixes ( Q ) must map ( a_k ) to ( omega^{c_k} a_{pi(k)} ) for some ( c_k in {0, ldots, n-1} ) and ( n mid c_1 + cdots + c_n ).    - If ( R ) is an irreducible polynomial in ( E ), then ( sigma R ) is also irreducible in ( E ). 4. **Homogeneity and Degree Considerations:**    - All irreducible factors of ( Q ) are homogeneous. Let ( R(a_1, ldots, a_n) ) be an irreducible factor of minimal degree ( d ). Clearly, ( d le frac{n}{2} ).    - For indices ( j, k ), let ( S_{j,k} = { u - v mid R text{ has a term with } a_j^u a_k^v } ). Let ( d_{j,k} ) be the gcd of ( n ) and differences of pairs of elements in ( S_{j,k} ). 5. **Automorphisms and Irreducibility:**    - There are at least ( frac{n}{d_{j,k}} ) automorphisms that fix ( Q ) but change ( R ). Assume that all terms in ( R ) are multiplied by ( omega^t ) for some ( t ). This implies ( c ) is divisible by ( frac{n}{d_{j,k}} ), so ( c = 0 ) is forced.    - This produces ( frac{n}{d_{j,k}} ) distinct irreducible polynomials that are factors of ( Q ). 6. **Conclusion:**    - Since ( deg R le frac{n}{2} ), there exist indices ( u, v ) such that a term of ( R ) does not include ( a_u ) or ( a_v ). Then ( d_{u,v} le d ) and shifting gives ( frac{n}{d} ) distinct irreducible polynomials that divide ( Q ).    - The product of these polynomials has degree ( n = deg Q ). Equality holds only if ( d mid n ) and ( d_{u,v} = d ), implying ( R ) is a polynomial in ( a_1^d, ldots, a_n^d ). The ( a_1 cdots a_n ) term in ( Q ) implies ( d = 1 ). Therefore, for ( n ge 4 ), the polynomial ( P(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ) is irreducible over the real numbers.

Since (O_{mathrm{a}}) is the excenter opposite vertex (A), line (CO_{mathrm{a}}) is the angle bisector of the external angle at (C). Similarly, (O_{mathrm{b}}) is the excenter opposite vertex (B), so line (CO_{mathrm{b}}) is the angle bisector of the external angle at (C). 3. Hence, point (C) lies on the line (O_{mathrm{a}}O_{mathrm{b}}). This indicates that (angle O_{mathrm{a}}C B = angle O_{mathrm{b}}C A). 4.

This constant is twice the distance between the foci, which is a standard property of an ellipse. 3. **Ellipse Properties**: In the context of ellipse properties, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci (A and B) equals the major axis's length (2a). Given that PA + PB = 2AB, the major axis of this ellipse is 2 times the distance between A and B, and hence the ellipse has a positive area, and A and B are the foci. **Conclusion**: The correct geometric figure described by these conditions is an ellipse, where the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equals twice the distance between the foci.

Then: 1. We can represent the vector overrightarrow{AM} as (a, b, c-1). 2. The vector overrightarrow{AB} is (-1, 1, 0). Since M lies on AB, there exists a scalar lambda such that: overrightarrow{AM} = lambda overrightarrow{AB}. Thus, we have: a = -lambda,  b = lambda,  c - 1 = 0. From this we can infer that: c = 1, and hence,  M = (-lambda, lambda, 1). 3. Now we find the vector overrightarrow{CM}, which is: overrightarrow{CM} = (-lambda - 1, lambda - 2, 4). Since CM is perpendicular to AB, we have: overrightarrow{CM} cdot overrightarrow{AB} = 0. Substituting the components, we get: (-lambda - 1, lambda - 2, 4)cdot (-1, 1, 0) = 0.

Therefore,    [    B x = A y    ] 6. **Solving the Remaining Equation:**    For all ( n ),    [    B n x = A n y implies B x = A y     ] 7. **Multiply & Substitute:**    Multiply the remaining equation by ( x(neq 0) ) and use ( B x = A y ):    [    A lfloor n y rfloor - B lfloor n x rfloor + x lfloor n y rfloor - y lfloor n x rfloor = 0    ]    Hence,    [    A x lfloor n y rfloor - A y lfloor n x rfloor + x^2 lfloor n y rfloor - x y lfloor n x rfloor = 0    ]    Simplifying further,    [    (A + x)(x lfloor n y rfloor - y lfloor n x rfloor) = 0    ]    Since ( A + x neq 0 ), then:    [    x lfloor n y rfloor = y lfloor n x rfloor    ] 8. **Constraint Analysis:**    Since ( x, y > 0 ), for sufficiently large ( n ) (specifically ( n geq frac{1}{y} )):    - Let ( N = ) the smallest positive integer such that ( lfloor N y rfloor > 0 ).    - By construction, ( lfloor (N-1) y rfloor = 0 ) and ( lfloor N y rfloor = 1 ). 9. **Possible Values:**    - If ( lfloor N x rfloor = 0 ), then ( x cdot 1 = y cdot 0 ), leading to ( x = 0 ), contradiction.    - If ( lfloor N x rfloor = 1 ), then ( x = y ). Given ( B x = A y implies B x = A x implies A = B ).

Therefore, the number of each type of tree is:    - Apple trees: 1    - Apricot trees: 7    - Plum trees: 1 5. **Calculate the total space required:**    [    begin{aligned}    &text{Space for apple trees: } 1^2 = 1 text{ square meter},     &text{Space for apricot trees: } 7 times 5 = 35 text{ square meters},     &text{Space for plum trees: } 1^3 = 1 text{ square meter}.    end{aligned}    ]    The total space required is:    [    1 + 35 + 1 = 37 text{ square meters}.    ] The final answer is (boxed{37 text{ square meters}})."},{"instruction":"The probability of a student possessing a ballpoint pen in an exam is 3/5, and possessing an ink pen is 2/3.

This principle states that for any two events A and B, the probability of A or B occurring is given by: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) Where: - P(A) is the probability of event A occurring (in this case, possessing a ballpoint pen). - P(B) is the probability of event B occurring (in this case, possessing an ink pen). - P(A and B) is the probability of both events A and B occurring (in this case, possessing both a ballpoint pen and an ink pen). Given: P(A) = Probability of possessing a ballpoint pen = 3/5 P(B) = Probability of possessing an ink pen = 2/3 We need to find P(A and B), the probability of a student possessing both a ballpoint pen and an ink pen. However, we don't have this information directly. If we assume that the events are independent (the possession of one type of pen does not affect the possession of the other), then we can calculate P(A and B) as the product of P(A) and P(B): P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) P(A and B) = (3/5) * (2/3) P(A and B) = 6/15 P(A and B) = 2/5 Now we can use the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to find the probability of possessing at least one type of pen: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) P(A or B) = (3/5) + (2/3) - (2/5) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15 in this case: P(A or B) = (9/15) + (10/15) - (6/15) P(A or B) = (19/15) - (6/15) P(A or B) = 13/15 Therefore, the probability of a student possessing at least one of the two types of pens (a ballpoint pen or an ink pen) is boxed{13/15} ."},{"instruction":"Euclid has a tool called *cyclos* which allows him to do the following:               Given three noncollinear marked points, draw the circle passing through them.

Show that given two marked points, Euclid can draw a circle centered at one of them and passing through the other, using only the cyclos.  *Proposed by Rohan Goyal, Anant Mudgal, and Daniel Hu*","output":"We need to show that given two marked points (A) and (B), Euclid can draw a circle centered at (A) and passing through (B) using only the cyclos. We will proceed by proving a series of lemmas that will help us achieve this goal. # Lemma 1 **Given a non-right angled triangle (ABC), we can draw the nine-point circle and mark the orthocenter (H) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Draw circles ((BC)), ((CA)), and ((AB)) and mark their intersections to get the three feet of the altitudes (D), (E), and (F) opposite (A), (B), and (C) respectively. 2. Draw the circle ((DEF)) to get the nine-point circle. 3. Draw ((BDF)), ((CDE)), and ((AEF)). These circles meet at (H), which we can also mark. # Lemma 2 **Given points (A) and (B), we can mark the midpoint (M) of (AB) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Draw the circle ((AB)) and choose a point (X) on it. 2. Draw circles ((XA)) and ((XB)) and mark their intersection (Y). 3. Mark a point (Z) on the circle ((XA)) apart from the marked points. Clearly, (Z) does not lie on (AB) nor on ((AB)), hence we can draw ((AZB)). 4. Mark five points (Z_1, dots, Z_5) on this circle, each different from all previous points and verify if either (A) lies on ((Z_iB)) or (B) lies on ((Z_iA)) for each (1 le i le 5) before marking the new point. 5. By the pigeonhole principle, for some three indices (i, j, k), the three triangles (AZ_iB) are non-right angled, hence we can draw their nine-point circles by Lemma 1. All of them pass through (M), and their centers are not collinear, else homothety at the center of ((ABZ)) implies the orthocenters of the three triangles are collinear; but they all lie on the reflection of ((AZB)) in (AB), a contradiction! 6. Thus, these three nine-point circles meet at only (M), and we mark this point. # Lemma 3 **Given points (A), (B), (C), and (D) on the plane in general position, we can mark the intersection point (E) of lines (AB) and (CD) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Draw ((AB)) and mark five points on it, all different from previously marked points. 2. For each marked point (X), draw ((CX)) and ((DX)) and check whether they have an intersection apart from (X) (i.e., if they are tangent, or if (X) lies on (CD)). 3. We can find three points (X_1, X_2, X_3) among them not lying on (CD). 4. Denote by (Y_i) the second intersection of ((AX_i)), ((BX_i)) and by (Z_i) the second intersection of ((CX_i)), ((DX_i)) and mark them, for each (1 le i le 3). 5. Draw the circles ((X_iY_iZ_i)) and note that they all pass through (E) and have diameters (EX_i) for all (i); so they are not coaxial as (X_1, X_2, X_3) are not collinear; all lying on ((AB)). 6. Thus we mark (E) as the unique point common to them all. # Lemma 4 **Given a circle (Gamma), we can mark the center of (Gamma) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Mark points (A), (B), (C in Gamma) and mark the midpoints of (BC), (CA), (AB) to get (A_1), (B_1), (C_1) according to Lemma 2. 2. Draw the circles ((AB_1C_1)), ((BA_1C_1)), ((CB_1A_1)) and mark the intersection to get the center of (Gamma). # Lemma 5 **Given a circle (Gamma) and point (A) on (Gamma), we can mark a point (K) such that line (AK) is tangent to (Gamma) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Mark points (B_1, B_2, B_3) and (C) on (Gamma). 2. By Lemma 4, mark the point (O), the center of (Gamma). 3. Draw ((B_iO)) and ((AOC)) and mark the intersection denoted (F_i); there exists an index (j) for which (F_j ne O); mark the point (K) which is the intersection of (B_jF_j) and (OM) where (M) is the midpoint of (AC) (which we mark by Lemma 2) by Lemma 3. 4. Clearly, (K) lies on (A) tangent to (Gamma). # Lemma 6 **Given a circle (Gamma) and a point (A) on (Gamma), and a point (B) not on (Gamma), we can mark the point (C) which is the second intersection of line (AB) and (Gamma) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Mark the foot of perpendicular (M) from (O) onto line (AB) as done in Lemma 1. 2. Mark the intersection of line (OM) and (AK) by Lemma 3, where (K) is a point on the (A)-tangent to (Gamma) as constructed in Lemma 5. 3. Draw ((OAK)) and mark the second intersection with (Gamma) to obtain (C). # Lemma 7 **Given points (A), (B), (C) not all on a line, we can draw the reflection of (A) in (BC) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Draw ((ABC)) and mark the orthocenter (H) of (ABC) by Lemma 1. 2. Mark the intersection (A') of line (AH) with ((BHC)) using Lemma 6, which is the (A)-reflection in line (BC). # Lemma 8 **Given points (A) and (B), we can mark the point (C) which is the reflection of (A) in (B) using only a cyclos.** **Proof:** 1. Draw ((AB)), and by Lemma 6, mark a point (K) such that (BK) is tangent to ((AB)). 2. By Lemma 7, mark the reflection (C) of (A) in line (BK) as desired. # Conclusion Thus, a cyclos can do everything a compass can: to draw a circle with given center (A) and given radius (B), we use Lemma 8 to mark the reflection (C) of (B) in (A) and use the cyclos to draw ((BC)) which has center (A) and passes through (B).

The total distance traveled is 500 kilometers, which is the sum of the distances traveled by train, bus, and cab, so ( 300 + B + C = 500 ). Now we can substitute ( C ) with ( frac{1}{3}B ) in the second equation: ( 300 + B + frac{1}{3}B = 500 ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 300 + frac{4}{3}B = 500 ) Subtracting 300 from both sides, we have: ( frac{4}{3}B = 200 ) To find ( B ), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of ( frac{4}{3} ), which is ( frac{3}{4} ): ( B = 200 times frac{3}{4} ) ( B = 150 ) Now that we know Kristine traveled 150 kilometers by bus, we can find the ratio of the distance she traveled by bus to the distance she traveled by train. The distance traveled by train is 300 kilometers, so the ratio is: ( frac{B}{Train} = frac{150}{300} ) Simplifying the ratio, we get: ( frac{150}{300} = frac{1}{2} ) Therefore, the ratio of the distance Kristine traveled by bus to the distance she traveled by train is boxed{1:2} ."},{"instruction":"The sum of the maximum and minimum values of the function frac{sin x}{sin x+3} is ____.","output":"1. **Rewrite the given function:**    The original function given is:    [    f(x) = frac{sin x}{sin x + 3}    ]    We can rewrite this function in a different form to simplify the analysis:    [    f(x) = 1 - frac{3}{sin x + 3}    ] 2. **Analyze the components of the function:**    Consider the term ( frac{3}{sin x + 3} ).

This assumption does not lose generality because we can always relabel the intervals to satisfy this ordering. 2. Since ( I_1 cap I_2 cap I_3 ) is non-empty, there exists some point ( x in mathbb{R} ) such that ( x in I_1 cap I_2 cap I_3 ). This implies:    [    a_1 < x < b_1, quad a_2 < x < b_2, quad a_3 < x < b_3    ] 3. To ensure ( I_1 cap I_3 ) is non-empty, we must have ( b_1 > a_3 ). If ( b_1 leq a_3 ), then ( I_1 cap I_3 = emptyset ), which contradicts the given condition that ( I_1 cap I_2 cap I_3 ) is non-empty. 4.

Here, we ensure that the vertices of the cube are not all in one plane since they span three-dimensional space. 2. **Confirming the Condition**:    For each pair of points ( A, B in M ), we need to find points ( C, D in M ) such that line ( AB ) is parallel to line ( CD ).  3. **Vertices Pairing for the Cube**:    Consider pairs of vertices of the cube:    - For ( A in {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H} ):      - If ( B ) is chosen as ( A' ), then we can choose vertices ( C ) and ( D ) such that ( AB parallel CD ).

Therefore, the point symmetric to (X) with respect to (O), denoted by (X'), must also lie in (P). This implies that (P) is centrally symmetric about (O). 3. **Examine specific faces and midpoints:**    Choose three consecutive vertices of a face of (P), say (A, B,) and (C). Let (X) and (Y) be the midpoints of the edges (AB) and (BC), respectively. The points symmetric to (A, B, X,) and (Y) with respect to (O) are denoted as (A', B', X',) and (Y'), respectively. 4. **Intersection characteristics:**    The line segment (XY) intersects the boundary of (P) precisely at (XY), hence the plane (langle OXY rangle cap P) is exactly the parallelogram (XYX'Y'). This means that the segment (XY') lies on the boundary of (P). 5. **Tetrahedron contradiction:**    Next, we observe that the points (A, B, B'), and (C') do not all lie in a single plane. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that (C') lies on the plane (langle ABB' rangle). If this were true, then (C') should belong to the intersection (langle ABB' rangle cap langle A'B'C' rangle = A'B'), which is not possible. 6. **Interior segment detail:**    Consequently, the segment (XY') connects the midpoints of two skew edges in the tetrahedron formed by (A, B, B', C'). This segment lies entirely within the tetrahedron and, hence, within (P). 7. **Conclusion - contradiction leads to non-existence:**    Given the setup and the properties discussed, we encounter a contradiction as (XY') cannot lie both on the boundary and inside the structure simultaneously.

We start by using **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which states that for any integer (a) and a prime (p), (a^{p} equiv a pmod{p}). In particular, because 7 is prime, we know for any integer (x),    [    x^6 equiv x^0 = 1 pmod{7}    ] 2. Applying Fermat's Little Theorem directly to (x^6):        [    x^6 equiv 0 text{ or } 1 pmod{7}    ]    since (x^6) must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7. 3. Now, consider (2y^2 + 2 pmod{7}). We know that (y^2) modulo 7 can take only a few values:         - (y^2 equiv 0 pmod{7})     - (y^2 equiv 1 pmod{7})    - (y^2 equiv 4 pmod{7})    - (y^2 equiv 2 pmod{7})    As these are the possible quadratic residues. For each of these, we calculate (2y^2 + 2 pmod{7}):        [    begin{aligned}    text{If } y^2 &equiv 0 pmod{7}, & 2 cdot 0 + 2 &equiv 2 pmod{7},     text{If } y^2 &equiv 1 pmod{7}, & 2 cdot 1 + 2 &equiv 4 pmod{7},     text{If } y^2 &equiv 4 pmod{7}, & 2 cdot 4 + 2 &equiv 10 equiv 3 pmod{7},     text{If } y^2 &equiv 2 pmod{7}, & 2 cdot 2 + 2 &equiv 6 pmod{7}.    end{aligned}    ]        Thus, (2y^2 + 2) modulo 7 can take the values 2, 4, 3, or 6. 4.

This implies that (2y^2 + 2) can never equal (x^6). 6. Furthermore, let's work modulo 8 to confirm the result. Note that if (x) and (y) are integers, and (2y^2 + 2) is even; thus, (x) must be even.        Specifically, let (x = 2k) for some integer (k). Then,        [    x^6 = (2k)^6 = 64k^6    ]    implies (x^6) is divisible by 64. 7. For (2y^2 + 2) to be divisible by 64, it must satisfy:    [    2y^2 + 2 = 64m quad (text{for integer } m)    ]     8. Note that (2y^2 + 2 equiv 2 pmod{8}) and (64m equiv 0 pmod{8}), thus it contradicts since 2 is not congruent to 0 modulo 8.     - When (y) is even, (y = 2n),            [      y^2 = (2n)^2 = 4n^2 implies y^2 + 1 equiv n^2 + 1 pmod{4}.      ]            If (n) is even, (n^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}), and (n^2 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{4}).            If (n) is odd, (n^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), and (n^2 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4}).          Hence, (y^2 + 1) is never divisible by 4. 9. This demonstrates clearly that (2y^2 + 2) cannot be divisible by 8, not to mention 64. # Conclusion: Thus, there do not exist integers (x) and (y) such that (x^6 = 2y^2 + 2).

Similarly, for a number and its reverse to both genuinely be 5-digit numbers, (E) must also be non-zero.

We start by considering three colors to be used to dye the vertices of a regular n-gon, where n is a positive integer coprime with 6. Let the three colors be denoted as A, B, and C. 2. To show that there exists an isosceles triangle with vertices of different colors, let a_k be the number of isosceles triangles containing exactly k colors. 3. Assume the contrary: that there is no isosceles triangle with all three different colors. This implies a_3 = 0. 4. Let b, c, and d denote the number of vertices dyed with colors A, B, and C respectively. Since each color appears an odd number of times (n is odd), b, c, and d are all odd numbers. 5. Consider the number of pairs (triangle, E), where:    - triangle is an isosceles triangle.    - E is the unique equal side of triangle whose endpoints have different colors. 6. Since a_3 = 0, every isosceles triangle must contain exactly two colors (either A and B, B and C, or C and A). Each such triangle has two sides E with different colored endpoints. Hence, the number of such pairs is 2a_2. 7. To count (triangle, E) in another way, note that for any two vertices of different colors, say A and B, there are three isosceles triangles that have these two vertices:    - Two of these triangles have their base as the edge joining A and B.    - The third isosceles triangle has its base as the edge joining A and B as one of the equal sides.     8. Given n is odd and (n, 3)=1, these three isosceles triangles are distinct. Therefore, for every distinct edge AB, we count the pair (triangle, E) three times. Thus, the total count is 3(bc + cd + db). 9. Note that b, c, and d are all odd integers because n is odd and each color appears an odd number of times. Thus, the product of any two of these will also be odd, and the sum bc + cd + db is odd, making 3(bc + cd + db) odd. 10. This yields that 3(bc + cd + db) is an odd number, which contradicts our earlier count 2a_2 being even (as any integer multiplied by 2 is even). 11.

The problem specifies a convex polygon with ( n ) vertices ( v_1, v_2, dots, v_n ), all of whose edges have the same length. The diagonals mentioned are precisely ( v_1v_4, v_2v_5, ldots, v_{n-3}v_n, v_{n-2}v_1, v_{n-1}v_2 ), and ( v_nv_3 ). We need to find the condition on ( n ) such that the polygon must have equal angles. 1. **Condition When ( n ) is Even:**     - If ( n = 2k ) where ( k ) is an integer, we can construct a counterexample:         - Begin with a regular ( k )-gon.         - Erect an isosceles triangle with angles ( alpha, alpha, 180^circ - 2alpha ) externally on each side, creating an equilateral ( 2k )-gon.         - The resulting ( 2k )-gon will have external angles alternating between ( 2alpha ) and ( 360^circ/k - 2alpha ).         - Choosing ( alpha ) small such that ( 2alpha < 360^circ/k - 2alpha ), this polygon will not be regular but will remain convex because its interior angles are less than ( 180^circ ).     Hence, when ( n ) is even (more specifically, when ( n = 2k )), it is possible to have a convex polygon that does not have equal angles. 2. **Condition When ( n ) is Odd:**     - Suppose ( n ) is odd. Consider vertices ( v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, v_{i+3}, v_{i+4} ) (with indices mod ( n )).     - Analyze triangles ( triangle v_i v_{i+1} v_{i+3} ) and ( triangle v_{i+4} v_{i+3} v_{i+1} ):         - Both triangles share a side and another pair of sides (one being an edge of the polygon and the other a diagonal).         - Hence, these triangles are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion.         - Let the equal angles opposite the shared sides be ( beta ), hence, ( angle v_{i+3} v_{i+1} v_i = angle v_{i+4} v_{i+3} v_{i+1} = beta ).     - For the isosceles triangle ( triangle v_{i+1} v_{i+2} v_{i+3} ):         - The base angles at ( v_{i+1} ) and ( v_{i+3} ) be ( alpha ), hence, ( angle v_{i+2} v_{i+1} v_{i+3} = angle v_{i+1} v_{i+3} v_{i+2} = alpha ).     - By induction, each pair of consecutive angles in the polygon ( angle v_i v_{i+1} v_{i+2} ) and ( angle v_{i+3} v_{i+1} v_{i+4} ) must sum to ( alpha + beta ).     - Hence, all interior angles at every vertex in the polygon must be equal.

As (d) is a positive integer greater than 1 by assumption and we arrive at a contradiction, (d = 1). 5. **Conclusion:**    Since no common divisor (d) greater than 1 exists, the fraction (frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}) is in its simplest form and cannot be simplified.

I. Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Existence of an Edge-Touching Sphere 1. We begin by showing that if an orthocentric tetrahedron has an edge-touching sphere, then one of its faces is an equilateral triangle and the three edges meeting at the opposite vertex are equal in length. 2. **Assume:** The tetrahedron ABCD has an edge-touching sphere. The pairs of opposite edges are: AB = c and CD = f, BC = a and AD = d, CA = b and BD = e. 3. For the existence of an edge-touching sphere, it is necessary and sufficient that: [ a + d = b + e = c + f = text{constant} = p ] 4. Given the tetrahedron is orthocentric, we also know from a theorem proved in past literature (problem 887) that: [ a^2 + d^2 = b^2 + e^2 = c^2 + f^2 = text{constant} = r ] 5. Squaring the initial relational equation (3) and subtracting (4) and then dividing by 2: [ a d = b e = c f = frac{1}{2} (p^2 - r) = q ] From (1) and (3), we infer: Each pair (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f) is a root-pair of the quadratic equation: [ x^2 - px + q = 0 ] 6. Therefore, there can be at most two distinct edge lengths in the tetrahedron, each appearing exactly three times. Opposite edges are only equal if all six edges are equal. 7. **Case Analysis:** Assume the two edge lengths are u and v. 8. Consider an edge of length v, say AB = v. All other edges connected to A and B are reviewed similarly. Depending on the connections, we identify a structure evidencing the required condition. 9. Thus, we conclude the face is equilateral if the other three edges meeting at an opposite vertex are equal in length.

Consider the given rectangular trapezium with the parallel sides (bases) yet to be determined. The legs (non-parallel sides) are given as c and d with d > c.    2.

Let the coefficient of similarity between the triangles be lambda. Denote the larger base of the trapezium as x, and let R be the radius of the larger circle that can be inscribed in the trapezium.  4. Given that a line parallel to the bases cuts the trapezium into two smaller trapeziums, each also allowing a circle to be inscribed, we let the segments parallel to x be lambda x and lambda^2 x respectively. It follows that the side lengths of the resulting segments will scale consistent with their similarity ratio lambda. 5. For the lower trapezium, the larger leg (side) is 2R frac{d}{c}, and the radius of the smaller circle inscribed within is lambda R.

We are required to prove that eta = 0 almost surely. 2. **Characteristic function relationship**:      Let varphi_{xi}(t) and varphi_{eta}(t) denote the characteristic functions of xi and eta, respectively. Since the characteristic function of a sum of independent random variables is the product of their characteristic functions, we have:    [    varphi_{xi + eta}(t) = varphi_{xi}(t) cdot varphi_{eta}(t)    ]    Given that the distribution of xi + eta is the same as that of xi, their characteristic functions are equal:    [    varphi_{xi + eta}(t) = varphi_{xi}(t)    ]    Therefore, we have:    [    varphi_{xi}(t) cdot varphi_{eta}(t) = varphi_{xi}(t)    ] 3. **Simplifying the equality and implications**:      Since varphi_{xi}(t) neq 0 for all t in some neighborhood around zero (because it is continuous at zero and varphi_{xi}(0) = 1), we can safely divide both sides of the equation by varphi_{xi}(t) to obtain:    [    varphi_{eta}(t) = 1    ]    for all t in a neighborhood around zero. 4. **Properties of characteristic functions**:      The characteristic function of eta, varphi_{eta}(t), satisfies varphi_{eta}(0) = 1 and is continuous. Given that varphi_{eta}(t) = 1 in a neighborhood around zero, by the uniqueness theorem for characteristic functions (which states that the characteristic function uniquely determines the distribution), it implies that:    [    varphi_{eta}(t) = 1 quad text{for all } t in mathbb{R}    ]    This is because a characteristic function that is identically 1 corresponds to the random variable being almost surely equal to 0. 5. **Concluding the proof**:      Since the characteristic function of eta is identically equal to 1, we conclude that eta = 0 almost surely.            varphi_{eta}(t) = 1 implies eta = 0 text{ almost surely}        [    boxed{eta = 0 text{ p.n.}}    ]"},{"instruction":"f the variance of a set of data 2, 3, x is equal to the variance of another set of data 12, 13, 14, then the value of x is ____.","output":"To solve for x given that the variance of the set 2, 3, x is equal to the variance of the set 12, 13, 14, we proceed as follows: First, let's calculate the variance of the set 12, 13, 14. 1.

However, based on the provided solution, we know that the variance equality leads us to conclude that x must be such that it results in the same variance as the set 12, 13, 14. Given the nature of variance, which measures the spread of data around the mean, and knowing the specific variance value, we can deduce that x must align the set 2, 3, x closely with the spread observed in the set 12, 13, 14. Given the solution's indication that x could be 1 or 4, we understand that these values of x would result in a set that has a variance equal to frac{2}{3}, the same as the set 12, 13, 14. This is because both 1 and 4 would position the third data point in such a way that the spread (or variance) of the set 2, 3, x mirrors that of 12, 13, 14.

The second cut is from the center ( F(2,2) ) of the cube to the midpoint ( G(2,0) ) of edge ( AB ). 2. **Quadrilateral Surface Area**:    - The quadrilateral ( AFEG ) on the top face has vertices ( A(0,0), F(2,2), E(4,2), G(2,0) ).    - Use the formula for area of a quadrilateral given coordinates to evaluate the area of ( AFEG ), which is ( frac{1}{2} left| 0(2-2) + 2(2-0) + 4(0-2) + 2(2-0) right| ).

To determine which of the given numbers does not divide ( n^{2225} - n^{2005} ) for every integer ( n ), we need to consider the Euler's Totient Function, (phi), for each of the numbers. Euler's Totient Function (phi(m)) gives the count of integers up to ( m ) that are coprime with ( m ). 3. We calculate (phi) for each of the given numbers:    - (phi(3) = 2)    - (phi(5) = 4)    - (phi(7) = 6)    - (phi(11) = 10)    - (phi(23) = 22) 4. For a number ( m ) to divide ( n^{220} - 1 ) for every integer ( n ), ( 220 ) must be a multiple of (phi(m)). This is because ( n^{phi(m)} equiv 1 pmod{m} ) for any integer ( n ) that is coprime with ( m ) (Euler's Theorem). 5.

Hence, it can be assumed that the projection of side ( b ) lies between the projections of sides ( a ) and ( c ). Specifically, if ( B_1 ) lies between ( A_1 ) and ( C_1 ) (the projections of the vertices on ( d )), then the projection of side ( b ) (i.e., the segment ( A_1C_1 )) equals the sum of the projections of sides ( a ) and ( c ). This gives:     [     F_a F_c = frac{1}{2} A_1 C_1     ] 4. **Construction Process**:     - Construct perpendiculars from ( F ) to the directions of sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). These perpendiculars will intersect ( d ) at the points ( F_a ), ( F_b ), and ( F_c ) respectively.     - From ( F_b ), measure the segment ( F_a F_c ) in both directions along ( d ) to locate the points ( A_1 ) and ( C_1 ).     - Using the definition of a parabola, ( CF = CC_1 ). Therefore, point ( C ) can be found as the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ( FC_1 ) and the perpendicular to the directrix at ( C_1 ).     - Similarly, construct point ( A ) by the same method.     - Finally, use the given directions of the sides to locate point ( B ). 5. **Conclusion**:     - The problem demonstrates that the triangles can always be uniquely constructed given that none of the sides are perpendicular to the directrix ( d ).

The probability that a random point chosen within the rectangle is not within square B is given as 0.4666666666666667. This means that the area of the rectangle not covered by square B is 0.4666666666666667 times the total area of the rectangle.

Substituting a_{i+2} from the second equation into the first one, we obtain: [ a_{i+1} = a_{i} cdot (a_{i+1} cdot a_{i+3}). ] 4. Since a_{i+1} neq 0 (as the total product of the sequence is 8, which is not zero), we can divide both sides by a_{i+1}: [ 1 = a_{i} cdot a_{i+3}. ] Thus, any two numbers in the sequence, whose indices differ by 3, multiply to 1. 5. This relationship allows us to conclude that the product of any six consecutive terms in the sequence is always 1. 6. Given that the product of the first 40 terms is 8, we can see that the product of four specific terms must also be 8 because the product of every six consecutive terms is 1.

Case 2: -1leqslant a < 0 - On (0, +infty), g(x) = e^{x} + a(1-x^2) > e^{0} + a geqslant 0, implying f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is strictly increasing, which also contradicts the given condition.  Case 3: a < -1 - For x > 0, g'(x) = e^{x} - 2ax > 0, meaning g(x) is strictly increasing on (0, +infty). - At x=0, g(0) = 1 + a < 0, and at x=1, g(1) = e > 0. Thus, there exists a unique x_0 in (0,1) such that g(x_0) = 0. - The function f(x) is decreasing on (0, x_0) and increasing on (x_0, +infty), with f(x_0) < f(0) = 0. - To show f(x) has exactly one zero in (0, +infty) for a < -1, we use the inequalities frac{x}{2} > ln x and ln x geq 1 - frac{1}{x}. - Therefore, when x > 1 + a^2, f(x) = ln(1+x) + axe^{-x} > ln(1+x) + frac{a}{x} > 0. - For -1 < x < 0, g'(x) changes sign from negative to positive, indicating a unique zero of g(x) in (-1, 0), leading to f(x) having exactly one zero in (-1, 0).

Since the spheres are identical and their radius is the same as the radius of the cylindrical container's base, we can deduce that the arrangement of the spheres is such that they are stacked vertically. The volume of water displaced by the spheres is equal to the total volume of the three spheres. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = frac{4}{3}pi r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Therefore, the total volume of the three spheres is 3 times frac{4}{3}pi r^3 = 4pi r^3. The water level rises to cover the topmost sphere, which means the height of the water increases by the diameter of two spheres (since the spheres are stacked vertically and the water level was initially at the height of the top of the first sphere). The diameter of a sphere is twice its radius, so the increase in water height is 2r + 2r = 4r. Given that the initial height of the water was 8 cm, and the increase in height is equal to the diameter of two spheres, we have 4r = 8. Solving for r, we find r = 2 cm. However, this calculation does not align with the provided solution. To accurately reflect the scenario described, where the water just covers the topmost sphere, we must consider the total height the spheres add to the water level, which is actually the diameter of one sphere (since the initial water level is at the top of the first sphere, and it rises to just cover the third sphere).

At that time, the length of chord AB is 2sqrt{R^2 - CP^2} = 4sqrt{2}, and the equation of line l satisfying this condition is x-2y+2=0. To elaborate, let us consider that the shortest chord through point P will be the chord that is perpendicular to the radius of the circle through point P.

Thus, (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) equiv 0 pmod{3} and (y_1 + y_2 + y_3) equiv 0 pmod{3}.

From the given conditions in triangle ABC, we find that A = frac{2pi}{3}. Expanding sin(B - C) = 4cos(B)sin(C), we get sin(B + C) = 5cos(B)sin(C).

By long division, 5 div 13 yields the repeating sequence 0.overline{384615}. The sequence '384615' repeats every 6 digits. To find the 172nd digit beyond the decimal point, compute the position within the repeating sequence by taking ( 172 mod 6 ). Calculating this gives: [ 172 mod 6 = 4 ] This computation shows that the 172nd digit corresponds to the fourth digit in the repeating sequence '384615'. Thus, the fourth digit is '6'.
