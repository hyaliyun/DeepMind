The first 15 cases of Zika virus in the USA have been confirmed in Florida, mostly in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The virus is known to cause fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis in adults, but the most serious health risk is to pregnant women. Zika has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly, which results in newborns having abnormally small heads. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel warning for all pregnant women to avoid traveling to areas where Zika virus is present in large numbers, including parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. The CDC also recommends that pregnant women and couples trying to conceive who have traveled to those areas recently should seek testing and medical care immediately. As the virus spreads from person to person through mosquitoes, preventing infection is crucial to stopping further spread of the virus. The Florida Health Department has reported that they are actively working to eliminate any mosquito breeding grounds, and they have increased mosquito surveillance and control efforts in the affected areas. The agency has also issued a mosquito-borne illness advisory for all residents and visitors to the state, encouraging them to take proper precautions to avoid mosquito bites. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern, and numerous health organizations including the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) are urging Congress to provide funding for research, prevention and treatment of this virus. While the Zika virus is not yet fully understood, the CDC and other organizations are urging people to take all necessary precautions against mosquito bites, especially in areas where cases of the virus have been confirmed.

Organic vs. Non-Organic Fruits and Vegetables: Which is More Nutritious? The debate over whether organic fruits and vegetables are more nutritious than their non-organic counterparts has been ongoing for quite some time. Some studies have suggested that organic produce contains higher levels of certain nutrients, while others have found no significant differences. Let's take a closer look at what the research says. Nutrient Content One study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that organic produce had higher levels of vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus compared to non-organic produce. Another study by the American Society for Horticultural Science found that organic strawberries had higher levels of antioxidants than conventionally grown strawberries. On the other hand, a review of 343 studies published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that while organic produce had a lower risk of pesticide contamination, it did not have significantly higher levels of nutrients compared to non-organic produce. So, while there is some evidence to suggest that organic produce may contain more nutrients than conventionally grown produce, the jury is still out. Pesticide Contamination One area where organic produce consistently outperforms non-organic produce is in terms of pesticide contamination. A study published in the Journal of Environmental Research found that children who ate non-organic produce had significantly higher levels of pesticide residues in their urine compared to children who ate organic produce. Another study by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) found that some conventionally grown fruits and vegetables (such as apples, strawberries, and spinach) had high levels of pesticide residues, while their organic counterparts had little to none. Conclusion While the evidence is mixed, there are some indications that organic produce may contain more nutrients than conventionally grown produce. However, the most significant advantage of organic produce is its lower risk of pesticide contamination. Regardless of whether you choose to eat organic or non-organic fruits and vegetables, it's important to eat a variety of produce to ensure you get all the nutrients you need."},{"instruction":"Write a review for a hotel with mixed sentiment.","output":"The hotel is decent, with comfortable rooms and convenient amenities.

The singer was awarded 1, which she had requested in her suit, but her goal was to stand up for other women who have been sexually assaulted. The radio DJ, David Mueller, originally sued Swift for 3 million, claiming that her accusation got him fired from his job. However, Swift countersued for assault and battery, and a jury found in her favor. In her testimony during the trial, Swift said that Mueller \\"grabbed my ass underneath my skirt\\" and that it was a \\"definite grab, a very long grab.\\" She also said that she wasn't going to allow Mueller and his team to make her feel like it was her fault. Swift, who is known for her catchy pop songs and feminist anthems, has been open about using her platform to speak up for women's rights. In a statement after the verdict was announced, Swift thanked the judge and the jury for \\"giving us all a voice in this critical moment.\\" She added, \\"My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.\\" The verdict in Swift's case comes at a time when sexual assault allegations have been making headlines across the entertainment industry, from Harvey Weinstein to Kevin Spacey. Swift's decision to stand up and speak out against her assailant sends a powerful message to other survivors that they are not alone and that their voices matter.

A hurricane is a large, destructive storm that typically forms over warm ocean waters. It is a symmetrical storm, meaning its circular shape is evenly distributed with a well-defined eye at its center. Hurricanes can be hundreds of miles wide and can last for several days. They can cause storm surge, intense rainfall, and high winds that can result in flooding and widespread damage. On the other hand, a tornado is a violent, rotating column of air that forms in thunderstorm clouds and touches the ground. It is a narrow, cone-shaped storm that typically lasts for a few minutes to an hour. Tornadoes are much smaller than hurricanes and can range in size from just a few feet to over a mile wide. They are more unpredictable and can change directions quickly, making them even more dangerous. The strength of a hurricane is typically measured by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranges from Category 1 (74-95 mph winds) to Category 5 (winds exceeding 157 mph). Similarly, tornado strength is measured by the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which ranges from EF0 (65-85 mph winds) to EF5 (winds exceeding 200 mph). Overall, while both hurricanes and tornadoes are powerful and destructive, they differ in size, shape, and duration. It is important to stay informed and take appropriate safety measures in the event of either of these natural disasters."},{"instruction":"The critic consensus is: This romantic comedy is a fun and lighthearted take on a classic formula.

However, there are some objective statistics that can be used to evaluate offensive performance. One of the most common statistics used to assess offensive performance is points scored. Generally, the player or team that has scored the most points in a game is considered to have had the best offensive performance. However, this does not take into account other factors such as the efficiency of their scoring or the quality of the opposing defense. Another key statistic that is often used to evaluate offensive performance is yards gained. This can be a more accurate indicator of an offensive player's success as it takes into account their ability to move the ball up the field. A player who gains a large number of yards in a game is likely to have had a significant impact on their team's offensive performance. Other factors that can be considered when assessing offensive performance include the number of touchdowns scored, the number of completions or receptions made, the yards per carry or catch, and the player's impact on the game's outcome. Ultimately, the answer to the question of who had the best offensive performance of a game will depend on a variety of factors, including personal opinion, statistical analysis, and the context of the game. However, by considering relevant statistics and taking into account the player's impact on the team's overall performance, it is possible to make an informed judgment."},{"instruction":"Write a factual questio","output":"What is the capital of Japan?"},{"instruction":"Tweet: Just finished a great workout at the gym!

Recycling allows us to reuse materials that would typically be thrown away, helping to reduce waste, preserve natural resources, and reduce pollution. One of the primary benefits of recycling is that it helps to conserve natural resources. When we recycle items like paper and plastic, we reduce the need to extract new raw materials from the earth, such as trees and oil. By conserving these resources, we help to protect our environment and wildlife habitats, ensuring that future generations have access to the same resources we have today. Recycling also helps to reduce pollution. When materials are dumped in landfills or incinerated, they can emit harmful chemicals and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and air pollution. By recycling, we reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and reduce our carbon footprint. In addition to environmental benefits, recycling also has economic benefits. Recycling creates jobs in the collection, sorting, and processing of materials. Additionally, recycling can help to reduce the cost of producing new products since recycled materials are often cheaper than raw materials.

Pollination can occur through various mechanisms, including wind, water, and animals. Animals that aid in pollination include bees, butterflies, moths, hummingbirds, and bats. These organisms have different adaptations for pollination, such as long tongues or specialized mouthparts, that allow them to reach the nectar in flowers. As they drink nectar, they brush against pollen grains, which become attached to their bodies. These pollen grains are then transferred to the next flower they visit, allowing pollination to occur. Other organisms, such as wind-pollinated plants, rely on the movement of air currents to transport their pollen. Water-pollinated plants produce large amounts of pollen, which is released into the water and carried to other plants. Overall, pollination is a crucial process for the reproduction of many plant species, and the various organisms that aid in pollination play an important role in maintaining the biodiversity of our ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Remove all punctuation from the following sentence: Who let the dogs out, woof woof.","output":"Who let the dogs out woof woof."},{"instruction":"the sentiment of the following phrase positive or negative? a disappointing end to an otherwise great event OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"Negative."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following text: SpaceX successfully launched its latest reusable rocket, landing it safely back on Earth.","output":"SpaceX launched and landed its newest reusable rocket successfully."},{"instruction":"Are these two sentences saying the same thing?

The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of the reaction. The hydrogen ions are then transported across a membrane and used to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a high-energy molecule that serves as a source of energy for cellular processes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air is then combined with the hydrogen ions to form glucose (C6H12O6) and other organic compounds.

MacKenzie Bezos will receive a divorce settlement of 35 billion, making this one of the largest divorce settlements in history. While the split is a personal matter for the couple, many are wondering what impact it will have on Amazon's future. Some experts speculate that Jeff Bezos may have to sell off some of his Amazon shares in order to pay the settlement to his ex-wife. This could potentially impact Amazon's stock prices in the short term, but given the company's strong financial position, it is unlikely to have any long-term effects on the business. Others argue that the divorce could lead to a shift in Amazon's leadership and strategic direction. Jeff Bezos has been the driving force behind Amazon's success, and without his leadership, the company's future may be uncertain. However, Amazon has a strong executive team in place and has already begun to diversify its business beyond e-commerce, with investments in areas like artificial intelligence and healthcare. Ultimately, while the divorce between Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos is significant news, it is unlikely to have a major impact on Amazon's future.

The study, which was published in the journal Nature, analysed the environmental impact of different types of food production, and found that meat production had a much higher carbon footprint than plantbased diets. The researchers suggest that reducing meat consumption could be an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the planet. What are the benefits and challenges of switching to a more plantbased diet?","output":"\\"New Study Finds Vegetarian and Vegan Diets Better for the Environment than Meat\\" A recent study published in the journal Nature has found that consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may be a more environmentally-friendly option compared to eating meat. The research focused on analyzing the impact of different kinds of food production, with meat having the highest carbon footprint compared to plant-based diets. The study has significant implications on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment. Switching to a more plant-based diet offers numerous benefits, including a reduced carbon footprint, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and better land use. Additionally, plant-based diets are typically associated with better health outcomes, as they are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, a plant-based diet can be affordable and accessible for many people, promoting better nutritional diversity. However, there are also challenges associated with transitioning to a plant-based diet, particularly for individuals accustomed to consuming meat. Animal-based foods offer convenience, familiarity, and cultural significance in many parts of the world. Many people may also need education or resources to ensure that they meet their daily nutritional requirements with plant-based foods. It is important to note that the decision to transition to a plant-based diet is a personal choice, and individuals should do it gradually and in a way that fits their lifestyle and dietary preferences. In conclusion, reducing meat consumption and opting for a plant-based diet could be a critical step in protecting the planet, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting personal health. While there are challenges associated with the transition, the benefits of reducing meat consumption far outweigh them. With time, education, and access to affordable plant-based options, more people can enjoy the benefits of wholesome, plant-based diets."},{"instruction":"Write an instruction that relates to cooking","output":"Preheat the oven to 350°F."},{"instruction":"Camping in national parks requires a permit.

While some parents and politicians are in opposition to these guidelines, educational organizations and health experts are applauding it as a necessary measure to keep schools safe in the continuing pandemic. The guidelines have been issued in light of the highly transmissible Delta variant that is leading to a rise in COVID-19 cases across the country, especially among those who are unvaccinated. The CDC recommends that students and staff wear masks indoors to prevent the spread of the virus, especially given the number of students who are not yet in the age bracket for vaccination. However, some parents and politicians see the recommended guidelines as an infringement on their personal freedom. Those who are protesting argue that mask-wearing should be a choice, and that it is unfair to force students and staff to wear masks when they have taken the personal decision to not get vaccinated. On the other hand, health experts and educational organizations have been urging schools to follow the CDC guidelines, given the seriousness of the Delta variant. They contend that masks are an important layer of protection to keep students safe, especially in crowded classrooms and indoor spaces where the virus can easily spread. It is worth noting that several states have already implemented mask mandates in schools, regardless of vaccination status. As the new school year approaches, it remains to be seen how the CDC guidelines will be received across the country. In conclusion, the new CDC guidelines for mask-wearing in schools come at a crucial time when the Delta variant is leading to a spike in COVID-19 cases. While there are some who are opposed to the guidelines, health experts and educational organizations agree that they are a necessary measure to keep schools safe and prevent the spread of the virus.

These users have reported having their accounts suspended and/or their content removed, leading to accusations of bias and stifling of free speech. The social media giant has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that their policies are applied equally to all users. However, this has not quelled the controversy, which has rippled through the online community and fueled a larger debate about free speech online. Many believe that social media platforms have a duty to uphold the principles of free speech, allowing users to express their opinions and views without fear of censorship or retaliation. However, others argue that these platforms are private entities and have the right to enforce their own rules and regulations. Despite the ongoing debate, one thing is certain: the issue of free speech online is a complex and highly debated topic, with no easy answers or solutions. As the internet continues to evolve and transform, the question of how to balance free speech with responsible moderation will remain at the forefront of public discussions. In conclusion, the accusations of censorship on the popular social media platform have sparked a heated debate about free speech online. While the company denies any wrongdoing, the controversy has raised important questions about the role of social media in moderating public discourse and protecting users’ freedom of expression."},{"instruction":"Write a review of a foreign movie you've recently seen.","output":"I am a language model AI and I am incapable of watching or having an experience of a movie or any other physical activities."},{"instruction":"Does the word bank mean the same thing in I need to deposit this check at the bank. and The river bank was covered in mud after the storm.?","output":"No."},{"instruction":"f the premise is I always go to bed before midnight, can we deduce the hypothesis I'm currently asleep.?

Unfortunately, it falls flat on every level. Firstly, the CGI is downright cringe-worthy. The realistic fur textures and facial expressions of the actors are lost within a sea of distracting feline features. Even worse, the storytelling is disjointed and confusing. The movie fails to provide any context or character development, leading the audience to feel like they're watching an endless succession of weird singing and dancing cats. But the biggest disappointment is the lack of chemistry between cast members. With a talented ensemble including Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, and Taylor Swift, it's unfathomable how director Tom Hooper failed to capture any palpable chemistry between them. Overall, Cats is a catastrophe of a movie. Poor CGI, weak storytelling, and a lack of on-screen chemistry make this film an utter waste of time."},{"instruction":"Max was swimming in the pool.

The fossils were found in the Eastern Cape Province and belong to a smallbodied herbivore that grew to about 10 feet in length. The discovery sheds new light on the evolution of early dinosaurs in the southern hemisphere. Expand this summary.","output":"Scientists have recently uncovered a new dinosaur species in South Africa, known as Ngwevu intloko, which translates to \\"gray skull\\" in the Xhosa language. These fossils were discovered in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and are estimated to be around 200 million years old, dating back to the Early Jurassic period. These fossils belong to a small-bodied herbivorous dinosaur, growing to about 10 feet in length. The discovery of Ngwevu intloko provides new insights into the evolution of early dinosaurs in the southern hemisphere. Prior to this discovery, research on early dinosaur evolution in the southern hemisphere was sparse, but with the discovery of Ngwevu intloko, paleontologists are able to fill in the gaps of the prehistoric ecosystem. Ngwevu intloko's discovery also marks the first dinosaur fossil location within the Eastern Cape Province. This find adds to the existing knowledge of dinosaur fossils in South Africa, as the country is already known for having robust dinosaur fossil locations. Interestingly, Ngwevu intloko's discovery was sparked by the curiosity of a local farmer who discovered the fossils first. He contacted James Kitching, a South African paleontologist, who then alerted the research team in charge of the discovery. The team was able to excavate the fossils and identify them as a new dinosaur species. The discovery of Ngwevu intloko further proves that there is still so much to learn about the prehistoric world.

They are cheap, easily accessible, and convenient. However, the environmental impact of plastic straws is immense. Each year, it is estimated that Americans alone use over 500 million straws per day, and the vast majority of these end up in landfills or, even worse, in our oceans, where they can cause significant harm to marine life. The solution to this problem is simple: we need to drastically reduce our use of plastic straws. Restaurants can and should play a key role in this effort. By choosing to only offer straws upon request, or by switching to biodegradable alternatives, restaurants can help to minimize the amount of plastic waste that is generated each day. There are many potential benefits to this kind of change. For one thing, it will help to reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources like oil, which is used to make most plastic products. Additionally, it will help to protect wildlife and their habitats, which are increasingly threatened by plastic pollution. Against: The use of plastic straws in restaurants is a non-issue. While it is true that plastic straws can contribute to waste and pollution, they are hardly the biggest problem facing our planet today. There are far bigger issues that we need to focus on, such as climate change, deforestation, and rampant consumerism. Moreover, plastic straws are a minor convenience that brighten up our daily lives. They allow us to enjoy our drinks more easily and without spillage. They are also a normal aspect of dining out, and most people are not bothered by them. In short, there is no compelling reason to change our current use of plastic straws in restaurants. It is a minor issue that does not warrant any significant action. Instead, we should be focusing our efforts on more pressing environmental concerns."},{"instruction":"Does the dog refer to the same thing as it in this sentence?

In the early years of the tower's existence, it was used primarily as an observation tower. Visitors could take an elevator to the top of the tower, where they could enjoy stunning views of Paris. The tower quickly became a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Paris. Today, the Eiffel Tower remains one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. It is a symbol of Paris and an engineering marvel that attracts millions of visitors each year.

The main reasons cited for this are increased violence, limited access to healthcare and education. Unfortunately, Afghanistan ranks among the lowest globally for gender equality. Sadly, the ongoing violence against women in Afghanistan seems to be escalating, but the Taliban denies responsibility. Many women in Afghanistan are struggling to access basic healthcare and education. The situation is particularly difficult for those living in rural areas. Afghanistan has some of the lowest literacy rates in the world, with only one in three women able to read and write. This is due in part to entrenched cultural attitudes that limit women's role in society. The lack of access to healthcare is also a major concern. Many women in Afghanistan face a shortage of doctors, medicine, and hospital beds. This is particularly true for women who live outside urban areas. The situation is alarming, and urgent action is needed to protect the rights and well-being of women in Afghanistan. The international community needs to work together to ensure that women are given access to education and healthcare. It is also essential that the root causes of violence against women in Afghanistan are addressed. In conclusion, the shocking statistics demonstrate that the situation for female Afghans is dire, and the international community must take immediate action. Countries cannot turn a blind eye to the plight of women in Afghanistan. It is time to stand together to demand that the rights of women are respected, and to do everything in our power to ensure that they have access to the education and healthcare that they so desperately need.

Sie unterscheiden sich in wichtigen Aspekten, so z. B. hinsichtlich ihres Verschleierungscharakters. Gerade die Möglichkeit der Perspektivwahl verdunkelt das ganze Verhältnis: Was spezifischen Kapitalbewegungen folgt, erscheint als freie politische Entscheidung. Formal hingegen tritt die Autonomie unverhüllt hervor: Sie ist klar erkennbar und gibt sich freudig zu erkennen, denn gerade in der offenen Art ihrer Durchsetzbarkeit steckt ihre Fähigkeit, den realen Prozeß zu verdecken. (Selbst die mächtigsten Monopole sind nicht in der Lage, von sich aus Gesetze zu verkünden.) In der Wirklichkeit pendelt die Politik ständig zwischen beiden Polen hin und her: auch formale Macht ist reale Macht. Hinzu kommt noch die „Berechtigung des Zufalls” (Marx, Grundrisse S. 30), der jederzeit zu unvorhergesehenen Machtkonstellationen führt und den Spielraum der Autonomie erweitert. Im konkreten Fall kann die formale Macht selbst zur materialen werden, wenn die zu regelnden Inhalte aus der Mehrwertproduktion herausfallen und unmittelbar nur das private Leben der „Staatsbürger” betreffen. Verliert die Ökonomie ihr unmittelbares Interesse an der Politik, so wird diese aus der materialen Abhängigkeit entlassen. Nicht hinter jeder Maßnahme des Staats steckt ein Verwertungsinteresse; noch äußert sich in jedem Gesetz der politisch umgesetzte Wille irgendeiner Kapitalfraktion. Auf der zwar nicht ökonomiefreien, aber von der material unmittelbaren Herrschaft des Kapitals frei gelassenen Ebene tummeln sich selbständig Politiker, Parteien, Sittlichkeitsvereine, der Sportbund und die Dichter. Gerade für die Rolle eines Gesamtorganisators aber ist diese partielle Autonomie bedeutsam, zumindest ideologisch nützlich. Die Lückenlosigkeit einer nur vom Verwertungsinteresse bedingten Bestimmung der Politik erscheint stellenweise aufgebrochen. Die propagierte Orientierung des Staats am Allgemeinwohl erhält eher Überzeugungskraft, wenn solche Bereiche einer inhaltlich werdenden formalen Eigenständigkeit erstens breit genug sind; zweitens und vor allem öffentlich verbreitet werden. Daher auch das unverhältnismäßige Gewicht, das sie bei den Massenmedien bekommen. Man denke an die Diskussion über die Freigabe der Pornographie - eine vermutlich völlig frei von ökonomischen Pressionen zustandegekommene Entscheidung, die wirkungsvoll die Freiheit eines politischen Systems dokumentiert, dessen organisatorische Macht vielmehr im Dienst der Erhöhung der Arbeitsintensität steht und der Bestätigung des Ausbeutungsverhältnisses. (Oder auch: die Pornographie wird freigegeben; den Linksradikalen das Berufsrecht weggenommen, sofern - und hier bricht wieder die Verwertungsorientierung durch - die Ausübung eines Berufs mit emanzipatorischem Gebrauch des Organisationsapparats verbunden werden kann.) Das Wichtigste an der formalen Autonomie freilich, die zugleich sich als Macht der Form darstellt und als solche sich legitimiert (der klassenenthobene, an partikulare Inhalte nicht gebundene Staat), liegt darin, daß sie in der Ausübung des staatlichen Hauptgeschäfts sich in einer allgemeinen Organisationsbefugnis konkretisiert. Eine solche Befugnis steht dem realen Kapital, also dem Einzelkapital nicht zur Verfügung, noch hätte sie als Kommandogewalt eines Kapitalisten eine ausreichende Legitimationsbasis. Sie könnte also unter den Bedingungen der heutigen Gesellschaft das Verhältnis von Lohnarbeit und Kapital nicht einmal partiell regeln (im Rahmen eines einzelnen Betriebs), stünde sie nicht in der alleinigen Verfügung des Gesamtorganisators. So betrachtet, ist der Staat als politisches System kein „Agent” des Kapitals, auch wenn in besonderen geschichtlichen Situationen eine Regierung als Agentur einzelner Großkapitale und Monopole Partikularinteressen grob-sinnlich zum Erfolg verhilft. Es gibt ohne Frage Politiker, die schlichtweg bestochen sind; ebenso wie massive Druckversuche des Kapitals bei der Ausgestaltung der staatlichen Praktiken in der Wirtschafts-Han-dels-Außenhandelspolitik. Er, der Staat, kann kein Agent des Kapitals sein, weil das Gesamtkapital keine reale Größe ist, sondern eine allerdings reale Vermittlung - es sei denn, das Gesamtkapital fiele mit dem Gesamtorganisator zusammen. Er richtet sich nur punktuell nach dem Einzeldruck, im wesentlichen organisiert er die gesamtgesellschaftliche Reproduktion in der allgemeinen Linie des gemeinsamen Interesses aller Einzelkapitale an der Akkumulation.17 Das ist eine grobe Strukturierung, die im Einzelfall sicherlich der Spezifizierung bedarf. Zu fragen wäre z. B. nach den besonderen Beziehungen zwischen Gesamtorganisator und den einzelnen quantitativen Formen des Kapitals: Kleinkapital, Mittelkapitale, Monopole. Man soll sich auch vor der Mystik allgemeiner Ableitung hüten und dem Zufall, dem von Marx erwähnten, die Existenzberechtigung nicht absprechen. Bei der Ausgestaltung der Wirtschaftspolitik wie selbst bei der staatlich durchgesetzten Regelung der Produktionsverhältnisse stellen sich häufig unmittelbar gegebene, insofern nur künstlich ableitbare Beziehungen zwischen ökonomischen Gruppen und politischen Entscheidungsgremien ein. Ebenso können Politiker in der Anwendung ihrer formalen Macht zuweilen gegen Kapitalinteressen verstoßen, ohne daß das Kapital in der Lage sei, sie zur Ruhe zu setzen. Es liegt im objektiven Zusammenhang, ob formale Macht auch auf der Ebene der Kapitalreproduktion und nicht nur in Randbereichen sich verselbständigt und akkumulationswidrig verfährt. Das trifft zum Beispiel für eine ganze Reihe wesentlicher Entscheidungen der faschistischen Führung in Italien ab 1936 ebenso zu, wie für rein politisch motivierte, daher auch als „einsam” bezeichnete Beschlüsse des ersten Kanzlers der BRD (Röhrenembargo). Bleibt diese Möglichkeit des Verstoßes der Politik gegen die Ökonomie, d. h. im Grunde des Mißbrauchs politischer Macht außeracht, so verkommt das dialektische Verhältnis zur bloßen Mechanik, aus deren Sinnlosigkeit man sich nur durch phantasievolle Ableitungen retten kann. Vielmehr zeigen gerade diese Verstöße mehr als alle Abhängigkeit politischer Gruppen von den ökonomischen Erfordernissen, worin die Grenzen der formalen Macht des Staats liegen. Nicht die punktuelle Möglichkeit der Politik, sich akkumulationswidrig und kapitaldesinteressiert zu verhalten und zu entscheiden, macht die wirkliche Autonomie aus. Autonom handeln nur Politiker, die die Disfunktionalität ihrer Entscheidungen - Dis-funktionalität zur Akkumulation - durchhalten können. Gegen das rationale Programm des Kapitals kann jeder, auch ein Parteiführer und ein Staatsdiktator spinnen. Die Frage ist, wie lange man ihn spinnen läßt. Fehlt die Funktionalität und kündigt das Kapital das politische Bündnis mit der Staatsführung (also mit der stofflichen Seite des Staats) auf, so wird einem Regime oder einer Führungsgarnitur der Boden entzogen. Das gilt für den Übergang vom alten liberalen Staat zum faschistischen Regime und für die Restauration des parlamentarisch¬oligarchischen Staats im gleichen Maß. Wenn auch vorläufig festzuhalten ist, daß ein jedes bürgerliches System entweder personell oder strukturell transformiert wird, sobald es gegen den Akkumulationszwang verstößt, so bestimmt der gleiche Zwang auch die entgegenläufige Wirklichkeit des Staats - nicht als ökonomische, sondern als schlichte politische Potenz. Eine jede Befreiungsstrategie, die diese Ver doppelung der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft lediglich als Sache der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft ansieht und als deren Sorge; und da her entweder nur gegen das Kapital oder nur gegen dessen poli tische Organisation vorgeht oder - was noch schlimmer ist - ar beitsteilig den politischen und den ökonomischen Kampf trennt, scheitert am eigenen Realitätsverlust. Die FIAT-Arbeiter sahen die Realität genau in der Festlegung der Objektive ihres Kampfs: fabbrica e Stato. Zusammenfassend:”翻译为中文","output":"在这里，物质依赖与形式自立并不是抽象分离的对立面。它们在重要方面有所区别，例如在其掩饰特征方面。正是观点选择的可能性使整个关系变得模糊：遵循特定资本运动的东西，看起来像是自由的政治决策。然而，从形式上看，自治权则明显无遮掩地显现出来：它清晰可辨，乐于展示自己，因为正是它那公开的实施方式中蕴含着掩盖实际过程的能力。（即使是最强大的垄断也无法自行宣布法律。） 实际上，政治不断在这两极之间摇摆：形式上的权力也是实际的权力。此外，还有“偶然的合法性”（马克思，《 Grundrisse 》第30页），它随时可能导致意想不到的权力结构，从而扩大自治权的空间。在具体情况下，如果要规范的内容脱离了剩余价值的生产并直接关乎“国家公民”的私生活，形式上的权力本身就可能变成物质上的权力。当经济对政治失去直接兴趣时，政治就从物质依赖中解放出来。并不是每一个国家措施背后都有利润动机；也不是每一个法律都表现出某个资本派别转化为政治意志的结果。在这个虽然不是经济自由，但从资本的物质直接统治中解放出来的层面上，政治家、党派、道德协会、体育联合会和诗人等自由活动。但就作为一个整体组织者的角色而言，这种部分自治在意识形态上至少是有益的。政治被全面由利润动机决定的紧密性在某些地方被打破，声称国家致力于公共福利的方向更有说服力，如果这些领域的形式上的独立性首先是足够广泛的；第二，尤为重要的是，被公开传播。因此，这些领域在大众媒体中获得的不成比例的重视。以色情作品放行的讨论为例 - 这可能是一个完全不受经济压力影响的决策，有效地证明了一个政治系统的自由，其组织权力更多地服务于提高劳动强度和确认剥削关系。（或者也是这样：色情作品被放行；左翼激进分子被剥夺了职业权利，前提是 - 这里又是利润动机突显 - 一项职业的行使可以与组织装置的解放使用联系起来。） 然而，形式自立的最重要之处，在于它同时表现为形式的权力，并以此自我合法化（脱离阶级，在特定内容上不受约束的国家），在执行国家主要事务时，具体化为一种一般的组织权力。这样的权力不属于实际资本，即个别资本，甚至作为资本家的指挥权也没有足够的合法性基础。因此，在当今社会的条件下，这种权力甚至不能局部地调节劳动力和资本的关系（在单个企业范围内），如果它不是由总体组织者独自拥有的。 从这个角度看，国家作为一个政治系统并不是资本的“代理人”，即使在特定的历史情形中，一个政府作为单个大资本和垄断利益的代理机构，粗鲁地帮助特定利益实现成功。毫无疑问，有些政治人物被直接贿赂；就像资本在经济-贸易-外贸政策的国家实践中塑造中所施加的巨大压力。它，即国家，不能是资本的代理人，因为总资本不是一个实际的大小，而是一个虽然实际存在的媒介 - 除非总资本与总体组织者合而为一。它只是在个别压力下偶尔作出调整，本质上，它在所有单个资本共同积累利益的一般方向上组织整个社会的再生产。 这是一个需要在具体情况下进行细化的粗略结构。例如，应该询问总体组织者与资本的各个量化形式之间的特殊关系：小资本、中资本、垄断企业。我们还应该警惕对一般推导的神秘化，并且不应否认马克思提到的偶然性的合法性。在制定经济政策甚至在国家实施的生产关系规则中，经常会出现直接存在的、因此只能人为推导的经济集团与政治决策团体之间的关系。同样，政治家在使用其形式权力时，有时会违背资本利益，而资本无法让他们停下来。是否形式权力在资本再生产层面上自立，不仅仅在边缘领域自行其是并且阻碍积累，这取决于客观联系。例如，这适用于1936年以后意大利法西斯领导层的一系列重要决策，以及被称为“孤独”决策的联邦德国首位总理的纯粹出于政治动机的，因此也是孤立的措施（管道禁运）。如果忽略了政治违背经济的可能性，即实质上是滥用政治权力的情况，那么辩证关系就会沦为单纯的机械作用，从其无意义中只能通过富有想象力的推导来救赎自己。 更重要的是，这些违背行为比政治团体对经济要求的所有依赖都更能显示出国家形式权力的界限。不是政治有时能够违反积累原则和对资本无兴趣的决策和行为能力，构成了真正的自治。只有那些能够坚持他们的决策与积累的不功能性的政治家才是自主行动的。任何人，包括党领袖和国家独裁者，都可以反对资本的理性计划。关键问题是，他们能让你瞎忙多久。如果缺乏功能性并且资本中断了与国家领导（即国家的物质方面）的政治联盟，那么就会从一个政权或领导团队下撤底。这适用于从旧的自由主义国家到法西斯主义政权的过渡，以及恢复议会-寡头国家的过程同样适用。 即使目前应当记住的是，每一个资产阶级系统，一旦违反积累强制，不论是人员还是结构，都会被转变，但同样的强制也以一种非经济，而是简单的政治力量的形式决定了国家的相反现实。任何仅将这种资产阶级社会的复合性看作资产阶级社会的问题和关切的解放策略；因而要么只反对资本，要么只针对其政治组织，或者更糟的是 - 分开政治和经济斗争，都将因为丧失实际性而失败。FIAT工人在确定他们斗争目标时明确了现实：“fabbrica e Stato”。总结来说："},{"instruction":"请将“Die reale Funktion als Gesellschaftsplaner wächst dem Staat insofern aus der Kapitalbewegung zu, als der Akkumulationszwang die Tätigkeit des Kapitals auf die eigene Verwertung und Realisierung, also auf die bloß ökonomische Reproduktion einengt. Das wurde oben am Problem der Reproduktion der Arbeiter deutlich. Dies gilt erst recht bei der allgemeinen Verrecht-lichung des Klassenverhältnisses, sobald dieses sich als gesellschaftlicher Antagonismus darstellt und die Sphäre der unmittelbaren Mehrwertproduktion und der unmittelbaren Konfrontation im Betrieb überschreitet. Das Einzelkapital - selbst der größte Konzern - plant die Produktion von Mehrwert; kann u. U., allein oder über Kartellierung, selbst die Realisierung des Mehrwerts in Profiten auf den Markt planen. Es kann Formen und Intensität der Ausbeutung und auf diese Weise auch das unmittelbare Verhältnis vom konstanten zum variablen Kapital, die unmittelbare Klassenbeziehung im Betrieb zeitökonomisch und lohnpolitisch bis ins einzelne regeln und derart die Arbeiter in die Verwertung einplanen. Die für die Kontinuität seiner Produktion wichtigste Aufgabe entzieht sich aber seiner Planungsmöglichkeit. Das Einzelkapital schafft es nicht, soziale Auseinandersetzungen und Konflikte, zugespitzt: den Klassenkampf, planbar zu machen. Selbst bei geringfügigen Umweltkonflikten muß es bekanntlich die staatliche Vermittlung einschalten. Aus eigener Macht zwingt es zu massenhaftem Verkauf der Arbeitskraft, bringt aber gesellschaftliche Widersprüche und Widerstände nicht unter Kontrolle. Vielmehr ist seine eigene Reproduktion die Ursache solcher Konflikte und seiner Unfähigkeit, sie zu lösen - im gleichen Maß zum Beispiel, wie die Reproduktion zyklisch verläuft und soziale Krisen hervorruft. Auch hier: das Kapital bewältigt die eigene Wirklichkeit nicht. Aus ihm entsteht gesellschaftliche Anarchie, durch seinen Druck breitet sich Reproduktionschaos aus, entfalten sich Klassenkämpfe. Aus der ihm eigenen Kraft kann es aber weder gesellschaftliche Prozesse in der Hand halten noch gesellschaftliche Existenz organisatorisch sichern, noch Klassenkämpfe neutralisieren. Das leistet nur das organisatorische Gesamtsystem, der „Staat” in seinen wirklichen politischen Strukturen, die - um es noch einmal zu sagen - breiter und konkreter angelegt sind als das, was man üblicherweise Staatsorgane nennt. Hier zeichnen sich die entscheidenden Widersprüche ab. Die Unfähigkeit des Kapitals, mit der Desintegration in der Fabrik fertig zu werden und die Konflikte zu meistern, sowie die entsprechende Delegation der organisatorischen Macht an den Staat bedeutet keineswegs, daß der Riß langfristig oder gar endgültig zugenäht wäre. Wenn das Kapital die soziale Befriedung nicht schafft, und das bedeutet: als Einzelkapital sie weder finanzieren noch planmäßig durchführen kann (auf Grund sonst drohender Unterbrechung der eigenen Verwertung und also des Endes der eigenen Akkumulation); und der Staat die Krisenbewältigung übernimmt, so braucht sich der Erfolg nicht unbedingt einzustellen. Die Bedingungen von Erfolg oder Mißerfolg liegen vielmehr außerhalb des Befriedungs¬und Ordnungswillens des Staats wie außerhalb des Verwertungswillens des Kapitals, weil sie innerhalb des Produktionsprozesses und dessen staatlich besorgter Verrechtlichung, aber zugleich gegen sie sich erfüllen.18 Die Koppelung von Produktionsverhältnis und Verrechtlichung der Beziehungen in der Produktionssphäre, heute Bedingung für die Weiterexistenz des Kapitalismus, trägt in sich dieses vorantreibende negative Element. Hier verbinden sich in der Tat Fabrik und Staat. Die Desintegration in der Ökonomie (die Störung und Zerstörung des Produktionsflusses) trifft auch die Politik, wenn die Verrechtlichung und die Verstaatlichung der Konflikte im Betrieb und „in der Stadt” der Klassenoffensive nicht standhält. Die Arbeiter können sich durch Insubordination (den großen Schrecken, also Terror, vor dem sich die Bourgeoisie am meisten fürchtet) dem Ausbeutungsmechanismus der Fabrik und dem Machtmechanismus des Staats gleichzeitig entziehen.19 In solchen geschichtlichen Situationen ist eine Gesellschaft nicht mehr regierbar und Kapital nicht mehr verwertbar. Und umgekehrt: Gegenüber der Möglichkeit solcher Situationen muß der kapitalistische Staat durch langfristige institutionelle Strategien versuchen, die Voraussetzungen für die Regierbar- keit und Reproduzierbarkeit einer ökonomisch und sozial aus den Fugen sich begebenden Gesellschaft herzustellen und auf rechtzuerhalten. ' Der Realitätsgrad des Staats hängt von seiner Möglichkeit ab, Krisensituationen zu bewältigen, die die Kapitalakkumulation unvermeidlich hervorbringt. Man kann es freilich auch anders ausdrücken: von seiner Fähigkeit, Befreiungsbewegungen und die Tendenz zur Freiheit einzudämmen und zu neutralisieren. Der Staat - Gesellschaftsplaner und realer Kapitalist Wirtschaftskrisen und Unregierbarkeit einer Gesellschaft hängen geschichtlich gesehen nicht unbedingt zusammen. Ebenso wenig führen antizyklische Eingriffe des Staats zu einem Wechsel politischer Institutionen, nicht einmal zu einem Regierungswechsel. Fraglos bringen ökonomische Krisen die Widersprüche des Kapitals ans Licht, zeigen konkret seine Unfähigkeit, die eigene Wirklichkeit zu bewältigen und zugleich die Brüchigkeit seines Staats. Bei diesem wird vor allem die Labilität seiner Stellung zwischen konkurrierenden, der Rettung und der Reproduktionsgarantie bedürftigen Kapitale und Kapitalgruppierungen auf der einen Seite deutlich; wie auf der anderen Seite der Zwang, sich in dem Dilemma als Stütze einer Restmöglichkeit der Verwertung¬Existenzsicherung der Arbeiter (Währungsstabilität-Vollbeschäftigung) zu offenbaren. Eine „Staatskrise\\" folgt aber daraus nicht: das „Land” bleibt regierbar.20 Für die politischen Führungsgruppen tritt allerdings eine Erschwerung der spezifischen Aufgabe ein, allgemeine Erfordernisse der partiell unterbrochenen Akkumulation (die die durchgängige Abhängigkeit der Politik vom Kapital bedingen) und die dringender werdenden Forderungen der Einzelkapitale nach zumindest minimaler Profitsicherung untereinander auszugleichen. Die Lage - eine durchaus normale - kann aber gemeistert werden, selbst beim Auftreten sozialer Erschütterungen bleiben diese im Rahmen des resignierenden Protestes oder der ritualisierten gewerkschaftlichen Reaktion. Gegen einen zur punktuellen autonomen Aktion drängenden Protest reichen Manipulation und Unterdrückung als gewöhnliche Mittel zur Aufrechterhaltung der gesellschaftlichen Reproduktion vollauf aus. Gewiß kann sich in besonderen Situationen (Italien 1920-22; Deutschland 1933) die Rekonstruktion des normalen staatlichen Lebens mit einer auch konstitutionell gefaßten Veränderung des politischen Systems verbinden. Dies bedeutet aber lediglich, daß die Reproduktion nur auf der institutionellen Ebene in eine Krise geraten ist; und daß sie wieder in Gang gebracht wird durch entsprechende institutionelle Korrekturen. Auch in diesem Fall bleibt das Land regierbar, die korrigierten Spielregeln erfüllen ihre integrative Funktion und das Kapital regeneriert sich durch die Krise hindurch. Dies gilt allgemein für alle zyklischen Rezessionen. Die jetzige wird - sofern sie im ökonomischen verläuft - ebenso wenig zum Untergang des Kapitalismus führen wie die Weltwirtschaftskrise der 30er Jahre. Sie hat sicherlich ihren „wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen\\" Sinn: Sie räumt mit der Illusion einer antizyklischen Politik auf, die im intervenierenden Staat Keynesschen Typs monetäre Maßnahmen und psychische Investitionsreiz-Entwicklung als Garantie des Wachstums gefunden zu haben glaubte. Sie räumt auch mit Vorstellungen auf, die auf dem Umweg verschlungener Vermittlungen zur Doktrin des programmierbaren staatsmonopolistischen (Privat)kapitalismus geführt hatten.

Oder ob sie sich in dem Maße mit den „klassischen\\" Mitteln einer staatlichen Verwaltung ökonomischer Schwierigkeiten nicht mehr bewältigen läßt, in dem in den sozusagen normalen Ablauf kapitalistischer Zyklen ein Bruchfaktor nicht mehr rein ökonomischer Art eingebrochen ist und die Gesetzmäßigkeit der Kapitalbewegung von innen her über den Haufen geworfen hat. Daß die Wiederherstellung, vielmehr die erneute Erkennbarkeit des Konkurrenzverhältnisses auf dem Weltmarkt dabei eine entscheidende Rolle gespielt hat, hängt mit dem Totalitätscharakter der Produktionsweise zusammen: Die Unfähigkeit und die Widersprüchlichkeit des Kapitalismus wurden wieder ins Bewußtsein gehoben. Dennoch liegt die entscheidende Ursache nicht im Konkurrenzverhältnis. Maurice Dobb konnte neulich feststellen, daß selbst einer äußerlich gesehen rein wirtschaftlich¬monetären Erscheinung wie der Währungskrise und der Weltinflation in Wirklichkeit tiefer greifende Klassenkonflikte zugrunde liegen. (Diskussion in der Unita, 23., 28., 30. April und 4. Mai 1974.) In der Tat ist der „soziale Friede” in seinen vielfältigen Formen der Manipulation, der Integration, des sozialen Betrugs und der sozialen Errungenschaften inzwischen weltweit aufgekündigt worden. Wenn auch in verschiedener Stärke, je nach der besonderen geschichtlichen Lage der einzelnen kapitalistischen Nationalgesellschaften, meldet sich immer mehr die „Negation von Fabrik und Staat” an, überspringt günstige konjunkturelle Aufschwünge, verschärft die ökonomische Krise dort, wo diese aus der Kapitalbewegung entsteht - oder führt sie herbei, wenn sie sich zyklisch noch nicht einstellt. In einer solchen Situation nutzen alle Interventionsmöglichkeiten und Stabilitätsmaßnahmen des Staats nicht mehr viel, die Kapitalreproduktion noch zu retten. Die Negation zielt im Grunde weder auf Demokratisierung politischer Zustände und Institutionen noch auf eine „Humanisierung” der Mehrwertproduktion, noch - trotz Sorge um den Arbeitsplatz - auf die Wiederankurbelung der Ausbeutung. Als unlösliche Einheit von Befreiung und Befriedigung der Massenbedürfnisse setzt sie sich andere Ziele, die selbst dort revolutionär sind, wo das volle Bewußtsein ihres umwälzenden Charakters noch fehlt und sie in biederer Art als Umweltschutz¬Aktion (ein Beispiel für viele) ausgegeben wird. Analysiert man diese Ziele genau, hinter den zuweilen zweifellos unsicheren, rohen oder schillernden Erscheinungsformen, die sie annehmen - und die auch zu scheinbar irrationalen, bürgerlicher Betulichkeit nicht ganz geheuren Ausbrüchen zweideutiger Art führen können21 - so konkretisieren sie sich auf zwei Ebenen, auf denen die wesentlichen Prozesse der gesellschaftlichen Existenz stattfinden. Einmal vollzieht sich in der Sphäre der unmittelbaren Produktion, innerhalb der stofflichen Seite des Verhältnisses Kapital-Arbeit in zunehmend starkem Maß, auch wenn die Intensität von Land zu Land variiert, eine der Kapitalverwertung zuwiderlaufende Bewegung. Die „Arbeiterrebellion”, gesteigert zuweilen bis zur schlichten Arbeitsverweigerung selbst in Rezessionszeiten,22 zielt ohne die traditionelle politische Vermittlung, d. h. ohne repräsentative Organisationen dazwischen zu schalten darauf, die gewalttätig-degradierende Funktionalität des Verwertungsprozesses zu treffen, sie durch eine andere Form der Arbeit: durch freie, schöpferische Tätigkeit abzulösen. Der Aufstand des Arbeitsprozesses gegen den Verwertungsprozeß in der Produktion mag auch zur Humanisierung der Arbeit beitragen. In Wirklichkeit trifft er den Kern der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise und will sie nicht verbessern, sondern zerstören. Zerstörerisch - und daher zwingend unter Kontrolle zu bringen - sind die im Laufe der langjährigen Rebellion entwik- kelten Kampfformen. Sie konkretisieren sich vor allem in einer strategischen Linie der permanenten, autonomen Arbeitsunterbrechung und Arbeitsinsubordination, die - wie das italienische Beispiel zeigt - heute für die „normale”, das ist entlang ökonomischer Gesetzmäßigkeit verlaufende Reproduktion großer Kapitale (der Monopole) weitaus gefährlicher sind, als die rein politisch vermittelte Präsenz der Arbeiterklasse in den Instituten des bürgerlichen Staats. Zweitens: auf der Ebene gesamtgesellschaftlicher Prozesse setzt sich die Absage an die Verwertung fort in der umfassenderen Tendenz, nicht nur die Mehrwertproduktion in Frage zu stellen, sondern auch das ihr zugrundeliegende Produktionszzie/: die Schaffung von Tauschwerten. Die radikale Umwälzung des Produktionsziels vom Tauschwert zum Gebrauchswert, oder, wenn man so will: der Aufstand des Gebrauchswerts gegen den Tauschwert, hat bisher noch nicht die reifen Formen und den Grad der Bewußtheit erlangt, der sich bei der unmittelbaren Konfrontation zwischen Arbeit und Verwertung feststellen läßt. Es tut sich aber genug, um Kapital und Staat zu alarmieren. Wenn auch auf der untersten, spontanen Stufe der Bewußtseinsbildung, gehören viele konfliktuale Erscheinungen im Reproduktionsbereich: Häuserbesetzungen, Besetzung von Warenhäusern und Supermärkten, Forderungen nach Kinderstätten, Schulen, also nach den sozialen Diensten jenseits der Warenqualität, von Null-Punkt-Aktionen bis auf die - auf einer schon hohen Stufe der Bewußtheit - von den „Konsumenten” vorgenommenen Festsetzung der Waren und Güterpreise23 in den gleichen Negationszusammenhang, in dem in der Fabrik die ökonomische Zerstörung der Produktionsweise vorangetrieben wird. In diesem Zusammenhang verschwindet denn auch die nur theoretisch postulierte - in der abstrakten Analyse zuweilen sinnvolle, in der Praxis relativ belanglose - Scheidung von Produktionsbereich, in dem Mehrwert geschaffen wird und Reproduktionsbereich, wo Tauschwerte sich in Profite umsetzen. Fraglos lassen sich empirisch-soziologisch, innerhalb dieser einheitlichen Klassenfront, Differenzierungen, Spaltungen und immanente Konfliktsituationen ausfindig machen. Es kommen dabei Kriterien der Sozialforschung zur Geltung, die immer gegen den „Begriff” der Arbeiterklasse und den „Begriff” der Massen ins Feld geführt werden und die eindeutige Funktion haben, angesichts sozialer und politischer Krisen das fein strukturierte Gemüt der Bourgeoisie zu beruhigen. In der Tat: Mag der Klassenkampf noch so „toben”, mag die Produktion stok-ken und Bastionen des Imperialismus fallen: „wissenschaftlich” gesehen handelt es sich um geschichtliche Zufälle. Nun bieten solche Kriterien auch analytische Mittel zur genaueren Fassung der Klassenwirklichkeit vom Standpunkt der Arbeit (und nicht des Kapitals) aus und sind keineswegs lückenlos parteilich schon besetzt. Die Wirklichkeit als Totalität treffen sie jedoch nicht.24 Die Absage an die kapitalistische Produktionsweise, die in den letzten Jahren sich ausgebreitet hat, kennt keine Qualifi-kations- oder Einkommensschranken mehr.25 Angesichts dieser Situation, die zugleich Enthüllung des Wesens des Kapitalismus bedeutet und zur praktischen Kritik der politischen Ökonomie vom proletarischen Standpunkt aus führt, kommt das Kapital mit den gewöhnlichen Mitteln seines Staats nicht mehr aus. Die Notwendigkeit einer neuen institutionellen Strategie, die die Planung oder vielmehr die Planbarmachung solcher Vorgänge ermöglichen soll, gründet sich allerdings nicht machtpolitisch, sondern strikt ökonomisch. Sie wird durch die Transformation bedingt, die die kapitalistische Produktionsweise immanent erfahren hat und die das Kapital unter einen durch die wieder mit voller Geltung aufgetretene Weltmarktkonkurrenz unausweichlich gewordenen Planungszwang gestellt hat - wobei es praktisch völlig belanglos ist, ob sich die Planung der einzelen Kapitale erfolgreich durchsetzen kann. Im wesentlichen handelt es sich um zwei Grundbedingungen, die die Planung erzwingen und die genau den zwei Rebellionsmomenten zuwiderlaufen. Die zunehmende Konzentration und Zentralisation der Kapitale (bis hin zur Erscheinungsform der Monopolbildung) erfordert dringend eine stärkere Durchsetzbarkeit der Tauschwertorientierung gegen die Befriedigung von Massenbedürfnissen. Das Kapital, namentlich das Großkapital kann sich heute weniger denn je leisten, sich dem Druck von „Massenwünschen” zu beugen und seine Selbstverwertung sozialen Diensten, Aufgaben und Ausgaben zu opfern.”翻译为中文","output":"问题只在于，经济衰退是否仅限于经济范畴，是否完全可以归因于已经充分理论阐明的周期性原因。或者说，当传统的国家管理经济困难的“典型”手段不再有效时，是否因为某种非纯经济性的断裂因素已经突然介入所谓的资本主义周期的正常流程中，从内部颠覆了资本运动的规律性。全球市场上竞争关系的恢复，乃至其再次变得可识别，在这方面扮演了决定性角色，这关联到生产方式的总体特性：资本主义的无能和矛盾再次被提升到意识中。然而，决定性原因并不在于竞争关系。Maurice Dobb最近发现，即使是看似纯粹是经济-货币性的现象，如货币危机和全球性通货膨胀，实际上背后是更深层次的阶级冲突。（在Unita上的讨论，1974年4月23日、28日、30日和5月4日。） 实际上，“社会和平”在其多种形式的操纵、整合、社会欺骗和社会成果方面，现已在全球范围内被终止。尽管实力各异，这取决于各个资本主义国家的具体历史状况，但“工厂和国家的否定”正日益显化，跨越了有利的经济周期，加剧了从资本运动中产生的经济危机 - 或者在周期性还未出现时引发危机。在这样的情况下，国家所有的干预可能性和稳定措施已无济于事，无法再救赎资本再生产。这种否定根本上既不针对政治状况及机构的民主化，也不针对剩余价值生产的“人性化”，甚至 - 尽管关心工作岗位 - 也不是为了重新启动剥削。作为解放和满足群众需求不可分割的统一体，它设定了其它目标，即使在缺乏完全革命性特征意识的情况下，这些目标在本质上也是革命性的，就像以环保行动（众多例子中的一个）的温和方式呈现的一样。 如果精确分析这些目标，在它们有时无疑是不确定的、粗糙的或闪烁的表现形式之后 - 这也可能导致表面上看似非理性、对于资产阶级来说并不完全符合传统的爆发 - 它们在发生社会存在基本过程的两个层面上具体化。 一方面，在直接生产领域内，即在资本-劳动关系的物质方面，发生了一种越来越强烈的、与资本增值相反的运动，即使这种强度因国家而异。“工人反抗”，有时甚至在经济衰退期间升级为简单的拒绝工作，不通过传统的政治中介，即不插入代表性组织，直接打击增值过程的暴力-贬低功能性，以另一种形式的工作：自由的、创造性的活动来替代之。生产中针对增值过程的反抗可能也有助于劳动的人性化。实际上，它触及了资本主义生产方式的核心，并且不是要改良它，而是要摧毁它。多年来反抗运动中发展出来的战斗形式是具有破坏性的 - 因此必须被控制 - 它们主要具体化为一种战略线路：持续的、自治的工作中断和工作不服从，正如意大利的例子所示，今天对于“正常”的、即沿经济规律发展的大资本（垄断）的再生产来说，比工人阶级在资产阶级国家机构中纯粹政治介入更加危险。 第二，在全社会过程的层面上，对增值的拒绝在更广泛的倾向中继续，不仅质疑剩余价值生产，而且也质疑它的基础：创造交换价值的生产目标。从交换价值到使用价值的生产目标的根本转变，或者说，使用价值对交换价值的反抗，尚未达到直接对抗中工作与增值间发现的成熟形式和意识程度。但已经足以警告资本和国家。即使在意识形态最初级、自发阶段，诸多冲突现象在再生产领域出现：占领房屋、占领商场和超市、要求建立儿童托育所、学校，即对商品质量之外的社会服务的需求，从零起始行动到“消费者”设定商品和服务价格的高意识形态阶段，都属于同一否定框架，同在工厂中推进对生产方式的经济破坏。在这一背景下，仅在理论上提出的、在抽象分析中有时有意义、在实践中相对无关紧要的生产领域与剩余价值转化为利润的再生产领域的区分也就消失了。 无疑，在这一统一的阶级前线内，可以从经验社会学角度发现分化、分裂和内在冲突情况。在此，社会研究的标准发挥作用，它们总是用来反对“工人阶级”的“概念”和“群众”的“概念”，并具有明确的功能，在面对社会和政治危机时安抚资产阶级的精致心态。事实上：不管阶级斗争如何“激烈”，不管生产如何停顿，不管帝国主义的堡垒如何倒下：“科学地”看，这些都是历史偶然。现在，这些标准也提供了从劳动（而不是资本）的视角更准确捕捉阶级现实的分析工具，并不是完全片面占据。然而，它们并没有触及现实的整体。最近几年扩散的对资本主义生产方式的拒绝不再认识资格或收入的界限。 面对这种情况，同时暴露了资本主义的本质，并导致了从无产阶级立场出发对政治经济学的实践批判，资本无法再使用其国家的常规手段。对一种新的制度策略的需求，并不是建立在权力政治上，而是严格建立在经济上。这是由资本主义生产方式内在经历的转变所决定的，而这种转变使得资本因重新出现的世界市场竞争而不可避免地面临规划压力 - 实际上，无论单个资本的规划是否能成功实施都完全无关重要。本质上，规划的强制性基于两个基础条件，这些条件正好与两个叛逆时刻相抵触。日益增加的资本集中和中心化（直至形成垄断的表现形式）迫切要求更强地实施对交换价值取向的推动，而不是满足群众需求。资本，尤其是大资本，今天比以往任何时候都更无法向“群众愿望”的压力屈服，牺牲自我增值以支持社会服务、任务和支出。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Both shows cater to a young audience and have their own fanbases, but their popularity can vary significantly across different countries and demographics. \\"Skunk Fu!\\" is an Irish/British animated television series that debuted in 2007. It has a distinct style and revolves around an anthropomorphic skunk named Skunk and his adventures in ancient China. The show focuses on themes of martial arts and the battle between good and evil. On the other hand, \\"Monster Allergy\\" is based on the Italian comic book series of the same name and was first broadcast in 2005. It follows the story of a young boy named Ezekiel Zick (commonly known as Zick) who has the ability to see and combat monsters. This series has a broader European influence, given its Italian origins, and has been popular in Italy and other parts of Europe. Popularity can fluctuate over time and across different media platforms. \\"Monster Allergy\\" might be more well-known in Europe, especially in Italy, due to its origins and broader broadcast coverage in European countries. \\"Skunk Fu!\\" might have a more specific audience due to its unique setting and style. With streaming services and digital platforms becoming a primary way for audiences to discover and watch television series, the accessibility of these shows can significantly impact their current popularity. If either series is available on a popular streaming service, this could boost its visibility and familiarity among newer audiences. In summary, it's difficult to definitively say which show is more well-known universally. The answer could vary depending on regional preferences, age demographics, and the current availability of each show on popular media platforms."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I miss watching that show. User2: I’m not sure, but hopefully it will return soon. It was a fun show to watch in the mornings. User1: Yeah, it really was. I’ll have to keep an eye out for any updates on when it might come back. User2: In the meantime, have you checked out the CBBC section on the BBC website? There’s a surprise at the top cartoon in the iPlayer section. User1: No, I haven’t seen it yet. What’s the surprise? User2: Believe it or not, Skunk Fu is currently the top cartoon on the iPlayer section! It seems like the early morning show is gaining even more popularity. User1: That’s amazing! Who would have thought that a forgotten cartoon would become such a hit. I’ll have to check it out on the iPlayer soon. Write a follow up where the outlook for 2016 is revealed, Of course new eps of Next Step, Ouch, Dumping Ground, but some surprising renewals User1: Just saw the outlook for CBBC’s programming for the rest of 2016. As expected, new episodes of The Next Step, Operation Ouch!, and The Dumping Ground are coming. User2: That’s cool, those shows always pull in good viewership. But did they mention anything about unexpected renewals? User1: Yes, actually. They’re bringing back some shows that we haven’t seen in a while. User2: Really? Which ones? User1: Surprisingly, they’re renewing Skunk Fu for a new season after its unexpected popularity surge. Also, there’s talk of bringing back The Owl & Co. later in the year due to demand. User2: That’s amazing news! Skunk Fu has really made a remarkable comeback, and it’s great to hear about The Owl & Co. I’ve missed that one. User1: Plus, they’re even considering reviving some other nostalgic shows based on viewer feedback. CBBC seems to be taking a mix of new and retro to keep the audience engaged. User2: Sounds like 2016 is going to be an exciting year for CBBC. Between the new episodes of current hits and the return of beloved classics, there’s going to be something for everyone. User1: Definitely. It’ll be interesting to see how these returning shows fare alongside the current lineup. CBBC is really shaking things up! Write a follow up where effective May 7 its gonna air in the afternoons, so finally kiss NYSI goodbye, Also 7pm’s OO (Makes for a funny shift after the competition of Next Step), Here’s that new lineup User1: Have you heard about the new schedule shift on CBBC effective May 7th? User2: No, what’s changing this time? User1: They’re going to start airing shows in the afternoons, so it looks like we’re finally saying goodbye to Now You See It (NYSI). User2: Oh, wow! I did enjoy NYSI, but change could be good. What’s the new lineup looking like? User1: Quite interesting actually. They’re moving some shows around to fit the afternoon slots. Even Operation Ouch! is moving to the 7pm slot, which is a funny shift, especially right after the competition of The Next Step. User2: Operation Ouch! at 7pm? That’s going to be an amusing transition from dance drama straight into medical mysteries. What else is on the new schedule? User1: Here’s what I’ve gathered for the new afternoon to evening lineup: 3:00pm - Horrible Histories 3:30pm - Shaun the Sheep 3:45pm - Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed 4:00pm - The Deep 4:30pm - The Next Step 5:00pm - Hetty Feather 5:30pm - Millie Inbetween 6:00pm - So Awkward 6:30pm - Jamie Johnson 7:00pm - Operation Ouch! User2: That’s a solid afternoon into evening slot! It’s going to be great having these options during the afternoon, especially for those looking for some entertainment after school. User1: Exactly. And with Operation Ouch! closing out the evening, it’s sure to bring in a broad range of viewers with its unique blend of education and humor. User2: I can’t wait to see how this new schedule pans out. It’s always refreshing to see CBBC adapting and changing things up to keep the content engaging for its audience. User1: Definitely. And who knows? Maybe the shake-up will bring in some surprises success stories like Skunk Fu’s revival. CBBC seems to have a good sense for these things. Write a follow up where our suprise reunited friend is moving past the mornings, booting Millie off, Also the 4:30 Next Step, which is moving to 6pm, so no more So Awkward User1: Just saw the latest on the CBBC schedule shake-up come May 7th. You’re not going to believe who’s moving past the early mornings. User2: No way, who’s making the big jump? User1: Skunk Fu! That surprise hit we’ve been talking about. It’s getting promoted out of the early morning slot and is set to replace Millie Inbetween in the afternoon lineup. User2: That’s incredible for Skunk Fu fans! But a bummer for those who love Millie Inbetween. Seems like a big change, anything else? User1: Yeah, there’s more. Because of Skunk Fu moving up, The Next Step is getting pushed to the 6pm slot, which means So Awkward is no longer on the lineup. User2: Whoa, The Next Step at 6pm is huge! But it’s a real shock about So Awkward. It had a solid run though. The evening slot for The Next Step will definitely grab more viewers. User1: Here’s how the revised lineup is shaping up for the afternoons to early evening: 3:00pm - Horrible Histories 3:30pm - Shaun the Sheep 3:45pm - Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed 4:00pm - The Deep 4:30pm - Skunk Fu! 5:00pm - Hetty Feather 5:30pm - Jamie Johnson 6:00pm - The Next Step 7:00pm - Operation Ouch! User2: Skunk Fu at 4:30 is going to attract a lot of attention. It’s quite the Cinderella story, from being a forgotten early morning show to prime afternoon viewing. User1: Definitely, and The Next Step moving to 6pm is strategic. It’s prime time for their target audience. Plus, Operation Ouch! keeping its 7pm slot ensures the evening ends on an educational note. User2: True, this lineup really shakes things up. I’ll miss So Awkward and Millie Inbetween but am excited for Skunk Fu and the new opportunities for The Next Step. CBBC isn’t shying away from making bold moves. User1: That’s CBBC for you, always evolving. It’s going to be interesting to see how the audience responds to these changes.

Write a forum convo where an ad announcing the changes has the song “I Don’t Feel Like Dancing” User1: Hey everyone, have you seen the new ad for the CBBC schedule changes? They actually used the song “I Don’t Feel Like Dancing” in it. 😂 User2: Really? That’s hilarious! 😆 Such a cheeky choice considering they’ve just moved Skunk Fu to the 4:30pm slot for the crowd that’s coming home and probably doesn’t feel like dancing right away. User3: Genius marketing move if you ask me. It perfectly captures that afternoon mood when all you want is to chill and enjoy some fun TV instead of being overly active. Plus, mentioning the schedule changes in such an entertaining way is bound to get more attention. User4: Definitely caught my attention. I’ve been following the #DancersNeed6pm discussions, and seeing The Next Step moved to 6pm makes the song choice even more poignant. It’s like they’re saying, “We get you, now relax and enjoy.” User5: The song choice is spot on. Between coming home from school or work, sometimes all you need is a good laugh without any pressure. Props to CBBC for understanding their audience so well. Also, excited that The Next Step has found its perfect timing. It feels like the channel is really in tune with viewers’ rhythm. User6: I wonder if there’s a deeper message here. Like, it’s okay not to feel like dancing or being super energized all the time. Sometimes, kicking back with shows like Skunk Fu and unwinding is just what’s needed. Love how they’re making the schedule more inclusive for different moods and moments of the day. User7: Agreed, @User6. It’s a subtle but effective way to remind us that TV can match our energy level, whatever it may be. With this revamp, CBBC is telling us that whatever mood we’re in, there’s something for us. Also, can’t wait to see how the audience reacts to these changes over time. User8: Does anyone know if the song choice will be a regular thing for CBBC ads now? I think incorporating popular songs that resonate with the audience’s current vibe could be a fresh way to keep the channel’s promotions engaging and relatable. User9: That’s an interesting thought, @User8. If the feedback on this ad is anything to go by, it would be a smart strategy. Mixing in relevant music with their announcements could indeed make their future campaigns stand out. Plus, it adds an extra layer of fun to TV schedule updates, which isn’t something you see very often. User10: Caught the ad after school today, and it put such a big smile on my face. It’s refreshing to see a network use humor and clever song choices to connect with its audience. Makes the whole TV-watching experience feel more personalized and thoughtful. Kudos to CBBC! Write a follow up where the SF ad has “IDFLD” wheras the TNS ad has “Take your Mama”, The 2 ads both have one thing in common regarding the songs User1: Just noticed something cool about the CBBC ads for Skunk Fu and The Next Step. The Skunk Fu ad uses “I Don’t Feel Like Dancing” while The Next Step ad went with “Take Your Mama.” Both songs are by Scissor Sisters! User2: Oh wow, that’s a brilliant catch, @User1! I hadn’t connected the dots on that. So both ads are tapping into Scissor Sisters’ tracks. That’s a clever way to maintain consistency and still cater to the mood of each show. User3: Absolutely, it’s like CBBC is creating a mini-theme with Scissor Sisters songs. “I Don’t Feel Like Dancing” perfectly fits the laid-back, chill vibe they’re going for with Skunk Fu. Meanwhile, “Take Your Mama” for The Next Step is such an energetic and motivating pick, ideal for getting pumped up about dancing. User4: It’s smart marketing for sure. Using Scissor Sisters tracks across different ads gives a sense of unity in their campaign, yet each song choice finely highlights the essence of the respective shows. Plus, it’s a nod to parents who might recognize the songs, inviting a wider audience. User5: That’s the genius part—reaching out to both kids and their parents with music that crosses generational lines. It makes the shows feel more accessible. “Take Your Mama” especially has that vibe of encouragement and fun that matches The Next Step’s theme of pursuing your passion. User6: It also introduces younger viewers to some awesome tunes they might not have heard before. It’s a win-win. The parents get a bit of nostalgia, and the kids get catchy songs that enrich the viewing experience. CBBC’s been on point with these music choices! User7: Makes me wonder if they’ll continue using Scissor Sisters songs for other shows or promotions. It’s a neat way to build a unique identity for the channel’s advertising. Plus, the upbeat, positive vibes of their music fit the overall CBBC brand perfectly. User8: Agreed, @User7. Also, using such recognizable music could make the ads more memorable. You hear a Scissor Sisters song later, and it might just remind you of either Skunk Fu or The Next Step, reinforcing the connection to the shows. User9: Exactly, @User8! It’s like conditioning in a way—pair something memorable (like a catchy tune) with what you’re promoting, and people are more likely to recall it. Smart strategy, CBBC. These ads have definitely left an impression. User10: It all adds up to a smart and cohesive marketing strategy by CBBC. Clever use of music, especially songs that can energize or relax, depending on the time of day and the program. It’ll be interesting to see how this approach evolves. Kudos to CBBC for keeping things fresh and engaging! Write a follow up where they are giving away plushes of Rabbit","output":"User1: Hey, has anyone seen the latest CBBC giveaway? They're actually giving away plushes of Rabbit from Skunk Fu! User2: Really? That's so cool! Rabbit is such an underrated character. How do we enter? User1: It's part of their promotion for the new schedule. You have to answer a question about the Skunk Fu show on their website and then you're in the draw to win one of the plushes. User3: That's a smart move from CBBC, tying in a giveaway with the promotion of their schedule change. It seems like they're really going all out with this Skunk Fu resurgence. User4: Definitely. Considering the show's newfound popularity, it's a great way to engage the audience further. Plus, who wouldn't want a Rabbit plush? He's got to be one of the best characters on the show. User5: Agreed, @User4. It’s also clever of CBBC to use merchandise like plush toys to attract attention. It not only promotes Skunk Fu but makes the channel more relatable and fun for viewers. User6: Has anyone managed to win one of those plushes yet? I sent in my answer but haven't heard back. Fingers crossed though! User7: Not yet, @User6. But I read that they’re not just giving away Rabbit plushes. They hinted at more Skunk Fu character plushes coming up for grabs in the future. Makes you wonder if they’re planning to expand the show’s merch line. User8: That would be amazing if they did, @User7! Skunk Fu has such a unique cast of characters. Having a collection of them would be awesome. It’s also a great way to keep the show in the minds of fans, long after they've seen the episodes. User9: Also, this giveaway could serve as a feedback loop for CBBC. If they see a lot of interest in Skunk Fu merchandise, it might influence further content creation or even lead to more in-depth merchandising efforts for other shows as well. User10: True, @User9. It's all interconnected. High engagement typically leads to more content and merch. Plus, giveaways like this build a strong community around the channel and its shows. I just hope they keep the momentum going and maybe introduce some interactive online content related to Skunk Fu and other popular shows."},{"instruction":"Feel the Rhythm label française - artiste notables :","output":"\\"Feel the Rhythm\\" est un label qui peut être associé à la musique house, electro et à d'autres genres électroniques.

Et puis, aidé en cela par le déclin du jour et le visage presque apaisé de sa grand-mère. il trouva des souvenirs plus précis et des confidences moins faciles. Il lui raconta pourquoi il s'était séparé de sa petite amie et comment s'appelait celle qu'il avait dans le collimateur, ses progrès en cuisine, sa fatigue... I imita son nouveau colocataire et entendit sa grand-mère rire doucement. - Tu exagères... - Je te jure que non !

Приехав после времени посещений, он настоял и смог войти, чтобы увидеть её. Внук успокаивает бабушку, рассказывая ей, что она останется в больнице на некоторое время, прежде чем перейти в реабилитационный центр, и обещает посетить её. Они разговаривают о разных вещах — о его жизни, работе, друзьях и планах, что способствует успокоению бабушки. Эмоциональный обмен между ними показывает глубокую связь и заботу внука о бабушке, которая также выражает беспокойство из-за ощущаемых болей и страх перед ночью в одиночестве. Внук обещает поговорить с медсестрой о снятии боли перед уходом и успокаивает бабушку, говоря, что она скоро поправится. Наконец, они касаются темы его матери, которую бабушка сознательно не уведомила о ситуации, что даёт понять о сложных семейных отношениях. В конце внук уходит, оставляя бабушку спать, и обещает скорое исцеление, символизируя теплоту, заботу и поддержку, которые он готов предоставить, несмотря на собственные трудности и заботы."},{"instruction":"Hola asistente.

This sensation occurs due to the temporary compression of the peripheral nerves. When you sit or stand in a position that puts pressure on a nerve or restricts blood flow to the nerves, the oxygen supply to the nerve cells is reduced or cut off. This interference with the nerve function leads to the sensation of numbness or that \\"asleep\\" feeling in the affected limb. As the pressure is released and blood flow starts to return to normal, the nerves begin to awaken and send signals to the brain and spinal cord. These signals can be erratic at first due to the sudden influx of blood, leading to the uncomfortable, tingling, or prickly sensation as the nerves recover. The feeling is essentially your nerve cells communicating to your brain that they are coming back online after being temporarily out of service. This phenomenon is usually temporary and harmless, resolving on its own once normal blood flow and nerve function are restored. However, experiencing it frequently or without an apparent cause can be indicative of underlying health conditions that may require medical attention."},{"instruction":"답변을 한국어로 번역","output":"혈류가 제한된 다리에 혈류가 다시 돌기 시작할 때 따끔거리는 이유는 일시적으로 압박된 주변 신경 때문입니다. 이러한 감각은 흔히 \\"바늘로 찌르는 듯한\\" 느낌으로 묘사되며, 의학적으로는 \\"감각이상\\"이라고 합니다. 어떤 자세로 앉거나 서서 신경에 압력을 가하거나 신경으로 가는 혈류를 제한하면, 그 신경 세포로의 산소 공급이 줄어들거나 차단됩니다. 이는 신경 기능에 장애를 일으켜 해당 사지에 저림이나 \\"잠이 든\\" 느낌을 초래합니다. 압력이 해제되고 혈류가 정상으로 돌아가기 시작하면, 신경들이 깨어나서 뇌와 척수에 신호를 보내기 시작합니다. 처음에는 갑자기 혈액이 유입되면서 신경들이 보내는 신호가 일정하지 않을 수 있어, 신경들이 회복되면서 불편한 따끔거림이나 찌르는 듯한 감각이 발생합니다. 이 느낌은 사실상 신경 세포들이 일시적으로 서비스를 중단한 후 다시 온라인 상태로 돌아온다고 뇌에 통신하는 것입니다. 이 현상은 보통 일시적이고 무해하며, 정상적인 혈류와 신경 기능이 복원되면 스스로 해결됩니다. 그러나 명백한 원인 없이 자주 경험한다면, 이는 의학적인 주의가 필요한 근본적인 건강 상태를 나타낼 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"제가 지금부터 가사를 적으면 이 가사가 어떤 내용인지 짦게 적은후 가사 원문과 한글 번역을 원문 한줄 번역 한줄 원문 한줄 번역 한줄 이런식으로 적어주세요.를 영어로 번역","output":"If I now write down the lyrics, please briefly describe their content and then translate the original lyrics and their Korean translation by alternating each line of the original with its translation, like this: original line, translation, original line, translation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Turn these contents into present speech","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, we stand at a crucial juncture where the debate over the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme grips our community. The contrast in views among our pressure groups is stark, underscoring the diverse sentiments coursing through the fabric of our industry and its stakeholders. On one side, we have the vocal opposition from esteemed organizations such as the Eating Establishment Employees General Union, the Hotels, Food and Beverage Employees Association, the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, and the Society for Community Organization. Their concerns reflect a deep apprehension towards introducing foreign workers under the scheme, fearing adverse impacts on our local workforce. Conversely, entities like The Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners and the Laundry Association of Hong Kong have shown support, viewing the scheme as a potential remedy to the acute labor shortages we face. This divergence in perspectives has ignited a robust public discourse. Opposing groups, through interviews and public statements, have elevated the conversation around industry challenges like staff shortages, low pay, and poor working conditions. They argue that overlooking these issues could severely affect our industry's future sustainability. Their advocacy for prioritizing local employment and enhancing job attractiveness through better remuneration and working conditions is a clarion call for industry reform. In parallel, supported groups posit that the scheme is a necessary step towards alleviating the pressure on our strained labor market, promising a path to continued growth and prosperity. The impact on public opinion is palpable. These debates have fostered a heightened awareness around the scheme and the broader industry dilemmas, shaping public sentiment and influencing perspectives across our community. Both factions have not shied away from engaging with the media, leveraging it as a pivotal platform to relay their concerns, suggestions, and narratives. This media focus has proven instrumental in broadening the reach of their messages, influencing public perceptions, and setting expectations for governmental action. In essence, the discourse around the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme has spurred a vibrant debate on policy directions, with pressure groups pushing for government intervention to tackle the challenges head-on. Their concerted efforts aim to influence the policy-making process, advocating for solutions that not only address the immediate labor shortages but also ensure the long-term sustainability and attractiveness of our industry. As we navigate through these discussions, it is imperative for all stakeholders to engage constructively, appreciating the complexity of the issues at hand and striving for solutions that safeguard the interests of our local workforce while ensuring the industry's growth and competitiveness.

Убедитесь, что вы пьёте достаточное количество воды, чтобы восстановить водный баланс. 2. **Сон**. Обеспечьте себе качественный и полноценный отдых. Сон — это ключевой компонент восстановления организма. 3. **Питание**. Сбалансированное питание, богатое витаминами и минералами, будет способствовать более быстрому восстановлению. Добавьте в рацион больше фруктов, овощей, белков и цельнозерновых продуктов. 4. **Лёгкая физическая активность**.

Вот несколько конкретных рекомендаций по восстановлению после употребления фенибута в дополнение к ранее предложенным: 1. **Постепенное уменьшение дозы** (если вы регулярно употребляли фенибут и испытываете зависимость). Резкое прекращение приема может вызвать симптомы отмены. Важно делать это под медицинским наблюдением. 2. **Консультация с врачом**. Если вы чувствуете психологическую или физическую зависимость от фенибута, обязательно обратитесь за медицинской помощью. Врач поможет вам разработать план постепенного отказа от препарата с минимальными рисками. 3. **Поддержка нервной системы**. Витамины группы B, омега-3 жирные кислоты, магний и другие добавки могут помочь в поддержке нервной системы.

将学习率衰减策略应用于损失函数权重。随着训练的进行，逐渐减小对某些损失函数的关注度，或相反，根据需求增加对特定损失函数的关注。 2. **基于性能的调整（Performance-based Adjustment）**： - 根据验证集上的性能动态调整不同损失的比重。例如，如果某个任务的性能提升不明显，可以增加与该任务相关的损失权重。 3. **注意力机制（Attention Mechanism）**： - 类似于注意力机制在模型架构中的作用，可以设计一个网络结构来动态地学习不同损失权重的分配，其中网络的输入是当前的训练状态或性能指标。 4. **预设的条件调整（Predefined Conditional Adjustment）**： - 根据预设条件动态调整损失权重，这些条件可能包括训练迭代次数、特定的性能指标阈值等。例如，一开始可以让模型更多地关注基本任务的学习，然后随着训练的深入，渐渐增加对细节或高级特性的关注。 5. **温度调整（Temperature Scaling）**： - 通过对损失函数中的某些部分应用温度系数（一个可调的参数），动态调整其重要性。这一技巧常见于知识蒸馏领域，通过调整温度参数来平衡“软标签”的影响力。 6. **多任务学习中的自适应权重调整（Adaptive Weight Adjustment in Multi-task Learning）**： - 在多任务学习框架中，已有研究提出了不同的自适应机制来动态调整任务间的权重。这些技术也可以借鉴来调整中间层输出的损失权重，一种常见的方法是基于梯度大小自动调整。 无论采取哪种方法，重要的是设计一个合理的策略来评估不同损失之间的影响并相应调整，以确保模型能够有效学习到教师模型提供的各种层次的知识。此外，实验和验证是这一过程中不可或缺的部分，因为不同的任务和架构可能需要不同的调整策略。"},{"instruction":"python format格式输出如何设置保留小数点后几位","output":"在Python中，可以通过\`format\`方法或者f-string（Python 3.6及以上版本）来设置保留小数点后几位的格式输出。以下是一些示例： # 使用\`format\`方法 \`\`\`python # 假设有一个浮点数 number = 123.456789 # 使用format方法保留小数点后两位 formatted_number = format(number, '.2f') print(formatted_number) # 输出：123.46 # 使用format方法保留小数点后四位 formatted_number = format(number, '.4f') print(formatted_number) # 输出：123.4568 \`\`\` 在\`format\`方法中，\`.2f\`和\`.4f\`指定了浮点数的格式，其中，\`.2\`和\`.4\`指保留小数点后两位和四位，\`f\`表示浮点数格式化。 # 使用f-string 从Python 3.6开始，可以使用f-string来完成相似的任务，这通常更加简洁方便： \`\`\`python # 假设有一个浮点数 number = 123.456789 # 使用f-string保留小数点后两位 formatted_number = f\\"{number:.2f}\\" print(formatted_number) # 输出：123.46 # 使用f-string保留小数点后四位 formatted_number = f\\"{number:.4f}\\" print(formatted_number) # 输出：123.4568 \`\`\` 在f-string表达式中，\`{number:.2f}\`和\`{number:.4f}\`的语法与\`format\`方法中的语法相似，实现了相同的输出控制。 # 总结 无论是使用\`format\`方法还是f-string，都可以通过修改格式说明符（如\`.2f\`和\`.4f\`）来控制浮点数保留小数点后几位的精度。f-string因其简洁性和易读性，成为了Python 3.6及以上版本中推荐的格式化字符串的方法。"},{"instruction":"pytorch如何设置不同参数采用不同的学习率","output":"在PyTorch中，如果你想给不同的参数（例如不同层的权重）设置不同的学习率，可以在优化器（如\`torch.optim.Adam\`或\`torch.optim.SGD\`等）的构造函数中传递一个参数组（parameter groups）列表。每个参数组是一个字典，包含\`'params'\`键（指定参数列表）以及这些参数特定的优化选项，如学习率（\`'lr'\`）。 这使得在模型的不同部分实施不同的学习策略（例如，对预训练的部分使用较小的学习率，对新添加的层使用较大的学习率）变得可能。 以下是一个示例，展示了如何使用PyTorch为不同的模型参数设置不同的学习率： \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim class MyModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(MyModel, self).__init__() self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 20) self.layer2 = nn.Linear(20, 30) def forward(self, x): x = self.layer1(x) x = self.layer2(x) return x # 实例化模型 model = MyModel() # 假设我们想给layer1设定不同的学习率 layer1_lr = 0.01 layer2_lr = 0.001 # 定义参数组 optimizer = optim.Adam([ {'params': model.layer1.parameters(), 'lr': layer1_lr}, {'params': model.layer2.parameters(), 'lr': layer2_lr} ]) \`\`\` 在这个例子中，我们首先定义了一个包含两个线性层的简单模型。接着，我们通过创建一个列表，其中包含两个字典，每个字典指定一组参数及其相应的学习率，来构建一个\`Adam\`优化器。这样，\`layer1\`的参数会使用学习率\`0.01\`进行优化，而\`layer2\`的参数会使用学习率\`0.001\`进行优化。 这种方法为模型的不同部分提供了灵活的学习策略，在微调预训练模型或设计复杂的模型训练过程时特别有用。你可以根据需要调整不同层或参数组的学习率，以优化训练过程和模型性能。"},{"instruction":"pytorch想让某一层的学习率变小，其他层学习率不变怎么操作","output":"要在PyTorch中设置某一层的学习率较低，而其他层的学习率保持不变，可以在配置优化器时，将模型参数划分为两组：一组包含你想要降低学习率的那一层的参数，另一组包含其他所有层的参数。然后，为这两组参数指定不同的学习率。这可以通过在优化器（如\`torch.optim.SGD\`、\`torch.optim.Adam\`等）的构造函数中传入一个参数组（parameter groups）的列表来实现。 这里是一个具体的示例，假设你有一个名为\`model\`的PyTorch模型，并且希望为\`model.layer_to_slow\`的参数设置较低的学习率，而模型中的其他所有参数保持默认的学习率不变： \`\`\`python import torch.optim as optim # 其他层的默认学习率 default_lr = 0.001 # 想要降低学习率的那一层的学习率 slower_lr = 0.0001 # 分离出想要降低学习率的层的参数 slower_params = list(map(id, model.layer_to_slow.parameters())) base_params = filter(lambda p: id(p) not in slower_params, model.parameters()) # 配置优化器，设置不同的学习率 optimizer = optim.Adam([ {'params': base_params}, # 默认学习率 {'params': model.layer_to_slow.parameters(), 'lr': slower_lr} ], lr=default_lr) \`\`\` 这段代码中： -

Существует несколько типов облачных сервисов, основными из которых являются: 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** – Инфраструктура как сервис. Предоставляет пользователям вычислительные ресурсы в виде виртуальных машин, хранилищ данных, сетей и т. д. 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** – Платформа как сервис. Предоставляет набор инструментов и сервисов, которые разработчики могут использовать для создания и управления приложениями: базы данных, средства разработки, системы управления версиями и т. д. 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** – Программное обеспечение как сервис. Позволяет пользователям подключаться к и использовать облачное приложение через интернет, например, электронную почту, CRM-системы, офисные приложения. Преимущества облачных сервисов включают в себя: - **Масштабируемость:** в зависимости от нужд, пользователи могут увеличивать или уменьшать ресурсы. - **Эластичность:** ресурсы могут быть быстро предоставлены или освобождены. - **Оптимизация затрат:** платежи осуществляются только за фактически использованные ресурсы. Это помогает избежать затрат на покупку и обслуживание собственного оборудования. - **Доступность:** сервисы доступны с любого устройства, подключенного к интернету, что обеспечивает удобство доступа с разных устройств и из разных мест. Облачные сервисы пользуются популярностью среди различных организаций и индивидуалов, поскольку они предлагают гибкое и масштабируемое решение для хранения данных, вычислений и разработки приложений."},{"instruction":"что такое облачный сервер","output":"Облачный сервер – это виртуальный сервер, который работает в облачной вычислительной среде. Он предоставляет те же функции, что и физический сервер, но доступен через интернет. Облачные серверы создаются, размещаются и предлагаются через облачную вычислительную платформу и могут предоставлять широкий спектр вычислительных ресурсов и услуг. Ключевыми характеристиками облачных серверов являются: 1. **Виртуализация:** Облачные сервера являются виртуальными, а не физическими. Это значит, что они работают на виртуальных машинах, предоставленных облачным провайдером. 2. **Масштабируемость:** Пользователи могут легко увеличивать или уменьшать вычислительные ресурсы в зависимости от своих потребностей, таких как процессорное время, объем памяти и пространство для хранения данных. 3. **Эластичность:** Автоматическое масштабирование ресурсов в реальном времени, чтобы соответствовать изменяющимся требованиям к загрузке. 4. **Доступность и надежность:** Облачные сервера могут реплицироваться в разных географических зонах и дата-центрах, что обеспечивает высокий уровень доступности и устойчивость к сбоям. 5. **Стоимость:** Платежи обычно основаны на модели \\"оплата по факту использования\\", что позволяет пользователям платить только за ресурсы и услуги, которыми они фактически пользовались. Использование облачных серверов позволяет предприятиям и индивидуальным пользователям избавиться от необходимости инвестировать в дорогостоящее оборудование и его обслуживание, облегчает управление инфраструктурой и повышает гибкость и масштабируемость их ИТ-ресурсов."},{"instruction":"но у облачного сервера все рано где то должна быть физическая оболочка","output":"Да, вы абсолютно правы. Каждый облачный сервер, несмотря на свою виртуальность, в конечном итоге работает на физическом оборудовании. Облачные серверы являются виртуализированными инстансами, работающими внутри физических серверов, расположенных в данных-центрах облачных провайдеров. Как это работает: 1. **Физические серверы и оборудование:** Где-то в данных-центрах по всему миру расположены физические серверы. Эти серверы оснащены процессорами, оперативной памятью, жесткими дисками и другими компонентами, необходимыми для выполнения вычислений. 2. **Гипервизор:** На физических серверах установлен программный слой, известный как гипервизор. Гипервизор позволяет создавать, управлять и запускать виртуализированные (или виртуальные) серверы на одном физическом оборудовании. Он отвечает за разделение ресурсов физического сервера на виртуальные и предоставление этих виртуализированных ресурсов облачным серверам. 3. **Виртуализация:** Благодаря технологии виртуализации, множество виртуальных серверов может распределяться по одному или нескольким физическим серверам, каждый из которых действует как отдельный, изолированный сервер со своими операционными системами и приложениями. Таким образом, когда вы используете облачный сервер, вы фактически арендуете часть вычислительной мощности, которая физически находится в данный-центре облачного провайдера. Это обеспечивает гибкость и масштабируемость, поскольку вы можете быстро увеличивать или уменьшать ресурсы вашего виртуального сервера, не беспокоясь о физическом оборудовании."},{"instruction":"когда они появились","output":"Концепция облачных вычислений начала формироваться ещё в 1960-х годах, когда Джон Маккарти предположил, что вычислительная техника может когда-то быть организована в виде общественной инфраструктуры, аналогичной водоснабжению или электросети. Однако реализация этих идей в жизнь стала возможной только с развитием интернета и технологий виртуализации. # Развитие облачных вычислений: - **1960-е - 1970-е годы**: Концепция виртуализации, позволяющая разделить физический сервер на несколько логических или виртуальных серверов, стала краеугольным камнем для развития будущих облачных технологий. - **1990-е годы**: Популярность интернета растёт, и появляются первые коммерческие предложения виртуального хостинга, являвшиеся предшественниками облачных технологий. - **2006 год**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) запускает Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), предлагая виртуальные серверы как коммерческую услугу. Это событие часто рассматривают как начало эры современных облачных вычислений. С тех пор облачные вычисления продолжают развиваться, и многие крупные IT-компании, включая Google, Microsoft, IBM и другие, предложили свои облачные платформы и сервисы. Облачные технологии охватывают широкий спектр услуг, от инфраструктуры как сервиса (IaaS) и платформы как сервиса (PaaS) до программного обеспечения как сервиса (SaaS). # Значение облачных технологий: Облачные вычисления изменили подходы к ИТ-инфраструктуре и разработке программного обеспечения, предложив масштабируемость, гибкость и экономию средств компаниям различных размеров и отраслей. Сегодня они являются неотъемлемой частью цифровой экономики, поддерживая всё, от малых стартапов до глобальных корпораций и государственных организаций."},{"instruction":"как посмотреть в убунту какие есть права у пользователя","output":"В системе Ubuntu, как и в большинстве дистрибутивов Linux, для проверки прав (или привилегий) у конкретного пользователя можно использовать несколько подходов, как в терминале, так и через графический интерфейс. Однако наиболее распространённым и удобным методом является использование команд в терминале. 1. **Проверка групп, к которым принадлежит пользователь** Большинство прав в системах Linux находится под контролем системы разграничения доступа на основе групп. Чтобы проверить, к каким группам принадлежит текущий пользователь, можно использовать следующую команду: \`\`\`bash groups \`\`\` Чтобы посмотреть группы для конкретного пользователя, используйте: \`\`\`bash groups имя_пользователя \`\`\` 2. **Проверка прав через файл \`/etc/group\`** Этот файл содержит информацию о всех группах. Вы можете просмотреть его содержимое, чтобы узнать состав групп: \`\`\`bash cat /etc/group | grep имя_пользователя \`\`\` 3. **Использование команды \`id\`** Команда \`id\` предоставляет информацию о пользователе, включая его UID (идентификатор пользователя), GID (идентификатор основной группы) и принадлежность к дополнительным группам. Просто введите: \`\`\`bash id имя_пользователя \`\`\` Если имя пользователя не указано, команда вернёт информацию о текущем пользователе. 4. **Проверка наличия sudo прав** Пользователи с правами \`sudo\` могут выполнять команды от имени пользователя root, что предоставляет им практически неограниченные возможности в системе. Чтобы проверить, имеет ли текущий пользователь привилегии \`sudo\`, можно попробовать выполнить команду с \`sudo\` и увидеть, запрашивается ли пароль: \`\`\`bash sudo -l \`\`\` Эта команда покажет, какие именно команды может выполнять пользователь, используя \`sudo\`. Обратите внимание, что для проверки прав пользователя необходимо иметь доступ к терминалу и, в некоторых случаях, права администратора для просмотра или изменения конфигураций системы."},{"instruction":"sudo есть только у root?","output":"На самом деле, концепция привилегий \`sudo\` в Linux и системах, подобных Unix, немного отличается от того, как вы описали. Команда \`sudo\` позволяет пользователям, которые не являются пользователем \`root\`, выполнять команды с правами суперпользователя (т. е., \`root\`) или других пользователей, если это разрешено в конфигурационном файле \`sudo\`, который обычно находится в \`/etc/sudoers\`. Вот несколько ключевых моментов, чтобы лучше понять работу \`sudo\`: 1. **Не только \`root\`**: - По умолчанию \`root\` может делать в системе всё без необходимости использования \`sudo\`, так как \`root\` уже и так имеет все привилегии. - Пользователи, отличные от \`root\`, могут использовать \`sudo\` для выполнения команд с привилегиями \`root\`, но только если они включены в список \`sudoers\`. 2. **Файл \`/etc/sudoers\`**: - Этот файл содержит настройки, определяющие, какие пользователи или группы могут выполнять команды с использованием \`sudo\` и какие именно команды они могут выполнять. - Рекомендуется редактировать этот файл с помощью команды \`visudo\`, которая предотвращает сохранение синтаксически некорректных изменений. 3. **Пример добавления пользователя в \`sudoers\`**: - Допустим, вы хотите разрешить пользователю \`alex\` выполнять любые команды с использованием \`sudo\`. Вы бы добавили следующую строку в файл \`/etc/sudoers\` (через \`visudo\`): \`\`\` alex ALL=(ALL) ALL \`\`\` Это означает, что пользователь \`alex\` может выполнять от имени любого пользователя (\`ALL=(ALL)\`) любые команды (\`ALL\`) на всех машинах (первое \`ALL\`). Стоит отметить, что использование \`sudo\` увеличивает безопасность системы, поскольку позволяет избежать постоянной работы от имени пользователя \`root\`, что может быть потенциально опасно. Кроме того, \`sudo\` фиксирует в логах все выполненные команды, что упрощает отслеживание изменений, произведённых в системе."},{"instruction":"как создавать группы и создавать пользователей","output":"В Linux и системах Unix-like для создания групп и пользователей используются команды из терминала. Вот базовые инструкции по созданию пользователей и групп: # Создать группу Для создания новой группы используется команда \`groupadd\`. Вам нужно быть суперпользователем или использовать \`sudo\` для выполнения этой команды. Пример: \`\`\`sh sudo groupadd имя_группы \`\`\` Замените \`имя_группы\` на желаемое имя новой группы. # Создать пользователя Для создания нового пользователя служит команда \`useradd\` (или \`adduser\` в некоторых дистрибутивах, таких как Debian и Ubuntu, где \`adduser\` является более дружественным скриптом над \`useradd\`). Пример использования \`useradd\`: \`\`\`sh sudo useradd -m -g имя_группы -s /bin/bash имя_пользователя \`\`\` - \`-m\` означает создание домашнего каталога для пользователя. - \`-g\` указывает основную группу для пользователя. Если группа не указана, будет создана новая группа с именем пользователя. - \`-s\` определяет оболочку по умолчанию для пользователя. \`/bin/bash\` — наиболее распространённый выбор. **Пример использования \`adduser\` в Debian/Ubuntu:** \`\`\`sh sudo adduser имя_пользователя \`\`\` Этот метод более интерактивен и запросит дополнительную информацию, такую как полное имя пользователя, пароль и другие данные. По умолчанию, \`adduser\` также создаст домашний каталог для нового пользователя и задаст ему оболочку \`/bin/bash\`. # Добавить пользователя в группу После создания пользователя, вы можете добавить его в дополнительные группы с помощью команды \`usermod\`: \`\`\`sh sudo usermod -aG имя_группы имя_пользователя \`\`\` - \`-aG\` указывает на добавление пользователя в дополнительные группы. Замените \`имя_группы\` на группу, к которой вы хотите добавить пользователя, а \`имя_пользователя\` — на название пользователя. **Пример:** \`\`\`sh sudo usermod -aG sudo имя_пользователя \`\`\` Эта команда добавит пользователя в группу \`sudo\`, предоставляя ему возможность выполнять команды с повышенными привилегиями. Помните, что после изменения групп пользователям обычно необходимо выйти из системы и войти снова, чтобы изменения вступили в силу."},{"instruction":"Write a movie about a man who refuses to dance, The Movie's name is \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\" and the film's trailer has the song of the same name","output":"[The screen starts black.

[The screen splits showing various quick clips - a bustling dance class, a lively wedding party, and a flash mob in the park - all while the song's tempo picks up.] Narrator: Jackson Hughes - an art gallery owner with a secret that keeps his feet firmly on the ground. [A series of flashbacks, slightly muted in color, reveal a younger Jackson, vibrant and full of life, dancing passionately on a stage but ending with an accident that visibly shakes him.] Friend: (Concerned) You've been off the dance floor for what, 10 years now? It's time, Jack. [Cut back to Jackson scoffingly shaking his head as he walks past a lively dance studio. He pauses to look through the window, a mix of longing and fear in his eyes.] Narrator: Until one day... [A quick montage shows vibrant and quirky dance instructor AMELIA RIVERA (30s, vivacious, full of life) literally bumping into him, her energy almost palpable.] Amelia: (Laughing as she helps him up) You know, the universe has a funny way of throwing us off balance just to see if we’ll dance through the chaos. [Scenes flash by showing Jackson reluctantly agreeing to attend one of Amelia's beginner dance classes, struggling with basic steps, and accidentally having fun.] Narrator: As he steps out of his comfort zone... [The music volume increases, the beat catches up. The montage becomes faster: laughing during dance lessons, a late-night practice in an empty studio, slowly getting the hang of it.] Narrator: ...he'll find rhythm in the most unexpected places. [A brief, tender moment shows Jackson and Amelia practicing a dance move that ends with them in a close embrace, looking surprised at their proximity.] Narrator: And maybe, just maybe... [The scenes speed towards a climax: a big dance event is announced; Jackson designing an art exhibit inspired by dance; him looking determined.] Narrator: ...he'll learn that to truly live... [Cut to a final dance performance. The music reaches its crescendo. We see quick flashes - feet moving in perfect synchrony, hands clasped tightly, a crowd cheering, and Jackson's face, alight with joy.] Narrator: ...one must find the courage to move. [The music fades with a gentle piano chord as the screen goes black.] Narrator: I Don’t Feel Like Dancing. Sometimes, stepping out of the rhythm can lead you to the most beautiful dance of your life. [Text on screen: COMING SOON] [The subtle strains of \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\" linger as the title and release date appear on screen, followed by the film's logo.] Narrator: Dance into theaters this holiday season."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Важно заметить, что как талая, так и водопроводная вода могут иметь различия в своём составе в зависимости от местных условий, источника воды, способов её очистки и прочего. Однако существуют общие показатели, по которым можно попытаться провести различие: 1. **Химический состав**: - **Соли минералов**: Водопроводная вода чаще имеет более высокое содержание минералов (в том числе кальция и магния), так как она обычно проходит через почву и породы, растворяя их компоненты. Талая вода, особенно полученная из чистого снега или ледников, может иметь меньшее количество растворённых минералов. - **Органические вещества и микробиологический состав**: Водопроводная вода обычно подвергается очистке и дезинфекции, что значительно снижает количество органических веществ и микробов. Талая вода, в зависимости от источника, может содержать различное количество органических веществ и микробов. 2. **Физические показатели**: - **Температура**: Температура талой воды, как правило, будет ниже, чем у водопроводной, особенно если она получена непосредственно из таяния льда или снега. - **Прозрачность**: Талая вода может быть более прозрачной в сравнении с водопроводной, особенно если последняя содержит растворенные вещества и частицы, добавленные в процессе очистки или полученные в трубопроводах. 3. **Электропроводность и pH**: - Электропроводность талой воды обычно ниже из-за меньшего содержания растворенных ионов. Водопроводная вода зачастую содержит ионы, делая её более проводящей. - pH талой и водопроводной воды может значительно отличаться в зависимости от исходного источника воды и процессов очистки. Талая вода часто имеет нейтральный или слегка щелочной pH, в то время как водопроводная вода может корректироваться в процессе подготовки для употребления с целью предотвращения коррозии труб. Для точного определения отличий между талой и водопроводной водой необходимо проведение лабораторных анализов, включающих оценку минерального состава, уровня загрязнений, присутствия микроорганизмов и других параметров.

Oder ob sie sich in dem Maße mit den „klassischen\\" Mitteln einer staatlichen Verwaltung ökonomischer Schwierigkeiten nicht mehr bewältigen läßt, in dem in den sozusagen normalen Ablauf kapitalistischer Zyklen ein Bruchfaktor nicht mehr rein ökonomischer Art eingebrochen ist und die Gesetzmäßigkeit der Kapitalbewegung von innen her über den Haufen geworfen hat. Daß die Wiederherstellung, vielmehr die erneute Erkennbarkeit des Konkurrenzverhältnisses auf dem Weltmarkt dabei eine entscheidende Rolle gespielt hat, hängt mit dem Totalitätscharakter der Produktionsweise zusammen: Die Unfähigkeit und die Widersprüchlichkeit des Kapitalismus wurden wieder ins Bewußtsein gehoben. Dennoch liegt die entscheidende Ursache nicht im Konkurrenzverhältnis. Maurice Dobb konnte neulich feststellen, daß selbst einer äußerlich gesehen rein wirtschaftlich¬monetären Erscheinung wie der Währungskrise und der Weltinflation in Wirklichkeit tiefer greifende Klassenkonflikte zugrunde liegen. (Diskussion in der Unita, 23., 28., 30. April und 4. Mai 1974.) In der Tat ist der „soziale Friede” in seinen vielfältigen Formen der Manipulation, der Integration, des sozialen Betrugs und der sozialen Errungenschaften inzwischen weltweit aufgekündigt worden. Wenn auch in verschiedener Stärke, je nach der besonderen geschichtlichen Lage der einzelnen kapitalistischen Nationalgesellschaften, meldet sich immer mehr die „Negation von Fabrik und Staat” an, überspringt günstige konjunkturelle Aufschwünge, verschärft die ökonomische Krise dort, wo diese aus der Kapitalbewegung entsteht - oder führt sie herbei, wenn sie sich zyklisch noch nicht einstellt. In einer solchen Situation nutzen alle Interventionsmöglichkeiten und Stabilitätsmaßnahmen des Staats nicht mehr viel, die Kapitalreproduktion noch zu retten. Die Negation zielt im Grunde weder auf Demokratisierung politischer Zustände und Institutionen noch auf eine „Humanisierung” der Mehrwertproduktion, noch - trotz Sorge um den Arbeitsplatz - auf die Wiederankurbelung der Ausbeutung. Als unlösliche Einheit von Befreiung und Befriedigung der Massenbedürfnisse setzt sie sich andere Ziele, die selbst dort revolutionär sind, wo das volle Bewußtsein ihres umwälzenden Charakters noch fehlt und sie in biederer Art als Umweltschutz¬Aktion (ein Beispiel für viele) ausgegeben wird. Analysiert man diese Ziele genau, hinter den zuweilen zweifellos unsicheren, rohen oder schillernden Erscheinungsformen, die sie annehmen - und die auch zu scheinbar irrationalen, bürgerlicher Betulichkeit nicht ganz geheuren Ausbrüchen zweideutiger Art führen können21 - so konkretisieren sie sich auf zwei Ebenen, auf denen die wesentlichen Prozesse der gesellschaftlichen Existenz stattfinden. Einmal vollzieht sich in der Sphäre der unmittelbaren Produktion, innerhalb der stofflichen Seite des Verhältnisses Kapital-Arbeit in zunehmend starkem Maß, auch wenn die Intensität von Land zu Land variiert, eine der Kapitalverwertung zuwiderlaufende Bewegung. Die „Arbeiterrebellion”, gesteigert zuweilen bis zur schlichten Arbeitsverweigerung selbst in Rezessionszeiten,22 zielt ohne die traditionelle politische Vermittlung, d. h. ohne repräsentative Organisationen dazwischen zu schalten darauf, die gewalttätig-degradierende Funktionalität des Verwertungsprozesses zu treffen, sie durch eine andere Form der Arbeit: durch freie, schöpferische Tätigkeit abzulösen. Der Aufstand des Arbeitsprozesses gegen den Verwertungsprozeß in der Produktion mag auch zur Humanisierung der Arbeit beitragen. In Wirklichkeit trifft er den Kern der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise und will sie nicht verbessern, sondern zerstören. Zerstörerisch - und daher zwingend unter Kontrolle zu bringen - sind die im Laufe der langjährigen Rebellion entwik- kelten Kampfformen. Sie konkretisieren sich vor allem in einer strategischen Linie der permanenten, autonomen Arbeitsunterbrechung und Arbeitsinsubordination, die - wie das italienische Beispiel zeigt - heute für die „normale”, das ist entlang ökonomischer Gesetzmäßigkeit verlaufende Reproduktion großer Kapitale (der Monopole) weitaus gefährlicher sind, als die rein politisch vermittelte Präsenz der Arbeiterklasse in den Instituten des bürgerlichen Staats. Zweitens: auf der Ebene gesamtgesellschaftlicher Prozesse setzt sich die Absage an die Verwertung fort in der umfassenderen Tendenz, nicht nur die Mehrwertproduktion in Frage zu stellen, sondern auch das ihr zugrundeliegende Produktionszzie/: die Schaffung von Tauschwerten. Die radikale Umwälzung des Produktionsziels vom Tauschwert zum Gebrauchswert, oder, wenn man so will: der Aufstand des Gebrauchswerts gegen den Tauschwert, hat bisher noch nicht die reifen Formen und den Grad der Bewußtheit erlangt, der sich bei der unmittelbaren Konfrontation zwischen Arbeit und Verwertung feststellen läßt. Es tut sich aber genug, um Kapital und Staat zu alarmieren. Wenn auch auf der untersten, spontanen Stufe der Bewußtseinsbildung, gehören viele konfliktuale Erscheinungen im Reproduktionsbereich: Häuserbesetzungen, Besetzung von Warenhäusern und Supermärkten, Forderungen nach Kinderstätten, Schulen, also nach den sozialen Diensten jenseits der Warenqualität, von Null-Punkt-Aktionen bis auf die - auf einer schon hohen Stufe der Bewußtheit - von den „Konsumenten” vorgenommenen Festsetzung der Waren und Güterpreise23 in den gleichen Negationszusammenhang, in dem in der Fabrik die ökonomische Zerstörung der Produktionsweise vorangetrieben wird. In diesem Zusammenhang verschwindet denn auch die nur theoretisch postulierte - in der abstrakten Analyse zuweilen sinnvolle, in der Praxis relativ belanglose - Scheidung von Produktionsbereich, in dem Mehrwert geschaffen wird und Reproduktionsbereich, wo Tauschwerte sich in Profite umsetzen. Fraglos lassen sich empirisch-soziologisch, innerhalb dieser einheitlichen Klassenfront, Differenzierungen, Spaltungen und immanente Konfliktsituationen ausfindig machen. Es kommen dabei Kriterien der Sozialforschung zur Geltung, die immer gegen den „Begriff” der Arbeiterklasse und den „Begriff” der Massen ins Feld geführt werden und die eindeutige Funktion haben, angesichts sozialer und politischer Krisen das fein strukturierte Gemüt der Bourgeoisie zu beruhigen. In der Tat: Mag der Klassenkampf noch so „toben”, mag die Produktion stok-ken und Bastionen des Imperialismus fallen: „wissenschaftlich” gesehen handelt es sich um geschichtliche Zufälle. Nun bieten solche Kriterien auch analytische Mittel zur genaueren Fassung der Klassenwirklichkeit vom Standpunkt der Arbeit (und nicht des Kapitals) aus und sind keineswegs lückenlos parteilich schon besetzt. Die Wirklichkeit als Totalität treffen sie jedoch nicht.24 Die Absage an die kapitalistische Produktionsweise, die in den letzten Jahren sich ausgebreitet hat, kennt keine Qualifi-kations- oder Einkommensschranken mehr.25 Angesichts dieser Situation, die zugleich Enthüllung des Wesens des Kapitalismus bedeutet und zur praktischen Kritik der politischen Ökonomie vom proletarischen Standpunkt aus führt, kommt das Kapital mit den gewöhnlichen Mitteln seines Staats nicht mehr aus. Die Notwendigkeit einer neuen institutionellen Strategie, die die Planung oder vielmehr die Planbarmachung solcher Vorgänge ermöglichen soll, gründet sich allerdings nicht machtpolitisch, sondern strikt ökonomisch. Sie wird durch die Transformation bedingt, die die kapitalistische Produktionsweise immanent erfahren hat und die das Kapital unter einen durch die wieder mit voller Geltung aufgetretene Weltmarktkonkurrenz unausweichlich gewordenen Planungszwang gestellt hat - wobei es praktisch völlig belanglos ist, ob sich die Planung der einzelen Kapitale erfolgreich durchsetzen kann. Im wesentlichen handelt es sich um zwei Grundbedingungen, die die Planung erzwingen und die genau den zwei Rebellionsmomenten zuwiderlaufen. Die zunehmende Konzentration und Zentralisation der Kapitale (bis hin zur Erscheinungsform der Monopolbildung) erfordert dringend eine stärkere Durchsetzbarkeit der Tauschwertorientierung gegen die Befriedigung von Massenbedürfnissen. Das Kapital, namentlich das Großkapital kann sich heute weniger denn je leisten, sich dem Druck von „Massenwünschen” zu beugen und seine Selbstverwertung sozialen Diensten, Aufgaben und Ausgaben zu opfern.”翻译为中文","output":"问题仅仅在于，经济衰退是否仅仅停留在经济层面，是否完全可以归因于已经理论上充分解释的周期性原因。或者，它是否已经到了用国家管理经济困难的“经典”手段无法处理的程度，因为在所谓的资本主义周期的正常过程中，一种非纯经济性的断裂因素已经介入，从内部颠覆了资本运动的规律性。世界市场上竞争关系的重建、更确切地说是竞争关系的再次可识别性在此中起到了决定性作用，这与生产方式的整体性质相联系：资本主义的无能和矛盾再次被提升到意识中。然而，决定性原因并不在于竞争关系。Maurice Dobb最近指出，即使是表面看来纯粹是经济-货币现象的货币危机和世界通货膨胀，实际上根源于更深层的阶级冲突。（在《Unita》上的讨论，1974年4月23日、28日、30日和5月4日。） 实际上，各种形式的“社会和平”已经在全球范围内被终止。尽管其强度各不相同，取决于各个资本主义国家不同的历史状况，但“工厂和国家的否定”越发频繁地发生，越过有利的经济上升期，加剧了那些源于资本运动的经济危机 - 或者在周期性尚未出现时引发危机。在这样的情况下，国家的所有干预可能性和稳定措施都无济于事，无法再拯救资本再生产。这种否定根本上既不针对政治状况和机构的民主化，也不针对剩余价值生产的“人性化”，尽管关心工作岗位 - 也不是为了重新激活剥削。作为解放和满足大众需求的不可分割的整体，它设定了其他目标，这些目标本身就是革命性的，即使是在其颠覆性特征的完全意识尚未出现、并且它以温和的环保行动（只是众多例子中的一个）的方式被提出时。 如果我们仔细分析这些目标，在它们有时无疑不确定、粗糙或光彩夺目的表现形式之后 - 这也可能导致看起来不合逻辑的、让资产阶级觉得不安的模糊爆发 - 它们在两个层面上具体化，这些层面上发生着社会存在的主要过程。 一方面，在直接生产领域，即在资本-劳动关系的物质方面，尤其是当强度从国家到国家有所变化时，发生了与资本增值相对立的运动，有时甚至在衰退期间达到了简单的拒绝工作的程度，这种“工人叛乱”不依赖于传统的政治中介，即不插入代表性的组织来直接打击剥削过程中的暴力-贬低功能，试图通过其他形式的工作：自由的、创造性的活动来取代它。生产过程对增值过程的反抗可能也有助于工作的人性化。实际上，它打击了资本主义生产方式的核心，并且不是要改善它，而是要摧毁它。在多年叛乱过程中发展出来的斗争形式是具有破坏性的 - 因此必须被严格控制 - 它们主要具体化为一条战略路线，即不断的、自主的工作中断和不服从，这如意大利的例子所示，对于“正常”的，即沿着经济规律运行的资本大额再生产（垄断）来说，远比工人阶级在资产阶级国家机构中的政治介入要危险得多。 其次，在整个社会过程的层面上，反对增值的态度在更广泛的倾向中得以继续，这不仅仅是质疑剩余价值生产，而且也质疑其基础的生产目标：创造交换价值。从交换价值到使用价值的生产目标的根本变革，或者说：使用价值对交换价值的起义，尚未达到在直接劳动与增值对抗中发现的那种成熟形式和意识程度。但已经足够让资本和国家警觉。即使是在意识形态最低、最自发的阶段，许多在再生产领域的冲突性现象：占领房屋、占领商场和超市、对儿童中心、学校的需求，即对商品质量之外的社会服务的需求，从零开始的行动到由“消费者”进行的商品和服务价格的设定在相同的否定背景中，都在工厂中推进生产方式的经济破坏。在这个背景下，也消失了生产领域（在那里产生剩余价值）和再生产领域（交换价值转化为利润）之间的，仅在理论上提出的 - 在抽象分析中有时有用的，在实践中相对无关紧要的 - 区分。 毋庸置疑，在这一统一的阶级阵线内部，可以发现分化、分裂和内在的冲突情况。在这里，社会研究的标准发挥作用，这些标准总是用来反对“工人阶级的概念”和“大众的概念”，并且具有明确的功能，在面对社会和政治危机时安抚资产阶级的细腻心灵。实际上：无论阶级斗争如何“激烈”，无论生产如何停滞，无论帝国主义的堡垒如何倒塌：“科学地”看，这都被视为历史的偶然。然而，这些标准也提供了从劳动（而非资本）的立场出发更准确把握阶级实际的分析工具，而不是完全有偏见地被占据。然而，它们没有触及现实的整体性。过去几年中，对资本主义生产方式的拒绝不再有任何资格或收入限制。 在这种既揭示了资本主义本质又导致从无产阶级立场对政治经济学进行实践批判的情况下，资本无法再依靠其国家的常规手段。新的制度策略的必要性，即使不是基于权力政治，也是基于严格的经济考量。它由资本主义生产方式内在经历的转变决定，这种转变将资本置于由重新获得全面影响力的世界市场竞争不可避免地导致的计划压力之下 - 而实际上，计划是否能成功地对单个资本进行实施完全无关紧要。基本上，它涉及到两个强制性的基本条件，这些条件与两个叛逆时刻直接相反。资本的增加集中和中央化（直至垄断形式的出现）迫切需要更强烈地实施交换价值取向，而非屈服于“大众愿望”的压力，牺牲其自我增值以满足社会服务、任务和支出。"},{"instruction":"请将“Noch stärker, weil beide Momente treffend, wirkt sich jene immanente Veränderung aus, die sich in der Erhöhung der organischen Zusammensetzung des Kapitals konkretisiert und nicht nur äußerlich den Absatz unnötiger Waren betrifft, sondern innerlich in die unmittelbare Produktion von Mehrwert einerseits, in die Entwicklung der Profitrate andererseits einschneidet. In diesem geschichtlichen Entwicklungsstadium des Kapitalismus wirkt sich die Rebellion nicht mehr nur störend aus und läßt sich daher naturwüchsig nicht mehr auffangen: durch die gewöhnlichen Mittel des liberaldemokratischen Staats. Sie bricht zerstörend in die Kapitalreproduktion ein, weil sie sowohl die Produktionsplanung für den Markt als auch deren Voraussetzung: die Kontinuität der Produktion und die Kontrolle über den kontinuierlichen Ablauf des Verwertungsprozesses über den Haufen wirft. Sie wirkt tödlich: „Auf je größrer Stufenleiter sich ... das capital fixe entwickelt ..., um so mehr wird die Kontinuität des Produktionsprozesses oder der beständige Fluß der Reproduktion äußerlich zwingende Bedingungen der auf das Kapital begründeten Produktionsweise”. (Marx, Grundrisse 591) Die Forderung des Kapitals, eines Kapitals, das sich - wie oben dargestellt - nur um das Tauschverhältnis und um die Profitrealisierung kümmern kann, an den Staat bestimmt sich in der Perspektive der ihm drohenden Gefahr, der „planend”, das ist durch die Bereitstellung und Ausnutzung entsprechender Instrumente (vom Verfassungsorgan bis zu technologischen Subsystemen), entgegengewirkt werden soll. Es geht um den Versuch einer Neutralisierung und optimalen Eliminierung der Negation in den vielfältigen Bereichen, in denen sich Massenbedürfnisse politisch (das heißt: in der Machtfrage) artikulieren können und in dem spezifischen Bereich, in dem die Kontinuität des Produktionsflusses durch Arbeitsverweigerung und Insubordination einerseits unterbrochen wird; andererseits institutionell nicht geregelte Formen der Unterbrechung politisch die Kontrollierbarkeit und Planbarkeit einer Unterbrechung unmöglich machen. In der Umkehrung ergibt sich der gesellschaftliche Inhalt der staatlichen Planung: durch verstaatlichte Formen der politischen Artikulation die Rebellion in die Konstitutionalität, und das ist genau in die Akkumulationsfunktionalität zurückzuzwingen; durch rechtlich geregelte, der Planbarkeit zugängliche Formen der Austragung von Arbeitskonflikten den „beständigen Fluß der Reproduktion” zu sichern. Es ist nur ein greifbares Kennzeichen dieser, Ökonomie und Politik verschmelzenden Planversuche, daß sie zwar auch den Markt betreffen, aber den Markt nicht als Umlaufverhältnis konkurrierender Kapitale, sondern den Arbeitsmarkt als Umschlagstelle des Tauschverhältnisses von Arbeit und Kapital. Immer mehr muß also die Staatspolitik auf die Garantie des Produktionsflusses, auf die Kontrolle und Planbarkeit der Arbeitsunterbrechung und auf die Einkapselung der gebrauchswertorientierten Massenbedürfnisse zielen. Die Instrumente sind vielfältig (auch die Konservation des Bestehenden kann Phantasie entwickeln); die von den einzelnen Nationalgesellschaften gebotenen Beispiele der akkumulationsadäquaten Gesellschaftsplanung müßten einzeln analysiert werden - erstens für die Ausarbeitung einer emanzipationsadäquaten Praxis; zweitens für die genauere Bestimmung möglicher Widersprüche, deren Ausnutzung die Strategie des Kapitals schwächen könnte. Freilich gibt es auch scheinbare Widersprüche: nur in der Simulation, also rein spielerisch vorstellbare Möglichkeiten der Umkehrung (der „Umfunktionierung”) bürgerlicher Errungenschaften, die in Wirklichkeit einen klug durchdachten und erdachten Bestandteil der Neutralisierungspolitik bilden. Das klassisch zu nennende Beispiel bietet die Beteiligung von Arbeitervertretern an der „Bestimmung” über marginale Bedingungen der Produktion. Gerade die legalisierten und dadurch der Rechtskontrolle unterworfenen Formen der Mitbestimmung gehören zu den wirksamsten Mitteln der Planbarkeit, der kontrollierbaren Austragung von Konflikten im Produktionsbereich. Der Widerstand der Unternehmer gegen die Mitbestimmung in Westdeutschland offenbart ohnehin nur die taktische Klugheit des Kapitals. In Italien schielt der Industriellenverband (Confindustria) nach der westdeutschen Regelung. Gesellschaftsplanung kann sich vordergründig und im ideologischen Angebot (zum Beispiel in Wahlzeiten) als technischtechnologisch konzipierte Verbesserung der Lage der abhängigen Massen und als listiges Instrument des Fortschritts anbieten. Der „Planstaat” erscheint hier als Diener des Volks, seine Integrationspolitik als Fortschritt zur Humanisierung der Gesellschaft. Die parteipolitischen Unterschiede im Angebot erweisen sich als nur machtpolitisch wichtig, für den wirklichen Zustand der Massen (der „Konsumenten”masse und der Klasse der unmittelbaren Produzenten) als wesentlich belanglos, wenn auch marginal interessant. Gegen die Hebung der Qualität des Lebens läßt sich nichts einwenden - wenn nur die Ursachen verschwinden, die die Qualität des Lebens zerstören. Die Vertreter des Kapitals und seines Staats sprechen eine weniger mystifizierte, dafür erfreulicherweise sinnvollere Sprache. Angesichts der ökonomischen Krise zeigen sie genau an, wo in Wirklichkeit das kritische Problem liegt: „Das heutige Problem ist nicht die Hebung der Lebensqualität in der Fabrik, sondern die Kontinuität des Lebens der Fabrik”26 - eben die Kontinuität des Flusses der Reproduktion. Damit meldet sich die Koppelung von Gesellschaftsplan und Krise an. Der doppelte, auf der gesellschaftlichen Ebene und in der unmittelbaren Produktion vorangetriebene Angriff gegen das Kapital und seinen Organisator macht erst die wirkliche Krise des Kapitalismus aus, die auch den regenerativen Charakter des Zyklus sprengt. Sie trifft nicht die bloße Verwertung, sie geht vielmehr weit über die ökonomisch auftretenden Verwertungsschwierigkeiten hinaus und sprengt den Kern der Produktionsweise: die durch Tauschwerte bestimmte Mehrwertproduktion und ihre gesicherte Weiterexistenz. Insofern kann man von einer Verschiebung der Krisenachse im heutigen Kapitalismus sprechen, deren Beachtung in den Mittel punkt langfristiger politisch-strategischer Überlegungen rücken muß. Gegenüber dieser konfliktualen Perspektive des Zusam menbruchs verlieren die bekannten, rein ökonomischen Über produktionserscheinungen nicht etwa an Bedeutung. Zyklen und Klassenkampf lassen sich nicht mechanisch trennen. Nur be deutet die Verschiebung, daß der Konkurrenzkampf der Kapi tale auf dem Weltmarkt nicht länger als Ursache einer endgülti gen Krisensituation zu sehen ist; und daß dem - entsprechend auf der Ebene planender Eingriffe des Staats nicht mehr der Versuch des ökonomischen Krisenmanagements und der Regulierung wirtschaftlicher Abläufe die wesentliche Verzahnung von politi scher Maßnahme und Kapitalerfordernis darstellt.”翻译为中文","output":"更重要的是，因为两个方面都非常贴切，资本有机构成提升所体现的那种内在变化影响重大，它不仅外在地涉及到不必要商品的销售，而且内在地深刻影响到直接生产剩余价值的一方面，以及对利润率的发展另一方面。在资本主义这一历史发展阶段，叛乱不再仅仅是一种干扰，因此不可能被自然地通过自由民主国家的常规手段所缓解：它以破坏性的方式闯入资本再生产中，因为它既打乱了市场的生产计划，也打乱了生产连续性和对增值过程持续流动的控制的前提条件。 它致命地影响：“固定资本......发展到越大规模，生产过程的连续性或再生产的持续流动就越成为资本为基础的生产方式的外在强制条件。”（马克思，《 Grundrisse》591）资本的需求，一个正如上所述只能关注交换关系和利润实现的资本，向国家提出的需求是基于其面临的威胁，也就是通过提供和利用相应工具（从宪法机构到技术子系统），来“有计划地”进行对抗。这涉及尝试在多个领域中中和和最优化消除否定，这些领域中群众需求可以在政治上（即在权力问题上）得到表述，特别是在生产流动的连续性被劳动拒绝和不服从所中断的特定领域；在另一方面，非制度化的中断形式在政治上使得控制和规划中断变得不可能。反过来，国家规划的社会内容：通过国有化形式的政治表达，将叛乱强行拉回宪法性，也就是精确地拉回积累功能；通过法律规定的、可以规划的劳动冲突解决形式，保证“再生产的持续流动”。一个明显的例证是，这些将经济和政治融合的规划尝试虽然也关注市场，但不是作为竞争资本的流通关系，而是将劳动市场作为劳动和资本的交换关系的转换点。 因此，国家政策越来越需要关注生产流的保障、劳动中断的控制和可规划性，以及将面向使用价值的群众需求封装起来。工具是多种多样的（即使保守现状也能发挥创意）；各个国家社会提供了适应积累的社会规划的例子，这需要逐一分析 - 第一，为了制定适合解放的实践；第二，为了更准确地确定可能的矛盾，其利用可能削弱资本的策略。当然，也存在表面上的矛盾：仅在模拟中，也就是纯粹以游戏形式想象的逆转（“功能转换”）的可能性，实际上构成了中和政策的精心设计和构思的组成部分。工人代表参与“决定”生产的边际条件提供了一个经典的例子。正是法律化并因此受到法律监管的共同决策形式，成为规划性、可控制地解决生产领域冲突的最有效手段。资本家对西德共同决策制度的抵制反映了资本的战术智慧。在意大利，工业家协会（Confindustria）对西德的规定表示羡慕。 社会规划可以表面上并在意识形态上（例如在选举期间）呈现为技术技术层面上改善从属大众状况的措施，以及作为进步的狡猾工具。这里，“计划国家”出现为人民的仆人，其整合政策作为社会人性化进步的表现。政党政治上的差异只在权力政治上重要，对于大众的真实状况（“消费者”群体和直接生产者阶级）基本无关紧要，即使在边缘上有点兴趣。对生活质量的提高没有异议 - 只要消除破坏生活质量的原因。资本及其国家的代表发表的语言更少神秘化，因此更加有意义。面对经济危机，他们准确指出了实际的关键问题在哪里：“如今的问题不是提高工厂中的生活质量，而是保证工厂的生命连续性”- 即再生产流动的连续性。 这标志着社会规划与危机的联系。针对资本及其组织者的双重攻击，在社会层面和直接生产中推进，构成了资本主义真正的危机，这破坏了周期的再生性特征。它不仅仅影响到再利用，而是远远超出了经济上出现的再利用困难，破坏了生产方式的核心：通过交换价值决定的剩余价值生产及其保证的持续存在。 因此，可以说在当今资本主义中危机轴心发生了转移，其关注点必须放在长远的政治战略考虑的中心。面对这种崩溃的冲突性前景，著名的纯经济过剩生产现象并没有变得不重要。周期和阶级斗争不能机械地分离。只是转移意味着，世界市场上资本的竞争斗争不再被视为最终危机情境的原因；并且相应地，在国家规划干预的层面上，不再是经济危机管理和经济活动调整的尝试构成了政治措施和资本要求之间的主要连结。"},{"instruction":"请将“Oben wurde schon die neue Seite des Staatseingriffs kurz erörtert. Die (alte) Frage der Staatsintervention in das Konkurrenzverhältnis (Krisenmanagement; versuchte Organisation der Kapitalverwertung; Maßnahmen, die sich letztlich gegen den tendenziellen Fall der Profitrate richten) und in den Verwertungsprozeß (Milderung der Disproportionalität und der Überproduktion durch staatliche Wirtschaftspolitik) wird für eine Funktionsanalyse des bürgerlichen Staats zwar nicht gegenstandslos, schon weil eine solche Krisenpolitik - zum Beispiel als Stabilitätspolitik ausgegeben - immer versucht wird. Sie rückt aber politisch in eine sekundäre Position. Die wirkliche Krise kann sich nach wie vor auchin der Zirkulation äußern, sie findet aber in produktionsspezifischen Konfliktsituationen statt. Die Kapitalreproduktion wird wesentlich (und das heißt: in der Perspektive eines tatsächlichen Zusammenbruchs) nicht durch akkumulationsimmanente Schwierigkeiten gefährdet, sondern im zunehmenden Maß durch Störung und Zerstörung der Mehrwert- und Tauschwertproduktion.27 Daher geht es -um es gedrängt zu sagen - bei den einzelnen Planmaßnahmen und Planungsformen des Staats um institutionelle Eingriffe, die Logik des Kapitals, die spezifische Rationalität der Mehrwertproduktion vor der Rebellion der Arbeit gegen die Verwertung und der Rebellion des Gebrauchswerts gegen den Tauschwert zu schützen. In dieser Lage verliert aber das Kapital seine Protagonistenrolle. Die Masse der Bevölkerung (die „Konsumenten”) und die unmittelbaren Produzenten werden zu Protagonisten: Das Klassenverhältnis bricht in die Kapitalbewegung ein und erweist sich als bestimmender Faktor. Die Nötigung, unter dem Zwang zur Produktionskontinuität die artikulierte Störung zu neutralisieren und auszuschalten, ergibt sich durchaus aus den immanenten Veränderungen der Produktionsweise. Denn sowohl das Wiederaufleben der offenen Klassenkämpfe in einigen kapitalistischen Ländern wie auch die höhere Bewußtheit der Massen entfalten sich nicht von irgendwoher, sondern genau entlang der hohen Stufe der Akkumulation.28 Wesentlich dabei ist aber, daß die Klasse - sonst unter das Kapitalverhältnis subsumiert als bloße Arbeitskraft -sich nunmehr autonom macht, sich von den Akkumulationsbedingungen freikämpft und sich förmlich, wenn auch nicht (immer) mit Feuerwaffen, auf das Kapital einschießt. Gesellschaftsplanung in dem dargestellten, besonderen Sinn ist also weder eine Ideologie der Technokraten (auch wenn technologisch sich gebende Führungsgruppen daraus ihre Ideologie machen) noch eine Wunschvorstellung kapitalkonformer Systemtheoretiker. Fraglos können hinter den einzelnen Plangesetzen und staatlichen Maßnahmen besondere, von der jeweiligen Lage der kapitalistischen Gesellschaften bedingte, mit jeweiligen Kapitalgruppen verbundene Bewegungen und Verbände innerhalb der politischen Kräfte stehen. Das macht auch Gewicht und Rolle der verschiedenen parteipolitischen Fronten aus, die zu formell je verschiedenen Perspektiventscheidungen kommen können. Im Einzelfall treten beim gesellschaftspolitischen Lenkungsversuch beachtliche Unterschiede auf: etwa in der Regulierung des Arbeitsmarktes, bei der gesetzlichen Normierung der Arbeitskämpfe (obzwar gerade hier der Spielraum einer differenzierten Regelung eingeschränkt ist), bei der Verteilung vorhandener finanzieller Mittel. Hier, vor allem im Planungsstadium, können technische „Führer” ihren Tummelplatz finden. Wichtig ist aber, den Zwang zur Planung und deren Charakter begrifflich genauer, konkreter zu fassen, um dadurch - unter anderem - der Versuchung zu entgehen, die technokratisch sich gebende Wende in der Politik dezisionistisch einzuschätzen. In der Tat gehört es zur Ideologie und zur Verschleierungstendenz des heutigen Kapitalismus, Planungselemente, Krisenmanagement und Systematisierung kollektiver Vorgänge als nicht mehr kapitalistisch auszugeben, sondern als (positive) Folgeerscheinung des Machtantritts klassenenthobener, an Verwertungsinteressen nicht mehr gebundener und vom Kapital daher nicht mehr gesteuerter oder steuerbarer Führungsgruppen. Die generelle Planungsaufgabe des staatlichen Organisators erwächst vielmehr organisch aus der notwendig gewordenen Produktionsplanung der Einzelkapitale. Sie weitet diese gesamtgesellschaftlich aus in dem Maß, in dem für das Einzelkapital (für das reale Kapital also) es zur unumgänglichen Rahmenbedingung geworden ist, daß gesellschaftliche Bewegungen und Prozesse in institutionell geregelter Weise überschaubar, kontrollierbar gemacht werden und letzten Endes jedes Gewicht für die kurz- oder langfristige Weiterentwicklung der Mehrwertproduktion verlieren.29 Und das wird von den politischen Vertretern des Kapitals durchaus erkannt, auch wenn sie verständlicherweise der Wirklichkeit einen verschleiernden Namen geben und die Neutralisierung des Klassenkampfs ordnungspolitische Sicherheit nennen - ein Wort indessen, das die Beziehungen zu spezifischen Formen der Unterdrückung keineswegs leugnet. Kurt Biedenkopf meint, „daß es zu den unerläßlichen Rahmenbedingungen einer marktwirtschaftlich betriebenen Wirtschaftspolitik gehört, den Unternehmen wenigstens für die Zeiträume ihrer eigenen Planungszyklen eine ordnungspolitische Sicherheit zu gewähren, d. h. ihnen eine verläßliche Auskunft darüber zu geben, mit welchen Änderungen im Bereich der gesellschaftlichen, gesellschaftspolitischen Daten sie rechnen müssen. Niemand ist bereit,... das allgemeine politische Risiko mit in Kauf zu nehmen, daß sich die ordnungspolitischen Daten kurzfristig grundlegend ändern”.30 Bildet die Gesellschaftsplanung einen Bestandteil der institutionellen Strategie, die praktische Umsetzung in der spezifisch bürgerlichen Formbestimmtheit der Politik (rechtlichstaatliche und rechtsstaatliche Regelhaftigkeit, organisatorische Zusammenfassung gesellschaftlicher Kräfte, Ritualisierung von Konflikten) einer permanent gewordenen, präventiven Konterrevolution,31 so erscheint sie vordergründig als bloße Willkürmaßnahme zur Herrschaftssicherung. Sie ruft daher den Eindruck einer massenfeindlichen, nur vom Machtstreben der Bourgeoisie bestimmten Verschwörung hervor.32 Es wird zwar immer einen komplexen Zusammenhang von Absprachen, objektiven Erfordernissen, informell vorgebrachten, aber manchmal auch sehr formell-institutionell weitergegebenen Wünschen geben. Ökonomie und Politik, konkret gesprochen die ökonomischen Herrschaftsgruppen (die Bourgeoisie) und die politischen Führungsgruppen zetteln keine förmliche Verschwörung gegen das Volk oder gegen die abhängigen Klassen an. Dennoch planen sie gemeinsam Maßnahmen und gesetzliche Regelungen und treffen ebenso gemeinsam die nötigen Anstalten - gewiß nicht „gegen das Volk”, sondern lediglich zu ihren eigenen Gunsten und zur Aufrechterhaltung der Kapitalreproduktion. Dazu gehört zum Beispiel, daß der Produktionsantagonismus nicht nur auf dem Weg der öffentlichen Kommunikation verdeckt wird, sondern ebenso sehr institutionell ausgeschaltet werden soll durch bewußt herbeigeführte Verlagerung politischer Interessen auf Einkommens- und Verteilungsprobleme: die tendenzielle Verschleierung des Klassenkonflikts der Produktionssphäre durch die Pluralität sektorialer Konflikte in der Distributionssphäre.33 Hier können nur Mystiker glauben, die spezifische Umpolung von Klassenunterschieden, die zum Beispiel unter dem Namen des Pluralismus läuft, erfolge planlos und ohne Arg: bewußtlose Folge geistesgeschichtlicher Entwicklung (für die einen) oder der Kapitalbewegung (für die anderen). Die Neutralisierung der Massenartikulation und des unmittelbaren Produktionsverhältnisses stellt jedoch kein politisches Machtprogramm dar - weder der Bourgeoisie noch der Politiker, so sehr die erstere an ihrer Herrschaft (auch eine Rahmenbedingung der Akkumulation) festhalten will und die letzteren in menschlich überaus verständlicher Weise gerne Träger von Machtbefugnissen bleiben oder werden wollen. Nicht der Machtanspruch macht den Plan und die damit verbundene Veränderung im politischen System (die Transformation des Verfassungsstaats) erforderlich, sondern der Akkumulationsprozeß. Erst in dessen Folge stellt sich das Machtproblem. Wäre ungestörte Akkumulation auch bei einer Verschärfung der Klassenkämpfe möglich, würde sich die Bourgeoisie mit der Institutionalisierung der Konfliktsituation begnügen und sich keineswegs auf einen Machtkampf einlassen. Ihre Klassenherrschaft gründet sich ökonomisch und braucht die unmittelbare Beteiligung an der Staatsmacht nicht.”翻译为中文","output":"上文已经简要讨论了国家干预的新方向。对国家干预竞争关系（危机管理；尝试性的资本利用组织；最终针对利润率趋势性下降的措施）以及干预增值过程（通过国家经济政策缓解不均衡和过度生产）的（旧）问题，在对资产阶级国家的功能分析中虽然不会变得无关紧要，至少是因为这样的危机政策-比如作为稳定政策-总是被尝试。但它在政治上转而占据了次要位置。真正的危机仍然可能在流通中表现出来，但它发生在与生产特定的冲突情况中。资本再生产的关键性（也就是说，在实际崩溃的前景中）不是由内在积累困难威胁，而是越来越多地通过剩余价值和交换价值的生产的干扰和破坏受到威胁。因此，简单地说，国家的各项计划措施和规划形式旨在通过制度性干预来保护资本的逻辑，即剩余价值生产的特定理性，免受劳动对增值的反叛和使用价值对交换价值的反叛。在这种情况下，资本失去了其主角地位。大众（“消费者”）和直接生产者成为主角：阶级关系突破进入资本运动，并证明其为决定性因素。 由于需要在生产连续性的压力下中和和消除明确的干扰，这完全源于生产方式的内在变化。因为不是无中生有，而是确切地沿着积累的高级阶段，一些资本主义国家中公开的阶级斗争的复苏以及大众更高的意识形态的展开。关键是，原本作为单纯劳动力而被资本关系征服的阶级，现在变得自主，挣脱了积累条件，几乎是用武力直接对资本进行攻击。所以，以特定意义呈现的社会规划既不是技术官僚们的意识形态（尽管以技术面目出现的领导层可能从中制造自己的意识形态），也不是希望符合资本的系统理论家们的幻想。无疑，在各个国家的特定情况、与各自资本集团相关的运动和协会之间的政治力量背后，可能存在着特别的计划法规和国家措施。这也构成了各个政党阵营的重要性和角色，它们可能会做出形式上各不相同的前瞻性决策。在社会政策指导尝试中，例如在劳动市场的调节、劳动斗争的法律规范（虽然在这里差异化规则的空间有限）以及现有财政资金的分配中，会出现显著的差异。在这里，特别是在规划阶段，技术“领袖”可能找到他们的空间。但重要的是，更准确、具体地把握规划的强制性和其性质，从而-在其他方面-避免将政治转向技术官僚主义的决断性评估。实际上，将规划元素、危机管理和集体事件的系统化作为非资本主义现象的倾向是当今资本主义的意识形态和掩饰趋势的一部分，而不是作为免受资本驱动或控制、不再受到增值利益约束的无阶级领导集团掌权的（积极）结果。国家组织者的一般规划任务实际上是从单个资本必需的生产规划中自然发展而来的。随着对单个资本（也就是实际资本）而言，社会运动和进程以制度化方式变得可预见、可控制，并最终失去对剩余价值生产短期或长期发展的任何重要性，变成不可避免的框架条件，就在整个社会上扩大了规划。而且，资本的政治代表充分认识到这一点，尽管他们理解地给现实命名一个掩饰性的名称，并将阶级斗争的中和称为治理政策安全 - 然而，这个词并不否认与特定形式的压迫的关系。库尔特·比登科普夫表示，“为市场经济政策提供至少在其自身规划周期内的治理政策安全性，是其不可或缺的框架条件之一，即向公司提供关于社会、社会政策数据可能发生的变化的可靠信息。没有人愿意...承担治理政策数据可能在短期内发生根本变化的一般政治风险。” 如果社会规划是制度策略的一部分，这种策略在特定于资产阶级形式上的政治（法律国家和法治的规则性、社会力量的组织汇总、冲突的仪式化）实践中变成了一种常态化的、预防性的反革命，那么它表面上出现为一种仅仅为了维持统治的专断措施。因此，它会激发出一种群众敌对情绪，仅由资产阶级的权力欲望决定的阴谋论印象。当然，总会有一系列的协商、客观要求、非正式提出的但有时也非常正式制度化传达的愿望的复杂联系。经济和政治，具体地说，经济统治集团（资产阶级）和政治领导集团并没有对人民或受依赖阶级发动正式的阴谋。然而，他们确实共同规划措施和法规，并同样共同采取必要的预防措施 - 当然不是“针对人民”，而只是为了他们自己的利益和维持资本再生产。这包括通过公共沟通隐藏生产对立，同样通过有意识地引发政治兴趣向收入和分配问题转移，从而制度性地消除对立：通过在分配领域的部门冲突的多样性，将生产领域的阶级冲突趋势性地模糊化。只有神秘主义者会相信特定的阶级差异重构，例如以多元主义之名进行，是无计划和无意图的：不自觉的智力发展结果（对于一些人来说）或资本运动的结果（对于另一些人来说）。 然而，大众表达和直接生产关系的中和不构成政治权力计划 - 无论是资产阶级还是政治家，尽管前者想要坚持其统治（也是积累的一个框架条件），后者以人类可理解的方式愿意继续或成为权力持有者。不是权力要求使规划及其相关的政治体制变化（宪政国家的转变）成为必要，而是积累过程。只有在继续积累的情况下，即使在阶级斗争加剧的情况下也是可能的，资产阶级才会满足于将冲突情况制度化，绝不会参与权力斗争。其阶级统治在经济上建立，并不需要直接参与国家权力。"},{"instruction":"请将“In anderen geschichtlichen Situationen unternahm die Bourgeoisie nichts gegen die politische MachtStellung des Adels, sofern sich dieser der Kapitalentfaltung nicht in den Weg stellte und deren formelle Bedingung: die Regelhaftigkeit, oder den Rechtsstaat akzeptierte (Beispiel Preußen).34 Gewiß muß dies - ebenso nach der geschichtlichen Spezifizierung - relativiert werden. Soziologisch gesehen geraten einzelne Kapitalfraktionen oder - gruppen in der Frage der politischen Formbestimmtheit in Gegensatz zu anderen und streben auch andere Formen der Machtausübung an. Der Sachverhalt ist von der Faschismus-Diskussion her hinlänglich bekannt. Ebenso kann in soziologischer Sicht die Transformation der politischen Formbestimmtheit, also die besondere Macht- und Verfassungsstruktur des Staats sich aus dem Zusammenwirken besonderer gesellschaftlicher Interessen einerseits, verschieden orientierter Führungsgruppen andererseits ergeben. Solche Bündniselemente sind zuweilen für die institutionelle Regelung durchaus bedeutsam. Man denke an die nachfaschistischen Verfassungen, die in einzelnen Ländern (zum Beispiel Frankreich und Italien -weitaus weniger Westdeutschland) eine Kompromißlösung darstellten - der labilen Klassenlage, aber auch der Verunsicherung über den weiteren Verlauf der weltpolitischen Konflikte geschuldet. Oberflächlich im bornierten Wortsinn sind diese geschichtlich feststehenden Erscheinungsformen nicht. Als Ausdruck wirklicher Prozesse übernehmen sie den entsprechenden Wirklichkeitsgrad. Demgegenüber ist es aber anders, wenn - in der schon angedeuteten Veränderung des Verhältnisses von ökonomischer Basis und politischem Überbau - die soziologische Sicht und die ideologische Faktendarstellung nicht gerade beiseite geräumt, aber doch ihrerseits relativiert werden. Der Staat als realer Organisator existiert weder neben und außer der Gesellschaft, noch kann er sich der materiellen Basis entheben. Alle Transformation des bürgerlichen Staats der Gegenwart: von faschistischehen Regimes über korporative Planungsstrukturen bis zur „Ordnungspolitik\\" und den Praktiken der „Sicherheitsüberprüfung\\", von der Machtverschiebung innerhalb der Verfassungsorgane bis zur Verstaatlichung der Parteien und der Gewerkschaften, findet ihre Grundlage in der Koppelung und im Widerspruch von Akkumulationsstand auf der einen Seite (der Seite des Kapitals) und Grad der Klassenreife (auf der Seite der Arbeit, gesellschaftlich gesehen des Proletariats). Diese wesentlichen Faktoren, als autonome Wirklichkeit genommen, entziehen sich aber sowohl dem politischen „Machttrieb\\" wie einem politisch durchsetzbaren Profit- und Überprofitstreben. Sie schaffen objektiv Widersprüche im Kapitalverhältnis, zu deren Auflösung der Staat mit seinen gesellschaftlichen Planmaßnahmen dazu tendieren muß, die gesellschaftliche Reproduktion zu verstaatlichen. Sofern der Staat sich durchsetzt in der Form von Staatsgesetzen, fällt diese spezifische Verstaatlichung gesellschaftlicher Beziehungen mit einer durchgängigen, tendenziell totalen Verrechtlichung zusammen. Die Verrechtlichung vollzieht sich freilich nicht in einem juristisch quantitativen Sinn: als bloße Inflation der Gesetzesmasse, als Überhandnehmen formaljuristischer Fixierungen. Es geht dabei vielmehr um die weitestgehend lückenlose Durchsetzung der sozialen Regelhaftigkeit mittels des Macht- und Gewaltmonopols und der Kontrollorgane des Staats. Sie findet auch bei Delegierung von Ordnungsbefugnissen, also von Kontroll- und Regulierungsmacht an gesellschaftliche Organisationen statt, da die Delegierung nicht naturwüchsig entsteht und gegen den Staat ohne dessen Sanktionierung wuchert, sondern rechtlich, verfassungsrechtlich und politisch geordnet und abgesichert wird. Es gehört genau zur Gesellschaftsplanung, sicherzustellen, daß die gesellschaftlich „autonom\\" getroffenen Vereinbarungen und stipulierten Abkommen (Tarifabkommen) sich keineswegs naturwüchsig oder entlang der Klassenkampfbewegung durchsetzen, sondern staatlich erzwingbar werden - etwa in der Form der arbeitsrechtlichen Verbindlichkeit und der arbeitsgerichtlichen Entscheidung. Verstaatlichung und Verrechtlichung bedeuten in erster Linie, daß alles Gesellschaftliche (Beziehungen, Kämpfe, Organisationsformen, Verhältnisse: Produktion und Reproduktion) sich in politisch überwachter, rechtlich-kontraktualer und nicht konfliktualer Form entwickelt. Daß solche Verstaatlichungstendenzen eine irreversible Rückentwicklung politisch offener Systeme bildet, daß also die Überschneidung von der sich erhöhenden organischen Zusammensetzung des Kapitals mit der Aufkündigung des „sozialen Friedens\\" durch die Arbeiterklasse in der Produktion, der Negierung der Profitfinalität in der Zirkulation die kapitalistische Gesellschaft zum autoritären Staat zwingt, braucht nicht weiter erörtert zu werden.35 Ein systemimmanenter Widerstand kann diese Involution nicht umkehren, auch wenn er punktuell der Verteidigung von Rechtspositionen dient. Die Forderung, gesellschaftliche Prozesse zu planen, ergeht nicht speziell an die jeweiligen Regierungen, sondern an das politische System als ganzes.36 Es ist dabei gleichgültig, ob die „organisierten Kräfte\\" reformistisch oder konservativ sind. Daß auch Parteien oder Fraktionen, die als linksreformistisch gelten, sich in die Zwangsfunktion einfinden, soziale Konflikte, namentlich zwischen Arbeit und Kapital „einzukapseln\\", zeigen die „linken\\" Reformvorschläge zur englischen Gewerkschaftsgesetzgebung und Arbeitskampfverfassung (vgl. Leviathan, 4/74, S. 484 f.). Höchstens variiert die jeweilige ideologische Begründung und sicherlich auch die Schärfe, mit der die Verrechtli¬chung ausfällt. Und ins Gewicht fallen auch die Unterschiede in der Verteilung der Lasten und Planungskosten, auch wenn am Ende die Hauptlast immer vom Hauptopfer getragen wird. Auf das sich daraus ergebende, für die Erarbeitung strategischer Perspektiven wichtige Problem der Vor- und Nachteile reformistischer oder konservativer Regierungen kann hier ebensowenig eingegangen werden wie auf die andere Frage, welche der beiden politischen Richtungen eher planungsfähig und planungswillig sei. Selbst das Kapital ist sich über diese Frage nicht im klaren. Sie ließe sich viel leichter lösen, bestünde sie wesentlich im ökonomischen. Vorhandene Ressourcen nach den allgemeinen Richtlinien programmierter oder programmierbarer Investitionen verwertungsorientiert und also akkumulationsfunktional einzusetzen, ist ein Geschäft, das vermutlich eine bourgeoise Partei besser besorgen kann als eine proletarische. Muß aber der Konflikt im unmittelbaren Produktionsverhältnis erfolgreich formalisiert werden, sieht die Sache schon anders aus. Selbst bei der Disziplinierung der Klasse im Fall der Massenarbeitslosigkeit bleibt es problematisch, welche Regierung am besten für die Regierbarkeit des Lands geeignet ist. Denn auch in diesem Fall liegt das Planungsziel nicht in möglichen Arbeitsmarktverschiebungen oder in Maßnahmen einer normalen, bekanntlich schon längst als illusionär erkannten Sozialpolitik,37 sondern in vorweg ausgebildeten Kanalisierungsinstrumenten, die den politischen Druck der arbeitslosen Massen auffangen. Da nicht die Arbeitslosigkeit die Kapitalreproduktion gefährdet (vielmehr gehört sie zur „Gesundschrumpfung” und wird von Seiten des Kapitals periodisch gefördert), sondern der Umschlag des sozialökonomischen Zustands (unverkäufliche Arbeitskraft und entsprechende physische Reproduktionsschwierigkeit der Klasse) in die politische Aktion, werden auf der politisch¬staatlichen Seite gerade die Arbeiterparteien und -Organisationen planungszuständig. Das theoretische Problem der Gesellschaftsplanung liegt in einem anderen Bereich - in dem schon oben erwähnten des Realitätscharakters des Staats und seiner effektiven Fähigkeit, Planungsaufgaben zu übernehmen.”翻译为中文","output":"在其他历史情境中，只要贵族不阻碍资本的展开并接受其形式条件：规则性，或者说法治国家（例如普鲁士），资产阶级就不会对贵族的政治地位采取行动。这当然需要根据历史具体情况进行相对化。从社会学角度来看，不同资本派别或团体在政治形式问题上发生对立，也追求不同的权力行使形式。这一情况在关于法西斯主义的讨论中已经被充分认识。同样，从社会学视角来看，政治形式的转变，也就是国家的特殊权力和宪法结构，可能源于特定社会利益的相互作用一方面，和不同导向的领导团体另一方面。这样的联盟元素有时对制度规定至关重要。考虑到某些国家（例如法国和意大利 - 西德国较少）中的后法西斯主义宪法，它们代表了一种妥协解决方案 - 受不稳定的阶级形势和对全球政治冲突进一步发展的不确定性所致。这些历史固定的表现形式在表面上并非狭隘意义上的肤浅。作为真实过程的表达，它们承担了相应的现实性。 然而，当经济基础与政治上层建筑的关系发生变化时 - 已经暗示的变化 - 社会学视角和意识形态的陈述不是被排除，但被相对化。国家作为现实的组织者既不是位于社会之外和之上的，也不能摆脱物质基础。当代资产阶级国家的所有转变：从法西斯主义政权到企业计划结构，再到“治理政策”和“安全审查”实践，从宪法机构内的权力转移到政党和工会的国有化，都基于资本积累水平（资本方面）和阶级成熟度之间的联系和矛盾（从工人阶级视角，社会上看作无产阶级）。这些基本因素作为自主现实被接受，却既不屈服于政治“权力欲”也不屈服于可通过政治实现的利润和超额利润追求。它们在资本关系中创造了客观矛盾，国家必须倾向于通过其社会规划措施解决这些矛盾，趋向于将社会再生产国家化。只要国家以国家法律的形式得以贯彻，这种特定的国家化社会关系就与全面的、潜在的总体法律化相一致。法律化实际上不是以法律数量意义上的：法律文本泛滥，正式法律固定过多。而是关于通过国家的权力和暴力垄断及其控制机构尽可能无缝地实施社会规则性。即使是将秩序权限、即控制和规制权力委托给社会组织，也是如此，因为委托不是自发产生的，没有国家的认可就会逆向生长，而是通过法律、宪法和政治有序和保障。确保社会上“自主”达成的协议和规定（如集体协议）不是自发实现或沿着阶级斗争运动实现，而是成为国家可强制执行的 - 例如以劳动法律效力和劳动法庭决定的形式。国家化和法律化首先意味着一切社会性（关系、斗争、组织形式、状况：生产和再生产）以政治监控的、法律合同式的而非冲突式的形式发展。这种国家化趋势构成了政治开放系统的不可逆转退化，因此不必进一步讨论将资本的有机组成提高与工人阶级在生产中“社会和平”的终结、在流通中否定利润最终目的的交叉，迫使资本主义社会向威权国家转变。系统内固有的抵抗不能逆转这种退化，即使它偶尔服务于保护法律地位。 对社会过程进行规划的要求不是特别针对各个政府，而是针对整个政治体系的。这里，无论“有组织的力量”是改革派还是保守派都无关紧要。即使被认为是左翼改革派的党派或派别，也适应了将社会冲突，尤其是工作与资本之间的冲突“封装起来”的强制功能，英国工会法律和工业斗争宪法的“左翼”改革建议就是证明（参见 Leviathan, 4/74, P. 484 f）。最多只是不同的意识形态理由和法律化的严格程度有所不同。并且负担和规划成本的分配差异也很重要，即使最终主要负担总是由主要受害者承担。在此无法讨论关于制定战略视角的重要问题，即改革派或保守派政府的利弊，以及哪个政治方向更有规划能力和意愿。即使资本对这个问题也不清楚。如果问题主要是经济的，根据规划的或可规划的投资通用指南将现有资源用于增值导向和因此积累功能的使用，很可能是资产阶级政党比无产阶级政党做得更好。但如果需要在直接的生产关系中成功地形式化冲突，情况就会不同。即使是在大规模失业情况下对阶级进行纪律约束，哪个政府最适合国家的治理也仍然是个问题。因为在这种情况下，规划目标不在于可能的劳动市场变动或正如所知的正常、长期被认为是幻想的社会政策中，而在于预先制定的引导工具，这些工具可以缓解失业大众的政治压力。 由于失业并不威胁资本再生产（相反，它属于“健康缩减”，并被资本方面周期性地促进），而是社会经济状况的转变（无法销售的劳动力和相应的阶级物理再生产困难）转化为政治行动，因此在政治-国家层面上，工人党派和组织成为规划责任方。 社会规划的理论问题位于另一个领域 - 在上文提到的国家的现实性和其承担规划任务的有效能力方面。"},{"instruction":"请将“Daß so selbstverständlich die Möglichkeit und die Wirksamkeit staatlicher Regulierungen im Kapitalismus für eine marxistisch sich verstehende Analyse nicht ist, zeigt sich an der verunsicherten Diskussion der letzten Zeit. Defensive Marx-Repetition findet sich stets verpflichtet, sich gegen technologisch-technokratische Vorschläge, Simulationen und Untersuchungen zu wenden. Dabei werden nicht nur ökonomische und Gesellschaftsplanung verwechselt oder in eins gesetzt, die Abhängigkeit der letzteren von einer sich der Planung entziehenden Kapitalbewegung nicht als Schranke begriffen, sondern in den abgeleiteten Beweis der Nichtexistenz umgemünzt. Ebenso ungünstig wirkt sich die permanente Verwechslung aus, den objektiv gegebenen Zwang zur Planung als Zwang zum Planungserfolg zu betrachten - obwohl man völlig zu recht auf die Widersprüchlichkeit so genannter Sachzwänge hinweist. Zentral für die strikte Leugnung bewußt vorgenommener Lenkungen in der gesellschaftlichen Reproduktion durch den kapitalistischen Staat ist aber die Bedeutung, die dem Wertgesetz beigemessen wird. Daß das Wertgesetz in der Kapitalbewegung sich hinter dem Rücken der Akteure und in der von ihm bewirkten Einheit von Produktion und Zirkulation „blind” durchsetzt; daß es in der Tat alle umfassende, über die Produktion der Einzelkapitale hinausgehende Programmierung und Lenkung der Zirkulation, alle ökonomisch gefaßte Organisation des Kapitalismus über den Haufen wirft, haben die letzten Entwicklungen auf dem Weltmarkt hinlänglich und erneut bewiesen. Allein gerade diese konkret erfahrbare Wirksamkeit begründet den Planungszwang. Das Wertgesetz verwandelt sich nirgends zu einem mystischen Demiurg mit totaler Zuständigkeit, dem alles Geschehen - von der Wiege bis zur Bahre des Kapitalismus - aufgebürdet werden könnte, einschließlich der revolutionären Negation.38 Umgekehrt: Der Planungszwang ergibt sich aus der Möglichkeit, daß ein Faktor der Mehrwertproduktion sich dem Wertgesetz bewußt entzieht und es insofern außer Kraft setzt. Das kann gewiß nicht der Staat mit einer gezielten, programmierten Wirtschaftspolitik leisten. Selbst die, in der Theorie des staatsmonopolistischen Kapitalismus angedeutete, antirevisionistisch heftig kritisierte Änderung des Wertgesetzes durch die Garantie der Extraprofite hebt dessen Wirksamkeit nicht auf, sondern verschiebt nur dessen Folgen und führt zu neuen Erscheinungsformen.39 Das Wertgesetz kann vielmehr nur von demjenigen Produktionsfaktor außer Kraft gesetzt werden, der es überhaupt erst in Kraft treten läßt - obgleich unter dem Zwang, sich als Arbeitskraft zu verkaufen. Marx betonte diese Seite (die Seite des subjektiven Faktors im revolutionären Prozeß) durchaus, auch wenn er in der verkürzten Formel von der Expropriation der Expropriateurs das Ende der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise als scheinbar deterministisch¬mechanisch sich ergebende Folge der „immanenten Gesetze der kapitalistischen Produktion selbst” erscheinen läßt (Kapital, 1, MEW 23, S. 790 f. Ebenda heißt es allerdings auch: Zu diesen Gesetzen gehört auch das Wachsen der Empörung der „durch den Mechanismus des kapitalistischen Produktionsprozesses selbst geschulten, vereinten und organisierten Arbeiterklasse” - eine interessante Bemerkung, die bei der Behandlung der Organisations- und Parteifrage meist vergessen wird). In der abstrakt-ökonomischen Sicht gehören allerdings Wertgesetz und Staat getrennten Bereichen an; und staatliche Versuche zur Planung des Verhältnisses Arbeit-Kapital fielen in der Tat ins Wasser der Ideologie. In der gleichen, nur politisch verscho benen, von der Ortodoxie zum Revisionismus verkommenden Sicht aber zeigte sich die bewußte revolutionäre Bewegung, die politische Negation des Wertgesetzes als abgeleitet und relativ belanglos. Sie wäre im großen geschichtlichen Sinn buchstäb lich unnötig. Der Übergang zum Kommunismus, Ergebnis der „Verkehrsform selbst” und eines sich zur Negationsspitze selbst treibenden Gesetzes bedürfte der Arbeiterrebellion nicht. Sie würde sich förmlich ereignen und die revolutionäre Organisa tion des Proletariats entspräche als „bewußter” Träger eines bloßen Ereignisses der (meines Erinnerns von Max Weber so definierten) alten Sozialdemokratie: ein Verein, gebildet zur Herbeiführung einer ohnehin stattfindenden Mondfinsternis. Nicht, daß die vom Wertgesetz bestimmte, ökonomische Bewegung und die dadurch bedingten gesellschaftlichen Reproduktionsprozesse widerspruchslos wären. Das Wertgesetz konkretisiert in sich den Widerspruch des Kapitalismus. Allein: In diesen Widerspruch muß erst die nicht zur Logik der Kapitalbewegung gehörende Logik der Revolution einrasten, um seine Sprengkraft zu entfalten. Das System der Mehrwertproduktion wird also zwar entlang seiner Widersprüchlichkeit, aber nur von seiner Negation überwunden: „der Klassenkampf als Schluß, worin sich die Bewegung und die Auflösung der ganzen Scheiße auflöst” (Marx, MEW 32, 75). Daher besteht kein Gegensatz zwischen dem Wirken des Wertgesetzes und dem Versuch einer Regelung gesellschaftlicher Prozesse durch den staatlichen Organisator, der sich gegen die „Auflösung der ganzen Scheiße” wenden und das Ausscheren des unmittelbaren Produzenten verhindern will. Derart kann von einem Zusammenhang zwischen blind wirkendem Wertgesetz und bewußter politischer Perspektivwahl und -entscheidung der Führungsgruppen gesprochen werden. Scheinbar paradox, gänzlich unorthodox und also genuin marxistisch zusammengefaßt: Der Staat hat die Funktion, durch seinen Eingriff in die gesellschaftliche Repro- duktion und vor allem in das unmittelbare Produktionsverhält-nis das Wertgesetz entweder präventiv aufrechtzuerhalten oder - in revolutionären Situationen - wieder in Kraft zu setzen: Die Kontinuität der Mehrwertproduktion soll die Gesellschaft bestimmen, und nicht das rebellische Verhältnis des Arbeiters zur Verwertung noch die Ablösung der Tauschwertfunktionalität durch die Rationalität der Bedürfnisse. Das bedeutet allerdings, daß das vermittelte Interesse des Kapitals an seinem Staat eine Verlagerung erfährt. Bekanntlich hat der Staat seit jeher um der Akkumulation willen den Einzelkapitalen Bedingungen und teilweise Beschränkungen der Selbstverwertung aufgenötigt. Im heutigen Akkumulationsstadium kommt noch eine neue Zwangslage des Kapitals und zugleich eine Veränderung in dem politischen Bewußtsein der Kapitalisten hinzu: bestimmte Opfer ohne weitere Korruptionsund Umpolungsversuche (Abwälzung auf jeweils andere Kapitalisten) auf sich zu nehmen, um die eigene Weiterexistenz zu sichern - es versteht sich aber dabei von selbst: immer unter der Voraussetzung der Funktionstreue des Staats und der Politik gegenüber der Akkumulation. Aber in der entsprechenden Veränderung gilt für den Kapitalisten das gleiche Prinzip, das sich negativ für den Arbeiter auswirkt. Nicht die Qualität des Lebens in der Fabrik, sondern das Leben der Fabrik ist entscheidend; nicht die Quantität des Profits, sondern das Leben des Profits. Das vermittelte Interesse geht hier beträchtlich über die naturwüchsige Interessiertheit an der Profitmaximie-rung hinaus und zielt eindeutig - koste es, was es wolle, wenn nur die Kosten in den Grenzen der Akkumulation bleiben -auf den Schutz des Gesamtorganisators: auf die Verteidigung des ganzen Staats. Bildet die Kontinuität der Produktion bei einem hohen Entwicklungsgrad des Kapitals die Grundbedingung seiner Reproduktion, so fällt sie mit der Kontinuität der „Regierbarkeit” und der Kontrolle und mit der tendenziellen Kontinuierlichkeit der gesellschaftlichen Lenkung als der politischen Garantie der Produktion zusammen. Die Priorität der Gesellschaftsplanung gegenüber der ökonomischen bestätigt auf diese Weise die politische Verschiebung, die im Verhältnis Staat¬Kapital stattgefunden hat: rein äußerlich eine „Autonomisierung” der Politik und die Bildung staatseigener Kompetenzen, deren Träger sozusagen partnerschaftlich mit den Trägern des Kapitals (mit den Monopolherren) in eine Allianzverbindung treten; in Wirklichkeit nur die Verlötung zwischen Funktionalität des Staats und funktionierenden Akkumulationsbedingungen. Der Staat wird in das Kapitalverhältnis hereingeholt.”翻译为中文","output":"在资本主义中，国家调节的可能性和有效性对于马克思主义分析来说并不是理所当然的，这在最近的讨论中表现出的不确定性中可以看出。保守的马克思重复总是觉得有必要反对技术官僚主义的提议、模拟和研究。在这过程中，不仅误将经济和社会规划混为一谈，将后者对资本运动无法进行规划的依赖性误解为一个局限，而是错误地认为这证明了非存在性。同样不利的是永久性地混淆，将规划的客观必要性视为规划成功的强制性 - 尽管完全正确地指出所谓的“客观约束”的矛盾性。 对于资本主义国家是否能够有意识地在社会再生产中进行干预的严格否认，关键在于对价值规律的重要性的认识。价值规律在资本运动中“在参与者背后”和它引发的生产与流通的统一中“盲目”地实现；实际上它推翻了所有超越单个资本生产的全面规划和流通的组织，所有经济上构想的资本主义组织，在世界市场上的最近发展中已经充分并再次证明了这一点。然而，正是这种具体可体验的有效性构成了规划的压力。价值规律并没有变成一个神秘的全能创造者，将所有事件——从资本主义的摇篮到坟墓——包括革命性的否定，都归咎于它。相反：规划的压力源自于剩余价值生产的一个因素有意识地逃避价值规律，从而在某种程度上使其失效。当然，这不是国家通过有目的的、计划化的经济政策能够实现的。即使在所谓的国家垄断资本主义理论中暗示的，通过保障额外利润来改变价值规律的反修正主义激烈批评，并没有消除其有效性，而只是转移了其后果，并导致了新的表现形式。价值规律更多是由那个生产要素使其失效的，这个要素首先使其生效——尽管在不得不作为劳动力出售自己的压力下。马克思确实强调了这一面（革命过程中的主观因素方面），即使他在“剥削者的剥削”这个简化公式中将资本主义生产方式的终结表现为“资本主义生产自身的内在规律”所必然导致的结果（资本论，第一卷，MEW 23, 790页）。然而，他也指出：“这些规律还包括‘通过资本主义生产过程本身培训、联合和组织起来的工人阶级’愤怒的增长”——这是一个有趣的评论，在讨论组织和党的问题时常被忽略）。在抽象经济学视角下，价值规律和国家属于分开的领域；而国家对劳动-资本关系的规划尝试实际上落入了意识形态的水域。但在同样的，仅仅从正统到修正主义的政治视角转变中，表现出的有意识的革命运动，对价值规律的政治否定被视为派生的且相对无关紧要。在大的历史意义上，这几乎是不必要的。通向共产主义的过渡，作为“交通形式本身”的结果和自我推动到否定高点的规律，不需要工人阶级的叛乱。它会自发地发生，而无产阶级的革命组织作为一个“有意识的”承载者，对应于（据我记得马克斯·韦伯定义的）旧社会民主党：一个为了促成一个本来就会发生的月食而组建的协会。这并不是说由价值规律决定的经济运动和由此引起的社会再生产过程没有矛盾。价值规律在其内部具体化了资本主义的矛盾。然而：只有当与资本运动逻辑无关的革命逻辑介入这一矛盾时，它才能释放其爆炸力。因此，剩余价值生产的体系虽然沿着其矛盾性发展，但只能通过其否定来克服：“阶级斗争作为结束，其中整个混乱的运动和解决都得以解决”（马克思，MEW 32, 75）。因此，价值规律的运作与国家组织者企图通过调节社会过程来防止“整个混乱的解决”和防止直接生产者的背离之间并无矛盾。因此，可以谈论盲目作用的价值规律与领导团队的有意识政治视角选择和决定之间的联系。看似矛盾，完全非正统，因此纯粹地马克思主义总结：国家的功能，通过其对社会再生产的干预，特别是对直接生产关系的干预，要么是预防性地维持价值规律，要么是在革命情况下重新启动它：社会应由剩余价值生产的连续性决定，而不是工人对增值的叛逆关系，也不是通过需求合理性替代交换价值功能。 这意味着，资本对其国家的间接利益发生了转移。众所周知，国家为了积累的缘故，向单个资本强加条件并部分限制了自我增值。在当今的积累阶段，资本的新的强制状况以及资本家政治意识的变化又增加了一层：在没有进一步的腐败和转嫁尝试（转嫁给其他资本家）的情况下承担某些牺牲，以保证自己的持续存在 - 当然，这一切都是以国家和政策对积累忠诚的前提下。但在相应的变化中，资本家面临的是与工人产生负面影响的同一原则。不是工厂里的生活质量，而是工厂的生命至关重要；不是利润的数量，而是利润的生命。这种间接利益远远超出了对利润最大化的自然兴趣，并明确地指向了——不惜一切代价，只要成本保持在积累的范围内——对整个组织者的保护：对整个国家的防御。 如果在资本的高度发展阶段生产的连续性构成了其再生产的基本条件，那么它与“可治理性”和控制的连续性以及作为生产政治保证的社会引导倾向性的连续性相一致。社会规划相对于经济规划的优先级以这种方式确认了在国家与资本关系中发生的政治转变：从表面上看是政治的“自主化”以及形成国家自有的能力，其承载者似乎与资本的承载者（与垄断大亨）以伙伴关系进入联盟关系；实际上只是国家功能与运行中的积累条件之间的焊接。国家被纳入了资本关系之中。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
