This involves understanding the geometric properties of the semicircle omega with diameter overline{BC}. Thales' Theorem helps us here, stating that any angle subtended by the diameter of a semicircle is a right angle. 2. **Understanding Thales' Theorem**:    According to Thales' Theorem:    - angle BPC < 90^circ if point P lies inside omega (the semicircle).    - angle BPC = 90^circ if point P lies on omega (the circumference of the semicircle).    - angle BPC > 90^circ if point P lies outside omega. 3. **Calculation of the Area of Interest**:    We compute the area within the square ABCD where angle BPC > 90^circ, which corresponds to the area outside omega. 4. **Calculate Area of omega**:    The diameter overline{BC} of omega is equal to the side length of the square, which we set to 1 unit for simplicity.

Substituting A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) into the ellipse equation frac{x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1, and using the method of differences, we find k_{AB} = frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}} = -frac{x}{2y}, and k_{OM} = frac{y}{x}. From this, we can determine the product of the slopes of line AB and line OM. This problem examines the method of finding the product of the slopes of two lines, which is a medium-level question.

To find P%, we can set up the equation: ( frac{P}{100} times 1250 = 87.50 ) Now, we solve for P: ( P times 1250 = 87.50 times 100 ) ( P times 1250 = 8750 ) ( P = frac{8750}{1250} ) ( P = 7 ) Therefore, the percentage of the import tax is boxed{7%} ."},{"instruction":"Given that the line l is perpendicular to the line x  y  1 = 0, the slope angle alpha of line l is ___.","output":"To determine the angle of slope alpha for line l, we first need to consider the slope of the given line x - y -1 = 0.

The slope m of this line is 1, which corresponds to a slope angle, let's call it theta, of 45^circ for a line that increases from left to right in the coordinate plane. Since line l is perpendicular to the line with equation x - y - 1 = 0, it will have a negative reciprocal slope. Specifically, if the slope of one line is m, the slope of a line perpendicular to it is -1/m. In our case, the slope of line l is -1/1 = -1. We want to find the slope angle alpha of line l, knowing its slope is -1. A line with a slope of -1 has a slope angle that is 90^circ more than the angle for a line with slope 1, because we must rotate the line 90^circ clockwise to get from a positive slope to a negative slope of the same magnitude. Adding that rotation to the original 45^circ yields theta_l = theta + 90^circ = 45^circ + 90^circ = 135^circ. Hence, the slope angle alpha of line l is 135^circ.

Let g(x) = x^2ln x - (x^2-1)(ax-a+1) = x^2cdot 2a(x-1) - (x-1)(x^2-a+1). If g(x) geq 0, then the equation f(x) = (x-1)(ax-a+1) has no solutions. When x in left(frac{1}{2a}, +inftyright), h(x) < 0, and h(x) is a decreasing function on left(frac{1}{2a}, +inftyright). From f(x) = (x-1)(ax-a+1), we get f(x) - (x-1)(ax-a+1) = 0, which simplifies to ax^2 - x^2 - a + 1 = a(x^2 + a - 1)(x - 1). Thus, f'(x) = 2, and since f(e) = e, g(x) is decreasing on (1, x_1) and (x_2, +infty), and increasing on (x_1, x_2). Moreover, hleft(frac{1}{2a}right) = lnleft(frac{1}{2a}right) - 1 + 2 > 0. When x > frac{1-a}{a}, g(x) > 0, so the equation f(x) = (x-1)(ax-a+1) has exactly one solution. Let x_1 in left(1, frac{1}{2a}right) and x_2 in left(frac{1}{2a}, +inftyright). Therefore, h(x) = g(x) has one zero in each of the intervals left(1, frac{1}{2a}right) and left(frac{1}{2a}, +inftyright). If frac{1}{2a} leq 1, i.e., a geq frac{1}{2}, then h(x) < h(0), which implies g'(x) < 0. Since x_1 < e, and ln x > 0, g'(x) = ln x + 1 - (ax - a + 1) - (ax - a)ln x - 2a(x - 1), the curve y = f(x) has an inflection point at (e, f(e)). Therefore, g(x) has an extreme point in each of the intervals left(1, frac{1}{2a}right) and left(frac{1}{2a}, +inftyright).

Therefore, the statement is trivially true for n = 1.    For n = 2:      If there are two inhabitants, each one can make a call to the other exactly once. This satisfies the condition that each resident makes at most one phone call.    Hence, the base case for n leq 2 is true. 2. **Inductive Step**:    Assume that the statement holds for a city with k inhabitants, where each inhabitant makes at most one phone call in a day, and the total number of phone calls m leq k.    Now, consider a city with k+1 inhabitants. We need to show that in this scenario, each inhabitant still makes at most one phone call in a day and the total number of phone calls m' leq k+1. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis**:    Suppose that in a city with k inhabitants, the statement holds true. Out of the k+1 inhabitants, consider one specific inhabitant, say A. There are two possibilities:    - Inhabitant A does not make any phone calls.    - Inhabitant A makes exactly one phone call.     In either case, if we remove inhabitant A from the city, we are left with k inhabitants where each inhabitant can make at most one phone call. By our inductive hypothesis, the total number of phone calls in this sub-city is m leq k.  4. **Consideration for k+1 inhabitants**:    If inhabitant A did not make any phone calls, the total number of phone calls remains m leq k. If inhabitant A made exactly one phone call, the total number of phone calls is m + 1 leq k + 1.     In both cases, we see that for k+1 inhabitants, the total number of phone calls m' leq k + 1, satisfying the condition. 5. **Conclusion**:    By mathematical induction, we have shown that if the statement holds for k inhabitants, it must also hold for k + 1 inhabitants.

Each rabbit has two alleles of the same gene responsible for the type of fur. Let H (or h) represent the hairy allele, and S (or s) represent the smooth allele. If a rabbit has different alleles, the fur type depends on which allele is dominant and which is recessive. Capital letters are used for dominant alleles, and lowercase letters for recessive alleles. Thus, if the genotype (combination of alleles) is H s, the rabbit will be hairy despite having a smooth allele. If the genotype is h S, the rabbit will be smooth. Each parent passes one of their alleles to the offspring. For example, if the father has the genotype h h and the mother has the genotype h S, the offspring can inherit the h allele from the father, and either the h or S allele from the mother with equal probability. Therefore, the offspring has a 0.5 probability of having the genotype h h and a 0.5 probability of having the genotype h S.

This suggests that:      - The fuzzy trait (allele H) is strongly expressed and is the dominant trait.      - Each parent must contribute the dominant allele to each offspring. 4. **Determine the genotype of fuzzy parent**:    - Considering the fuzzy rabbit could be either HH or HS:      - If the parent was HH, all offspring would receive H inevitably, leading to all fuzzy offspring.      - If the parent was HS, the other rabbit gene would make it a hit or miss in offspring, since distribution would yield a mix of smooth and fuzzy.    - Therefore, it is highly plausible that the fuzzy rabbit's genotype is HH to ensure all offspring solely receive a dominant gene H at each cross. 5. **Determine the genotype of smooth-haired parent**:    - If the smooth-haired rabbit has an SS genotype, no fuzzy offspring would appear:      - This leaves the likely scenario: the smooth-haired parent must contribute a recessive gene h, consistent with an Sh genotype in the cross ensuring the offspring:      - Her h combined with H from the fuzzy rabbit yields fuzzy offspring. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Given the offspring results:      - The most likely genotype for the fuzzy rabbit is HH.      - The most likely genotype for the smooth-haired rabbit is Sh.

The probability that one die shows an odd number remains frac{1}{2}. Thus, for eight independent dice rolls: [ left(frac{1}{2}right)^8 = frac{1}{256}. ] **Step 2: Calculate the probability of the product being divisible by 2, but not by 4.**   This scenario occurs when exactly one die rolls a number contributing exactly one factor of 2 (i.e., 2 itself), and the remaining 7 dice roll odd numbers.

Given omega' = -frac{3}{2} + ifrac{sqrt{3}}{2} and omega'^{12}, knowing that omega^2+1 = -frac{3}{2}, we can express omega' as 3omega^2 and omega'^{12} = (3omega^2)^{12} = 3^{12} cdot (omega^2)^{12}. 1. Since omega^2 is a cube root of unity, (omega^2)^3 = 1, so (omega^2)^{12} = ((omega^2)^3)^4 = 1^4 = 1. 2. Substituting this result gives (3omega^2)^{12} = 3^{12} = 531441. 3.

Show that (sqrt{2}) cannot be written as an irreducible fraction (p/q).","output":"1. **Introduction of the Problem:**    We want to show that sqrt{2} cannot be written as a fraction in its simplest form frac{p}{q}, where ( p ) and ( q ) are integers and the fraction is in its least terms (irreducible). 2. **Assumption for Proof by Contradiction:**    Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that sqrt{2} can be written as an irreducible fraction:    [    sqrt{2} = frac{p}{q}    ]    where ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). 3. **Square Both Sides:**    Square both sides of the equation to utilize the definition of sqrt{2}:    [    (sqrt{2})^2 = left(frac{p}{q}right)^2     ]    which simplifies to:    [    2 = frac{p^2}{q^2}    ]    Then, multiply both sides by q^2 to clear the fraction:    [    2 q^2 = p^2    ] 4. **Parity Argument for ( p ):**     From the equation ( p^2 = 2q^2 ):    [    p^2 = 2q^2    ]    This equation shows that p^2 is even because it is two times another integer (2q^2). From number theory, if p^2 is even, then p itself must be even (since the square of an odd number is odd). 5. **Expressing ( p ) with an Even Integer:**    Let ( p = 2k ) for some integer ( k ). Substituting this into the equation ( p^2 = 2q^2 ):    [    (2k)^2 = 2q^2    ]    This simplifies to:    [    4k^2 = 2q^2    ]    Divide both sides by 2:    [    2k^2 = q^2    ]    This equation shows that ( q^2 ) is also even, which implies that ( q ) is even (again, if the square of a number is even, the number itself must be even). 6. **Contradiction:**    Since ( p ) and ( q ) are both even, we can write ( p = 2k ) and ( q = 2m ) for some integers ( k ) and ( m ). This means both ( p ) and ( q ) have a common factor of 2, which contradicts the assumption that ( frac{p}{q} ) is in its simplest form (irreducible). 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the assumption that sqrt{2} can be expressed as an irreducible fraction (frac{p}{q}) leads to a contradiction. Thus, sqrt{2} cannot be written as a fraction in simplest form.    [blacksquare]"},{"instruction":"Circle (C) has its center at ((4, 3)) and a radius of (5) units.

Now, we need to find the maximum number of unmarried women under the age of 40 who do not work in management positions. Since we are looking for the maximum number, we will assume that all married people are women, which is the worst-case scenario for unmarried women under 40 not in management. If all 50 married people are women, then there are 90 - 50 = 40 unmarried women. However, we know that 45 women are under 40, so if all married women were over 40, then all 45 women under 40 would be unmarried. Now, we need to subtract the number of married women in management positions from the total number of women under 40 to find the maximum number of unmarried women under 40 who do not work in management.

We are given that the center of the circle passing through A, C, and H lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 2. Let K be the center of the circle passing through A, C, and H. Since K lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, K must be the midpoint of the arc AC that does not contain B. This is because the center of the circle passing through A, C, and H must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AC and also on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 3. Since K is the midpoint of the arc AC, it is equidistant from A and C. Therefore, KA = KC. Also, K lies on the perpendicular bisector of AH and CH. 4. Consider the triangle AHC. Since K is the circumcenter of triangle AHC, the radius of the circumcircle of triangle AHC is KA = KC. Let M be the midpoint of BC.

The amount of acid in the original solution before any replacement is 0.50V (since it's a 50% solution). The amount of acid removed when xV liters of the original solution is taken out is 0.50 * xV. The amount of acid in the xV liters of the 20% solution that is added is 0.20 * xV.

Now, if we want to find out how many days it would take for A and B to complete the work together, we can use the combined work rate: 1/A's rate + 1/B's rate = 1/Combined rate 1/(W/8) + 1/(W/24) = 1/Combined rate To find the combined rate, we'll add the individual rates: Combined rate = (W/8) + (W/24) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 24: Combined rate = (3W/24) + (1W/24) Combined rate = (3W + W)/24 Combined rate = 4W/24 Combined rate = W/6 So, A and B together can complete the work in boxed{6}  days, as given in the initial statement."},{"instruction":"The equation of the line 2x  y  4 = 0 is rotated counterclockwise by frac{pi}{4} about its intersection point with the xaxis.

This means the remaining distance to place B for Xiaogang is 0.5x km. Since the total distance from A to B is the sum of the distances both traveled until they met, we have: [2x + (2x - 24) = 0.5x] However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the original solution's interpretation of this part. The correct interpretation should be that the distance Xiaogang travels to meet Xiaoqiang plus the distance he travels after meeting equals his total travel distance when they meet, which is not directly related to the 0.5x term. The 0.5x term represents the distance Xiaogang travels after they meet, indicating the speed and time relationship, not the total distance traveled by both before meeting.  Given this, the correct approach to find Xiaogang's speed is to solve for x from the equation given by the difference in distance traveled when they meet: [2x - (2x - 24) = 24] This equation simplifies to: [24 = 24] Which indicates that the information provided directly leads us to the conclusion about the difference in their traveled distances but does not directly solve for x. The correct equation derived from the information that Xiaogang takes 0.5 hours to reach place B after they meet is not provided in the original solution.  **Correcting the Solution:** Given the confusion, let's clarify the steps to solve for x correctly: - Since Xiaogang travels 24 km more than Xiaoqiang in 2 hours, and he takes 0.5 hours to reach B after they meet, we infer the speed of Xiaogang based on the distance he covers after they meet. If he reaches B in 0.5 hours, and considering the distances they traveled until they met, we should correctly establish the equation based on speeds or additional information provided. **Step 3: Calculate Xiaoqiang's Speed** Once Xiaogang's speed is correctly determined to be x = 16 km/h (assuming this from the provided solution without the direct equation leading to it), Xiaoqiang's speed can be calculated as: [2x - 24 = 2 times 16 - 24 = 32 - 24 = 8] [8 div 2 = 4] km/h **Step 4: Calculate Time for Xiaoqiang to Arrive at Place A** Given Xiaogang's speed is 16 km/h, and Xiaoqiang's speed is 4 km/h, the time it takes for Xiaoqiang to arrive at place A after they meet can be found by considering the distance Xiaoqiang needs to cover and his speed. However, the direct calculation for this time based on the distance Xiaoqiang has left to travel is not provided in the solution. Assuming the total distance is the sum of what they both traveled until they met, and using the speeds to calculate the time for Xiaoqiang to cover his remaining distance would be the correct approach. Given the inconsistencies and missing direct calculations in the provided solution, the correct step-by-step solution should include clear equations to solve for Xiaogang's speed, Xiaoqiang's speed, and the time it takes for Xiaoqiang to reach place A. The final answers, based on the provided solution, are: - Xiaogang's speed: 16 km/h - Xiaoqiang's speed: 4 km/h - Time for Xiaoqiang to arrive at place A after they meet: 8 hours Therefore, the corrected and detailed answers are: The speeds of Xiaogang and Xiaoqiang are boxed{16 text{ km/h}} and boxed{4 text{ km/h}} respectively.

Find the angles of triangle ( ABC ).","output":"To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the properties given and using the similarity criteria for triangles. 1. **Understanding Configuration**: Segment (BE) divides the triangle (ABC) into two similar triangles, (triangle ABE) and (triangle BEC), with a similarity ratio of (sqrt{3}). 2. **Identifying Possible Scenarios**:    Since ( angle AEB + angle BEC = 180^circ ), these angles cannot both be angles from the two similar triangles. Hence, (BE) must be perpendicular to one of the triangle's sides, making one of the triangles a right triangle. 3. **Analyze the Division**:    Consider the two possibilities:    - Case 1: (angle ABE = angle CBE)    - Case 2: (angle ABE = angle BCE)    We discard Case 1 because if (angle ABE = angle CBE), then (triangle ABE) and (triangle CBE) would be congruent (not just similar), which contradicts the given similarity ratio. Thus, Case 2 holds. 4. **Determine the Angles**:    In the valid scenario ((angle ABE = angle BCE)), it implies that (BE) is perpendicular to (AC). Hence, (triangle ABC) is a right-angled triangle where (angle ABC = 90^circ). 5. **Evaluating the Sides and Other Angles**:    Since ( triangle ABE ) and ( triangle BEC ) are similar by a ratio of (sqrt{3}), we can deduce the proportion of sides. Specifically, if (ABE) is similar to (BEC) with ratio (sqrt{3}), one of the angles will be (30^circ) and (60^circ) considering (triangle ABC) is a right triangle with sides in the ratio (1 : sqrt{3}).

Each term ( x_i ) is either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ).  Consider the squared sum of these terms: [ left( x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n} right)^{2} ] Expanding this expression, we obtain: [ left( x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n} right)^{2} = x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + cdots + x_{n}^{2} + 2 sum_{1 le i < j le n} x_{i}x_{j} ] Since each ( x_i ) is either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ), ( x_{i}^{2} = 1 ) for each ( i ). Therefore, we can rewrite the right-hand side as: [ n + 2 sum_{1 le i < j le n} x_{i}x_{j} ] Notice that the sum of the products of all pairs of ( x_i )'s, taken ( k ) steps apart, equals zero for all ( k ) ranging from 1 to ( n-1 ): [ x_{1}x_{2} + x_{2}x_{3} + cdots + x_{n}x_{1} = 0 ] By summing the reiterations of such products, as implied by the problem statement, all interactions between pairs cancel out. Thus, the entire summation of cross products is 0: [ sum_{1 le i < j le n} x_{i}x_{j} = 0 ] This gives us: [ left( x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n} right)^{2} = n ] Hence, ( n ) must be a perfect square, as it is equal to the square of the sum of integers which are 1 or -1. Therefore, ( n ) is a perfect square.  Part (b): Let's assume that there exists a set satisfying the condition for ( n = 16 ). Then, we're working with 16 numbers ( x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{16} ). Assume without loss of generality that ( x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{16} geq 0 ) (if this sum were negative, by symmetry, change the signs of all numbers).

To verify if such a configuration satisfies the problem's constraints, examine whether it meets the sum condition for every step ( k ): [ sum_{i=1}^{16} x_{i}x_{i+k} = 0, quad k = 1, 2, ldots, 15 ] Let's arrange these numbers around a circle, and mark the positions of \`-1\` values. Denote each ( 1/16 ) portion of the circle as ( alpha ), corresponding to ( 22.5^circ ). Rotating the entire configuration by an angle ( k alpha ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 15 ), observe whether the number of negative units returning to their initial marked positions remains balanced.  Assume that 4 of the \`-1\` units previously marked in initial positions remain there: [ text{Sum of products} = 2r = 8 implies r = 4 ] Each rotation implies exactly two of the \`-1\` units return to negative positions previously held by other \`-1\` units.

To find the maximum of ln L(a, sigma^2), take partial derivatives with respect to a and sigma^2, setting them to zero:    - For a:      [      frac{partial (ln L(a, sigma^2))}{partial a} = frac{partial}{partial a} left( -frac{1}{2sigma^2}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - a)^2 right) = -frac{1}{sigma^2} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a) = 0      ]      Solving it,      [      sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a) = 0 quad Rightarrow quad n a = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i quad Rightarrow quad a = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i      ]    - For sigma^2:      [      frac{partial (ln L(a, sigma^2))}{partial sigma^2} = -frac{n}{2sigma^2} + frac{1}{2 (sigma^2)^2} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)^2 = 0      ]      Solving it,      [      -frac{n}{2sigma^2} + frac{1}{2 (sigma^2)^2} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)^2 = 0      ]      [      frac{1}{sigma^2} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)^2 = n      ]      [      sigma^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)^2      ] 5. Hence, the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters a and sigma^2 are:    [    a = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i    ]    [    sigma^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - a)^2    ] Conclusion:  [ boxed{ a = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i, quad sigma^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - a)^2 } ] This example also demonstrates that the maximum likelihood estimate for sigma^2, hat{sigma}^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - bar{x})^2, is biased. This shows that in general, the method of maximum likelihood gives biased estimates, which might need further correction."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements are correct?

We are to prove that such a sequence contains infinitely many powers of 2 if and only if (a_{1}) is not divisible by 5. 1. **Analyze the behavior when (a_{1}) is divisible by 5:**    If (a_{1}) is divisible by 5, then (a_1 equiv 0 pmod{5}).    - For any (k in mathbb{N}), (2^k neq 0 pmod{10}).         - Assume (a_1 = 10m) for some (m in mathbb{N}).         - In this case, (b_{n} = 0) for all (n geq 1), so (a_{n}) will always end in 0. Thus,         [    a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 0 = a_{n}    ]        - Therefore, (a_n) remains a multiple of 10 for all (n geq 2), and none of the terms (a_n) can be a power of 2, since powers of 2 do not end in 0 in their decimal representation other than for (2^k = 10), which is impossible as (2^k) modulo 10 never yields 0. 2. **Analyze the behavior when (a_{1}) is not divisible by 5:**    Assume (a_{1}) is not divisible by 5. This implies that the last digit of (a_{1}) is not 0 or 5. We analyze the sequence modulo 10:    (a_1 pmod{10}) can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9.    Observations:    - Since ((a_n)) is a sequence of natural numbers, (b_n) (the last digit of (a_n)) will cycle through 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.    - The sequence (b_n) is linked to base 10, so every fourth power of 2 modulo 10 repeats as 2, 4, 8, 6.    Consider the case (a_{n}equiv 2 pmod{10}).    - If we have (a_1 = 10t + 2), then:    [    a_{2} = 10t + 2 + 2 = 10t + 4    ]    - Continue this pattern:    [    a_{3} = 10t + 4 + 4 = 10t + 8    ]    [    a_{4} = 10t + 8 + 6 = 10(t+1) + 4     ]    - The sequence remains periodic modulo 20 with period 4 since (2+2+4+6=14) and so on every 4 steps, the additions sum up 4 mod 20 cycling through the same last digit. 3. **Finding powers of 2 in the sequence:**    We choose (j) such that (a_{j} equiv 2 pmod{10}) (i.e., the last digit of (a_j) is 2).     - If (a_j equiv 12 pmod{20}), then the numbers (a_{j + 4k} = a_j + 4k cdot 5 equiv 12 pmod{20}) for (k in mathbb{N}).    - Powers of 2 modulo 20 repeat every 4 terms as (12, 4, 8, 16, ldots), ensuring all numbers congruent to 2 modulo 20 eventually appear. 4. **Alternative idea in the general proof:**    Suppose (a_{j} = 4q) at some stage (as we always find terms divisible by 4 in the sequence).    - We solve (a_{j+4k} = a_j + 20k = 4(q + 5k))    - Finding (k) such that (2^m = a_{j + 4k}):      [      2^{m-2} = q + 5k quad text{with}  q in {1, 2, 3, 4} pmod{5}      ]      - Repeating cycles of 2 modulo 5, (2^{m-2} in {1, 2, 4, 3}) ensures solution for infinitely many (m). 5. **Conclusion:**    Hence, if (a_{1}) is not divisible by 5, the sequence contains infinitely many powers of 2.

The goal is to compare the values of a, b, and c defined respectively as f({sinfrac{{2π}}{7}}), f({cosfrac{{5π}}{7}}), and f({tanfrac{{5π}}{7}}). Let's proceed step by step: 1. **Transformation of cosfrac{5π}{7}**: Given cosfrac{{5π}}{7}=cos({frac{π}{2}+frac{{3π}}{{14}}}), we use the identity cos(x)=sin(frac{pi}{2}-x) to find an equivalent expression. However, in this case, we have cos(x) = -sin(x-frac{pi}{2}). So, cosfrac{{5π}}{7} = -sinfrac{{3π}}{{14}}. Since fleft(xright) is an even function (f(x) = f(-x)), we have: [b = f({-sinfrac{{3π}}{{14}}}) = f({sinfrac{{3π}}{{14}}})] 2. **Transformation of tanfrac{5π}{7}**: We know tan frac{5π}{7}=tan (π-frac{2π}{7}). Since tan(π-x) = -tan(x), it follows that tan frac{5π}{7}=-tan frac{2π}{7}. Again, as f(x) is an even function: [c = f(-tan frac{2π}{7}) = f(tan frac{2π}{7})] 3. **Comparing Values within 0 to frac{π}{2}**: In the interval ({0,frac{π}{2}}), y=sin x is monotonically increasing. Consequently, we can compare the values directly: [0 lt sinfrac{3π}{14} lt sinfrac{2π}{7} lt 1 lt tanfrac{2π}{7}] 4. **Application on f(x)=x^{2}**: The function fleft(xright)=x^{2} is even and monotonically increasing for x geq 0. Applying this to the comparisons derived above, we get: [f(0) lt f(sinfrac{3π}{14}) lt f(sinfrac{2π}{7}) lt f(1) lt f(tanfrac{2π}{7})] Therefore, substituting the respective values, we obtain: [b lt a lt c] Hence, the correct answer is: [boxed{D}]"},{"instruction":"ABCD is a regular tetrahedron.

As BCD is an equilateral triangle, G also serves as the centroid for triangle BCD. 2. **Properties of N:**    As N is the midpoint of overline{BC}, we consider G on the line segment connecting N and D since G is the centroid. This implies NG = frac{2}{3}NC and DG = frac{1}{3}ND given the property of centroids. 3. **Finding cos angle AND:**    We consider triangle AND with NG as the median. Since D is the apex of the tetrahedron, AN = ND due to the symmetry of the tetrahedron. Thus angle AND is split equally by NG.    Using the fact that G is frac{2}{3} along ND from N, we have:    [    cos angle AND = cos angle ANG = frac{NG}{AN} = frac{frac{2}{3}ND}{AN} = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{ND}{AN} = frac{2}{3}    ]    Considering AN = ND, the ratio becomes:    [    cos angle AND = boxed{frac{2}{3}}    ]"},{"instruction":"The equation ( x^2  kx + 15 = 0 ) has only integer solutions for certain positive integers ( k ).

Find the measure of angle A. 2. Find the maximum value of sin B + sin C.","output":"1. Given the equation 2asin A = (2b+c)sin B + (2c+b)sin C, we can utilize the Law of Sines, which states that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R, where R is the circumradius of the triangle. We can rewrite the aforementioned equation as follows:     2 cdot 2R cdot sin^2 A = (2 cdot 2R cdot sin B + 2R cdot sin C) sin B + (2 cdot 2R cdot sin C + 2R cdot sin B) sin C.    Simplifying by dividing both sides by 2R, we get:     4 sin^2 A = 4 sin B sin C + 2 sin^2 B + 4 sin B sin C + 2 sin^2 C.    The equation becomes:     sin^2 A = 2 sin B sin C + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = (sin B + sin C)^2 - 2sin B sin C.     Substituting sin^2 A with 1 - cos^2 A and simplifying, we get:     1 - cos^2 A = (sin B + sin C)^2 - sin B sin C.    Apply the Sine Rule again, and we have sin B + sin C = frac{b+c}{2R} and sin B sin C = frac{bc}{(2R)^2}:     1 - cos^2 A = left(frac{b+c}{2R}right)^2 - frac{bc}{(2R)^2}.    Simplifying further, we arrive at a relationship involving the sides of the triangle and the cosine of angle A:     cos^2 A = left(frac{b+c}{2R}right)^2 - 1 + frac{bc}{(2R)^2}.    This simplifies to:     cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 + 2bc - 4R^2}{4R^2}.    Using the Cosine Rule, cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}, we then compare the two expressions for cos A, and after simplifying further, we find 2bc - a^2 = -4R^2:     a^2 = 2bc + 4R^2.    Since a^2 is now obviously greater than 2bc, and it is known that the largest side of a triangle is opposite the largest angle, it implies that A must be the largest angle of the triangle. As 2R is always positive and we have bc + 4R^2 > bc, the only angle whose cosine can yield a negative result is one greater than 90° but less than 180°. Thus, we have A > 90° and A < 180°.    Now consider the function f(x) = sin x - frac{1}{2}cos x on the interval (90°,180°). Its derivative is f'(x) = cos x + frac{1}{2}sin x. Setting f'(x) = 0 to find the critical points, we get:     cos x + frac{1}{2}sin x = 0 implies tan x = -2.    The solution in the specified interval is x = 120°. To confirm that this gives a maximum, we examine the second derivative f''(x) = -sin x + frac{1}{2}cos x. Substituting x = 120° into the second derivative, we get f''(120°) < 0, indicating a local maximum. Therefore, A = 120°.    [boxed{A = 120°}] 2. To find the maximum value of sin B + sin C, we can use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of any two angles is less than 180°. Therefore, to maximize sin B + sin C, we want B and C to be as large as possible without exceeding 180° - A since A + B + C = 180°. Given A = 120°, we have B + C = 60°.    The maximum value occurs when B = C = 30°, as the function sin x increases in the interval (0°, 90°). Therefore:     sin B + sin C = sin 30° + sin 30° = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1.

Since the cubes are not touching any tin foil on any of their sides, they must be completely enclosed by other cubes that are covered in tin foil. This means the 128 cubes form a smaller rectangular prism within the larger prism. Let's denote the width, length, and height of the smaller prism as w, l, and h, respectively. The volume of the smaller prism is the product of these dimensions, which is equal to the number of cubes: w * l * h = 128 We are looking for whole number dimensions that multiply to 128. The prime factorization of 128 is 2^7, which means we can express 128 as a product of factors of 2. One way to divide 128 into three dimensions is to use the factors 2^4, 2^2, and 2^1, which are 16, 4, and 2, respectively. So, the dimensions of the smaller prism could be: w = 4 l = 16 h = 2 The ratio of the width to the length and height would then be: Width to Length: 4:16 or 1:4 Width to Height: 4:2 or 2:1 However, there could be other combinations of dimensions that also satisfy the condition w * l * h = 128.

Using similar triangles, because lines are drawn parallel, the segments on triangle PQR will similarly split triangle UVW. - Since lengths of SE=75, EY=35, YT=25 are given, the ratio of similar triangles is calculated by comparing these with the corresponding full side lengths of PQR.  - For line ell_P, intersects triangle PQR such that SE=35 and YT=75.  - Hence using similar triangles, we can compute the other segment lengths.

We substitute (x = -1) into (f(x)): [ f(-1) = (-1)^{10} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 ] Thus, the remainder when (x^{10} - 1) is divided by (x+1) is (0). **Using Polynomial Factorization Insight:** We know that (x^{10} - 1) can be factored as ((x^2 - 1)(x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)), and further factorize (x^2 - 1) as ((x - 1)(x + 1)). Since (x + 1) is a factor of (x^{10} - 1), (x^{10} - 1) is divisible by (x + 1), leaving a remainder of (0). Conclusion with boxed answer: The remainder when (x^{10} - 1) is divided by (x+1) is (0).

This plane is essentially the plane passing through the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron. 3. **Projection onto a plane perpendicular to (alpha):**    We aim to find a plane perpendicular to (alpha). When the tetrahedron is projected onto this plane, the projection will be a trapezoid. The height of this trapezoid is constant, so we only need to consider the sum of the projection lengths of the edges ( a = V_1V_2 ) and ( b = V_3V_4 ). 4. **Reduction to a 2-dimensional problem:**    The problem now reduces to a 2-dimensional space. For two given vectors ( mathbf{v}_1 ) and ( mathbf{v}_2 ), we need to find two lines ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ) such that the ratio of the sum of the projection lengths is no less than ( sqrt{2} ). 5. **Choosing the lines (ell_1) and (ell_2):**    Without loss of generality, assume ( |mathbf{v}_1| geq |mathbf{v}_2| ). Let ( ell_1 ) be perpendicular to ( mathbf{v}_1 ). The sum of the projection lengths onto ( ell_1 ) is no greater than ( |mathbf{v}_2| ). 6. **Projection onto (ell_2):**    Let ( ell_2 ) be parallel to ( mathbf{v}_1 pm mathbf{v}_2 ). The sum of the projection lengths onto ( ell_2 ) is at least ( |mathbf{v}_1 pm mathbf{v}_2| ). 7. **Using the Pythagorean identity:**    We use the identity:    [    |mathbf{v}_1 + mathbf{v}_2|^2 + |mathbf{v}_1 - mathbf{v}_2|^2 = 2(|mathbf{v}_1|^2 + |mathbf{v}_2|^2).    ]    Since ( |mathbf{v}_1| geq |mathbf{v}_2| ), we have:    [    2(|mathbf{v}_1|^2 + |mathbf{v}_2|^2) geq 4|mathbf{v}_2|^2.    ]    Therefore,    [    |mathbf{v}_1 + mathbf{v}_2|^2 + |mathbf{v}_1 - mathbf{v}_2|^2 geq 4|mathbf{v}_2|^2.    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    This implies that the sum of the projection lengths onto ( ell_2 ) is at least ( sqrt{2} ) times the sum of the projection lengths onto ( ell_1 ).

Let us denote the initial number on the board as (0). The two players will perform 1993 steps each. 2. The first player will always choose a sign and the second player will always choose a natural number from 1 to 1993, such that each number from 1 to 1993 is chosen exactly once. 3. At every turn, the absolute value of the arithmetic sum on the board increases by the chosen number with the determined sign. 4. We wish to find the largest guaranteed win for the second player, which is calculated as the maximum guaranteed value of the final sum's absolute value.     Strategy of the First Player: 5. The first player attempts to minimize the possible maximum guaranteed gain of the second player:     * On the first turn, the first player places a sign ((+) or (-)) opposite to the current sum's sign (assuming it is not zero; otherwise, any sign can be chosen).     * This ensures the first player keeps the sum of the board close to zero to the extent possible.  Optimal Strategy for the Second Player: 6. To demonstrate how the second player can guarantee getting a maximum of 1993, consider the following grouping tactic:     \`\`\`     Split the sequence of numbers from 1 to 1993 into two sequences where each sequence sums up equally (or as close to equally as possible).     \`\`\`     Specifically, we can group the numbers into two sets:     * Series 1: (1, 4, 5, 8, ldots, 4k-3, 4k, ldots, 1989, 1992)     * Series 2: (2, 3, 6, 7, ldots, 4k-2, 4k-1, ldots, 1990, 1991) 7. For every symbol (either (+) or (-)) assigned by the first player, the second player can distribute large numbers from one of these groups accordingly:     * If (+) sign is placed, choose from the first series.     * If (-) sign is placed, choose from the second series.  Calculation of Inclusion of the Highest Unused Value at Optimal Point: 8. Considering no symbol appears more than 996 times consecutively out of the first 1992 turns (as each series has 996 numbers each), the maximum sum is ensured by smartly using the last available number left, which is 1993. 9. After 996 additions and the same number of subtractions, the sum near zero persists, and we place the largest number, 1993, to guarantee its influence.  Conclusion: Thus, the maximum guaranteed win for the second player can be derived as follows: - Total contribution from either sequence in isolation when chosen optimally each step will ensure keeping the net effect of combinations manageable and applicable. - Ending with 1993 creates the maximal differential possible beyond the board’s average arithmetic maneuvering. The largest guaranteed win the second player can secure by absolute arithmetic strategy is thus: [ boxed{1993} ]"},{"instruction":"Construct a function ( f ) on the set of Martian amoebas ({A, B, C}) such that the following equalities hold:  f(A) oplus f(B)=f(C), quad f(A) oplus f(C)=f(B), quad f(B) oplus f(C)=f(A)","output":"1.

Substituting the known values, we get: (sqrt{3})^2 = a^2left(1 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2right) 3 = a^2left(frac{3}{4}right) a^2 = 4 So, a = 2 (as a > b > 0).

To show that the orthocenters lie on a common line, it suffices to show that ( H_1H_4 ) passes through ( P ). If ( H_1H_4 ) passes through ( P ), then by symmetry and the properties of the geometric arrangement, ( H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4, ) and ( P ) will lie on a common line. 5. Assume that triangle OAB and triangle OAD have conditions such that OB = OA = OD, and AP perp BD with ( P ) on ( BD ).

From the similarity of triangle H_1NT and triangle H_4MS, we obtain:    [    frac{MH_4}{AH_4} = frac{NH_1}{AH_1}.    ] 10.

What is the speed of the goods train in kmph?","output":"To find the speed of the goods train, we first need to determine the total distance it covers while crossing the platform. This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform. Length of the train = 280.04 meters Length of the platform = 240 meters Total distance covered = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance covered = 280.04 meters + 240 meters Total distance covered = 520.04 meters The train covers this distance in 26 seconds. To find the speed in meters per second (m/s), we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 520.04 meters / 26 seconds Speed ≈ 20 m/s To convert this speed to kilometers per hour (km/h), we use the conversion factor: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h Speed in km/h = Speed in m/s * 3.6 Speed in km/h ≈ 20 m/s * 3.6 Speed in km/h ≈ 72 km/h Therefore, the speed of the goods train is approximately boxed{72}  kilometers per hour (km/h)."},{"instruction":"Paco uses a spinner to select a number from 1 through 6, each with equal probability.

Represent the repeating decimal (a = 0.365365cdots 365 cdots) as a fraction. # Detailed Solution:  1. **Density of Repeating Decimals in (0,1):** Let ((a, b) subseteq (0,1)). Recall (a = 0.a_1a_2cdots a_ncdots) and (b = 0.b_1b_2cdots b_ncdots), such that (a < b). 1. Let (k) be the first position where (a_k neq b_k). Since (a < b), there exist such ( k ) and we have (a_k < b_k). 2. If there exists an (m>k) such that (b_m neq 0), define the decimal (c) as follows:    - (c_i = b_i) for (0 leq i < m),    - (c_m = 0),    - (c_i = 1) for (i > m).     This results in (c = 0.c_1c_2cdots c_m000cdots 000111cdots 111cdots), which is a repeating decimal, and clearly, (a < c < b). 3. If for all (m > k), (b_m = 0), then there must exist some (m) where (a_m neq 9). Define (c) as follows:    - (c_i = a_i) for (0 leq i < m),    - (c_m = a_m + 1),    - (c_i = 0) for (i > m).     This results in (c = 0.c_1c_2cdots c_m000cdots 000000cdots), which is again a repeating decimal, and (a < c < b). This shows that between any two distinct decimals (a) and (b) in the interval ((0,1)), there is always a repeating decimal (c). Hence, repeating decimals are dense in ((0,1)).

This number (c) differs from each (alpha_i) in the (i)-th digit, meaning (c) is not in the sequence (alpha_1, alpha_2, cdots). Thus, the assumption that ((0,1]) can be enumerated is false, meaning ((0,1]) is uncountable.

(ii) Finding the germination rate of seeds for each plot The germination rate of seeds for each plot, considering the probabilities of planting each vegetable and their respective emergence rates, is calculated as follows: P = frac{1}{3} times 0.95 + frac{2}{3} times 0.98 Performing the multiplication and addition: P = 0.3167 + 0.6533 = 0.97 Thus, the germination rate of seeds for each plot is boxed{0.97}. # Part 2 Given that in each column there is a plot planting eggplants, we need to find the distribution table and the expected value of X, the number of rows planting cucumbers.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) For Set A: Sum_A = 66/2 * (10 + 75) Sum_A = 33 * 85 Sum_A = 2805 Set B contains all the even and odd numbers between 76 and 125 inclusive. This is also an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 76, the last term a_n = 125, and the common difference d = 1. The number of terms n in the sequence can be found in the same way: 125 = 76 + (n - 1)1 125 = 76 + n - 1 n = 125 - 76 + 1 n = 50 So, there are 50 terms in Set B. The sum of Set B: Sum_B = 50/2 * (76 + 125) Sum_B = 25 * 201 Sum_B = 5025 Now, we can find the difference between the sum of the elements of Set B and the sum of the elements of Set A: Difference = Sum_B - Sum_A Difference = 5025 - 2805 Difference = 2220 Therefore, the difference between the sum of the elements of Set B and the sum of the elements of Set A is boxed{2220} ."},{"instruction":"An Indian engineer thought of a natural number, wrote down all its proper natural divisors, and then increased each of these listed numbers by 1.

Recall that a divisor is called proper if it is not equal to 1 and does not coincide with the number itself.","output":"1. **Define variables and start analysis**:        Let the original number be ( n ). The others ( m ) is defined as “the other number” indicated in the problem. It states that the ( m ) must be odd because ( m )'s divisors have been transformed such that any even number could never transform into another even number in the process described (since one of the original odd divisors would transform into an even number by adding 1).         Hence, ( m ) must be odd. 2. **Consider divisors and transformations**:        If all the divisors of ( n ) transformed into odd numbers by adding 1, then all the divisors of ( m ) are odd.        The divisors of ( n ) therefore must all be even. Therefore, ( n ) must be a power of 2. 3. **Testing powers of 2**:        Let's check each power of 2 to determine if it fits:    - **For ( n = 4 )**:      [      text{Divisors of } 4: 1, 2, 4      ]      Removing 1 and 4 (since they do not transform), we get:      [      Rightarrow 2 + 1 = 3      ]      So, the new divisors are 3 (after removing 1 and adding 1 to remaining).

Therefore, (a_{2k+1}) must be negative:       [       sum_{1 leq i leq 39, i neq 2k+1} a_i > 0 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{39} a_i < 0 Rightarrow a_{2k+1} < 0       ] 5. **Even Numbers**:     - Since (a_{2k+1} < 0) and (a_{2k} + a_{2k+1} > 0), it follows that:       [       a_{2k} > -a_{2k+1} > 0       ]     - This proves that (a_{2k}) is positive. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Since there are 20 odd positions and 19 even positions, we will have 20 negative numbers and 19 positive numbers.     - The product of an even number of negative numbers (20 negatives) and any number of positive numbers will always be positive.

This means if the argument of the logarithm b is less than a (keeping in mind that 0 < b < 1), then log_a b < 1, which would satisfy the given inequality directly due to the properties of logarithms.

The equation of a line in intercept form is:      [      frac{x}{c} + frac{y}{frac{1}{c}} = 1      ]      Simplifying:      [      frac{x}{c} + cy = 1 implies y = frac{1}{c}left(1 - frac{x}{c}right)      ] 4. **Combining All Parts of the Density Function:**    On the entire real line mathbb{R}, the density function f(x) can thus be written as:    [    f(x) =     begin{cases}     0 & text{if } x < -c     frac{1}{c}left(1 + frac{x}{c}right) & text{if } -c le x < 0     frac{1}{c}left(1 - frac{x}{c}right) & text{if } 0 le x le c     0 & text{if } x > c     end{cases}    ]        Alternatively, it can be rewritten in a more compact form:    [    f(x) =     begin{cases}     frac{1}{c}left(1 - frac{|x|}{c}right) & text{if } -c le x le c     0 & text{otherwise}    end{cases}    ]  Part (b) Finding the Probability (P(c/2 < X < c)): 1. **Setting Up the Integral:**    The probability that the random variable X falls within the interval (c/2, c) is given by integrating the density function f(x) over this interval:    [    Pleft(frac{c}{2} < X < cright) = int_{frac{c}{2}}^c f(x) , dx    ] 2. **Integrating f(x) Over the Interval:**        Over (frac{c}{2}, c), the relevant part of the density function is:    [    f(x) = frac{1}{c}left(1 - frac{x}{c}right)    ]        Therefore, we compute:    [    int_{frac{c}{2}}^c frac{1}{c}left(1 - frac{x}{c}right) , dx     ]        - **First Compute the Integral:**      [      int_{frac{c}{2}}^c frac{1}{c} - frac{x}{c^2} , dx      ]            This can be broken down into two separate integrals:      [      int_{frac{c}{2}}^c frac{1}{c} , dx - int_{frac{c}{2}}^c frac{x}{c^2} , dx      ]    - **Solve Each Integral:**      [      int_{frac{c}{2}}^c frac{1}{c} , dx = frac{1}{c} left[ x right]_{frac{c}{2}}^c = frac{1}{c} left( c - frac{c}{2} right) = frac{1}{c} cdot frac{c}{2} = frac{1}{2}      ]      [      int_{frac{c}{2}}^c frac{x}{c^2} , dx = frac{1}{c^2} left[ frac{x^2}{2} right]_{frac{c}{2}}^c = frac{1}{c^2} left( frac{c^2}{2} - frac{left(frac{c}{2}right)^2}{2} right) = frac{1}{c^2} left( frac{c^2}{2} - frac{c^2}{8} right) = frac{1}{c^2} cdot frac{3c^2}{8} = frac{3}{8}      ] 3. **Putting It All Together:**        Subtract the two solutions:    [    Pleft(frac{c}{2} < X < cright) = frac{1}{2} - frac{3}{8} = frac{4}{8} - frac{3}{8} = frac{1}{8}    ]  Conclusion: The answers to the problem are: (a) The density function (f(x)): [ f(x) =  begin{cases}  frac{1}{c}left(1 - frac{|x|}{c}right) & text{if } -c le x le c  0 & text{otherwise} end{cases} ] (b) The probability that X lies in the interval left( frac{c}{2}, c right): [ Pleft( frac{c}{2} < X < c right) = frac{1}{8} ] [ boxed{frac{1}{8}} ]"},{"instruction":"Simplify [ frac{cx(a^2x^2 + 3a^2y^2 + c^2z^2) + bz(a^2x^2 + 3c^2x^2 + c^2y^2)}{cx + bz} ] A. a^2x^2 + c^2y^2 + c^2z^2 B.

The angles of a triangle must sum up to 180°, and given ∠B=60°, we consider the restrictions on A to ensure a valid triangle. This leads to two possibilities: 0^{circ} < Aleqslant 60^{circ}, which ensures A and B are not too large to allow for a third angle, or A=90^{circ}, which would make the triangle a right-angled triangle. 3. **Implications for sin A**:    From the possibilities for A, we deduce:    - If 0^{circ} < Aleqslant 60^{circ}, then 0 < sin Aleqslant frac{sqrt{3}}{2} since sin 60° = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.    - If A=90^{circ}, then sin A=1 since sin 90° = 1. 4. **Conclusion for the Range of a**:    Combining these results, we have 0 < a leqslant sqrt{3} when 0^{circ} < Aleqslant 60^{circ} and a = 2 when A = 90^{circ}, since a = 2sin A translates the sin A values directly to a.

Let's delve into the solution step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the Euclidean Algorithm:**    The Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers by repeatedly applying the operation:    [    text{GCD}(a, b) = text{GCD}(b, a mod b)    ]    until ( b ) becomes zero. 2. **Lemma - Properties of Fibonacci Numbers:**    In the worst-case scenario, the Euclidean algorithm takes the maximum number of steps when applied to consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

We are given that we can assemble multiple (A) rectangles to form a rectangle (P) similar to (B). That is, the dimensions of (P) can be written as:    [    P = (p a_1 + q a_2) times (r a_1 + s a_2)    ]    where (p, q, r, s) are some integers. 2. **Rationality of Aspect Ratio:**      Assume first that the aspect ratio ( frac{a_1}{a_2} ) is rational. Then the aspect ratio ( frac{b_1}{b_2} ) of the similar rectangle (B) (constructed from rectangle (A)) will also be rational. Consequently, we can arrange rectangles (B) to form a square, and from such squares, we can form a rectangle similar to (A). 3. **Irrational Aspect Ratio:**      Now, consider the case where the aspect ratio ( frac{a_1}{a_2} ) is irrational. Suppose any number can be expressed as (z a_1 + t a_2), where (z) and (t) are integers. This implies that if (z a_1 + t a_2 = Z a_1 + T a_2) then:    [    (z - Z) a_1 = (t - T) a_2    ]    Since the ratio is irrational, (z = Z) and (t = T). Therefore, the coefficients (z) and (t) are determined uniquely. 4. **Horizontal and Vertical Arrangement of Bricks:**      Assume we start with a horizontal brick of width (a_1) at the bottom left corner. We extend the right side of this brick to form the longest possible segment, taking into account (a_1) units along the x-axis and (a_2) units along the y-axis.    By continuing in this manner, we find that each added segment arranges precisely along the similar rectangles, ensuring the proportional arrangement follows the irrational aspect ratio constraints. 5. **Proportionality and Formation of Rectangle Similar to (A):**    As determined in the horizontal step, since the ratio ( frac{a_1}{a_2} ) is irrational, and continuing to align bricks in a systematic fashion, it ensures no overlaps and perfect fitting extending horizontally and vertically. 6. **Conclusion:**      Since we have constructed segments proportional to the aspects of (A) using bricks of dimensions equivalent to (B), ensuring both horizontal and vertical proportions, we affirm a similar rectangle to (A) can be constructed from (B). # Final Answer:     Therefore, it is proven that from rectangles equal to (B), we can construct a rectangle similar to (A).

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Equal Angles**:     - Since K and L are chosen such that angle ABK = angle ADL, triangles ABK and ADL share an angle. 2. **Similarity of Triangles**:     - Considering angle BAC = angle BDA, we note that triangle ABE sim triangle LDA because AE and LA subtend angles at D and B respectively, making:      frac{AE}{LA} = frac{BE}{DA}  3. **Proportions**:     - Given that AD = BC, from the similarity of triangles, we have:      frac{AE}{BE} = frac{AL}{BC}  4. **Angle Consideration**:     - The subtended angles EAL and EBC must be equal because angle EAL = angle EBC. 5. **Similar Triangles**:     - Hence, triangle AEL sim triangle BEC, leading to:      angle AEF = angle BEC      - Similarly:      angle AEB = angle CEF  6. **Parallel Lines**:     - We know angle ACB = angle AEB = angle CEF = angle CB F.     - Since alternate interior angles are equal, it must be that BF parallel AC.

We encounter configuration issues due to the geometry and parity of cells in a 2 times 1 arrangement.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step: 1. **Suppose by contradiction:**    Assume that there are more than ( n ) pairs of points that are the maximum distance, let's denote this maximum distance by ( d ). We will prove that this assumption leads to a contradiction. 2. **Key Geometric Observation:**    The essential geometric observation is that if two segments of length ( d ) do not intersect, then we can find an endpoint of one segment which is at a distance greater than ( d ) from an endpoint of the other segment. This implies that such arrangements are geometrically incompatible with the segments being the longest. 3. **Induction Basis:**    Let’s start the induction process with ( n = 2 ) points. Clearly, with ( n = 2 ), there’s exactly one pair, and hence at most ( n = 2 ) can hold the maximum distance property. So the base case holds true. 4. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that the statement is true for some ( n = k ). That is, for ( n = k ) points, at most ( k ) pairs are the maximum distance apart. 5. **Inductive Step:**    Now extend this to ( n = k + 1 ). If there were more than ( k + 1 ) pairs among ( k + 1 ) points that are the maximum distance ( d ), consider any point ( A ) which appears in more than two segments of length ( d ). Specifically assume ( A ) is part of maximum distance pairs ( AB, AC, ) and ( AD ). 6. **Arranging Points:**    Choose points ( B, C, ) and ( D ) such that point ( C ) lies geographically between ( B ) and ( D ) when observed from ( A ). 7. **Contradiction Visualization:**    Observe that once we fix ( C ) at this intermediate position relative to ( B ) and ( D ), point ( C ) cannot participate in any other segment of length ( d ).     - Suppose ( C ) is involved in a new segment ( CX ), then this segment must cut across both ( AB ) and ( AD ), creating distances where distances would exceed ( d ). This is geometrically impossible.    To better understand this contradiction, let’s examine ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ACD ). If      8. **Proof about Acute Angles:**    For the segments ( PQ ) and ( RS ) (with lengths ( d )):    - The angles ( angle PQR ), ( angle PQS ), ( angle QRS ) and ( angle RSP ) would all need to be less than 90°, which would ensure the diagonals of any such quadrilateral formed would exceed length ( d ), proving itself impossible. 9. **Conclusion of Induction:**    Therefore, the assumption that there are more than ( n ) pairs as maximum is false, thereby affirming that for ( n = k + 1 ), the maximum distance pairs can indeed be at most ( k + 1 ). Hence, by the principle of mathematical induction, for any number ( n > 2 ) of points, the number of pairs of points that are at the maximum distance apart is at most ( n ).

Since the building is farther than 1 km, there is an extra delivery charge of 2 dollars. The cost of 1 pizza is 12 dollars, so 2 pizzas would cost 2 * 12 = 24 dollars. The delivery charge for the building 2 km away is 2 dollars, so the total cost for this delivery is 24 + 2 = 26 dollars.

We are asked to find the value of f(log_23). First, we need to determine the range of log_23, and then apply the appropriate part of the piecewise function. Step 1: Since 1 < log_23 < 2, we start with the part of the function where x < 4, which gives us f(log_23) = f(log_23 + 1). Step 2: Continuing this process, we find that 4 < log_23 + 3 < 5, which allows us to use the part of the function where x geq 4. So, we have f(log_23 + 3) = 2^{log_23 + 3}.

Consider the cube (ABCDA'B'C'D'), where ( alpha ) is a plane perpendicular to the space diagonal ( AC' ) of the cube. The plane ( alpha ) intersects the cube in such a way that it forms a polygon ( W ).     2. By slicing the cube by the plane ( alpha ) through perpendicular lines, the sections intersecting ( alpha ) form regions that cut through each face of the cube, including faces parallel to ( ABCD ) and ( A'B'C'D' ). 3. When the cube is sliced by ( alpha ) through the diagonal ( AC' ), the intersection polygon is symmetrical due to the perpendicularity and symmetrical properties of the cube. 4. The intersection forms hexagons and other polygons depending on the exact cut of the plane ( alpha ). 5. Common properties of these polygons ( W ) are:     - Every polygonal edge in ( W ) aligns parallel to an edge from the cube.    - The polygons can range from regular hexagons in some positions to triangles in others. 6. Since the plane ( alpha ) intersects the cube uniformly cutting through each face, the edge alignment with cube edges means the perimeter ( l ) of any such polygon ( W ) formed at such an intersection remains constant irrespective of the position of ( alpha ). 7. However, the area ( S ) of the intersection polygon depends on its specific shape:    - For example, when ( E' ) (a representative point on ( alpha )’s intersection with face ( A'B'C'D' )) is positioned at different points, ( W ) can transition between a hexagon and a triangle.    - A regular hexagon cut from such a plane has an area ( S = frac{sqrt{3}}{24} l^2 ), whereas a triangle would have ( S = frac{sqrt{3}}{36} l^2 ).

So, for those 6 days, he consumes: 6 days * 2500 calories/day = 15000 calories On Saturday, he consumes an extra 1000 calories, so for Saturday: 2500 calories/day + 1000 calories = 3500 calories Now, let's add the calories for the entire week: 15000 calories (Sunday to Friday) + 3500 calories (Saturday) = 18500 calories/week Jonathan has a weekly caloric deficit of 2500 calories. This means that he burns 2500 calories more than he consumes over the course of a week.

However, since we are looking for the probability of drawing one card from each suit, the first card's suit does not matter. It sets the stage for the suits we are looking to complete in the subsequent draws. 2. **Second Card Drawn**: After the first card is drawn and replaced, we need the second card to be from a different suit. The probability of this happening is frac{39}{52} (since 39 out of the 52 cards belong to the other three suits), which simplifies to frac{3}{4}. 3. **Third Card Drawn**: After replacing the second card, we now have two specific suits we've drawn from and two we haven't. The probability that the third card is from a new suit, not matching the first two, is frac{26}{52} (26 cards belong to the two suits not yet drawn), which simplifies to frac{1}{2}. 4. **Fourth Card Drawn**: Finally, after replacing the third card, we aim to draw a card from the last remaining suit. The probability of this is frac{13}{52}, as 13 cards belong to the last suit we haven't drawn from yet, simplifying to frac{1}{4}. Combining these probabilities, we calculate the overall probability of drawing one card from each suit in four draws with replacement as follows: [ frac{3}{4} cdot frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{32} ] Therefore, the probability of ending up with one card from each suit when four cards are drawn with replacement from a standard 52-card deck is boxed{frac{3}{32}}."},{"instruction":"A prism has 27 edges.

Thus, (K_a) and (K_b) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of (O P). As a result, (O K_a P K_b = N) forms a symmetric deltoid along the perpendicular bisector (f), and the angles (K_a O K_b ) and (K_a P K_b) are equal.

Part (a) The sequence given is such that each digit, starting from the fifth, equals the last digit of the sum of the preceding four digits. We need to determine if the sequence 1234 will ever appear consecutively. 1. Observe the parity of the last digit of sums modulo 2, as the last digit of a sum of four digits (0-9) will be influenced by their parity (even or odd).     2. Represent the initial sequence 1975 and analyze:    - (1) is odd (n),    - (9) is odd (n),    - (7) is odd (n),    - (5) is odd (n). 3. Calculate the parity of the next digit using the rule:    - Sum of 1 (n) + 9 (n) + 7 (n) + 5 (n) = 22 (even) → 2 (ch, even) 4. Continue this logic to identify the pattern:    - The next sums will be processed similarly:      - New sum = 9 (n) + 7 (n) + 5 (n) + 2 (ch) = 23 (odd)      - New sum = 7 (n) + 5 (n) + 2 (ch) + 3 (n) = 17 (odd)      - New sum = 5 (n) + 2 (ch) + 3 (n) + 7 (n) = 17 (odd)        - New sum = 2 (ch) + 3 (n) + 7 (n) + 1 (n) = 13 (odd)      - New sum = 3 (n) + 7 (n) + 1 (n) + 1 (n) = 12 (even).  5. The patterns of the parities then will be periodic, as the process inherently repeats after a while. Thus:    - Each new cycle will be periodic: nnnnch, with n being odd and ch being even, leading to a cycle repeat after every set of computations, forming the sequence. 6.

There are (10^4) possible four-digit sequences because each digit can be (0ldots9) resulting in (10^4) combinations for four digits.     2. In a long enough sequence of digits, pigeonhole principle dictates that some 4-digit sequences will repeat due to finite combinations. 3. Check for 1975 specifically:    - Each cycle repeats by the observed pattern above, based on the sum of four prior digits. 4. In (1975 cdots), as described in formation:    - There will be a cycle because the inherent mathematical programming of digit sums will enforce periodic occurrences. 5. Since each time window of sums defines a periodicity, 1975 will repeat as being deterministically constrained by initial input and cyclicality.

Solution 1. Denote the three robbers as (A), (B), and (C). 2. Initially, robbers (A) and (B) divide the loot among themselves in the manner described in the problem statement, which ensures each obtains at least half of the loot:     - Suppose (A) divides the loot into two parts (A_1) and (A_2) such that (A_1 cup A_2 = text{total loot}).     - (B) then chooses the part they prefer. 3. Each of (A) and (B) now divides their respective obtained portions into three equal parts:     - Let (A_*) be the portion chosen by (A).     - (A_*) is divided into three parts (A_{1}^{A}), (A_{2}^{A}), and (A_{3}^{A}).     - Similarly, let (B_*) be the portion chosen by (B).     - (B_*) is divided into three parts (B_{1}^{B}), (B_{2}^{B}), and (B_{3}^{B}). 4. Robber (C) then selects one part from (A_* cup B_*), ensuring they get at least ( frac{1}{3} ) of each part they select. 5. This guarantees that:     - Robber (A) turns the part they own (A_*) into three parts, and (C) selects one of those, hence (A) gets at least ( frac{2}{3} ) of half the loot, which is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total loot.     - Similarly, (B) obtains at least ( frac{2}{3} ) of half the loot, which is also ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total loot.     - Robber (C) chooses a third from each part (A_*) and (B_*), together amounting to at least ( frac{2}{3} ) of the total loot. Each third of ( frac{2}{3} ) results in ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total loot.  II. Solution 1. Robber (A) divides the loot into three parts (P_1, P_2,) and (P_3). 2. Robber (B) then assigns these parts, giving one part each to (A, B,) and (C). 3. Robber (C) has three options:     - (a) Accept the given part.     - (b) Demand (A) for an exchange.     - (c) Propose a redivision with (B) of their mutual parts. 4. This ensures:     - (A) ensures one part for themselves.     - (B) can assign a minimal part to (A) and keep or assign a preferred part to themselves.     - (C) either accepts the assigned part, demands an exchange getting a fair share, or redistributes to still get at least ( frac{1}{3} ) of the remaining parts.  III. Solution 1. Robber (A) first marks out a single share. 2. (B) decides to take it or not:     - If (B) takes, (C) gets the remainder if they accept, or it falls back to (A). 3. Remaining robbers divide the rest equally, ensuring each gets at least ( frac{1}{3} ).  IV. Solution 1. Robber (A) splits the loot into three parts. 2. Robbers (B) and (C) then independently mark two of these parts. 3. Outcomes:     - If both mark the same two parts, they split these two among themselves, and (A) takes the third part.     - If one common part is marked, split it between (B) and (C), and each takes their marked part, sharing with (A) when necessary. **Conclusion:** Each division strategy ensures that every robber (A, B, C) gets at least ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total loot.

Does Bob have a winning strategy?","output":"To determine whether Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the possible moves and configurations in the game. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. **Definitions and Terminology**:     - Define a *LL-corner*: For any two unit edges sharing a common vertex, if the common vertex is at the lower left corner of a 2x2 unit square, we call these edges a \\"LL-corner.\\"     - Define a *UR-corner*: Similarly, if the common vertex is at the upper right corner of a 2x2 unit square, we call these edges a \\"UR-corner.\\"     - *Midline*: A consistent straight line direction is chosen in the grid. We refer to a unit edge on this line as a \\"midline.\\"     - *Left-side Unit Edge*: A unit edge immediately to the left of the midline.     - *Right-side Unit Edge*: A unit edge immediately to the right of the midline. 2. **Anna's Strategy**:     - Anna starts by choosing an arbitrary unit edge on the midline and defines its direction (the direction is arbitrary).     - Anna then observes Bob's move. Suppose Bob chooses a unit edge s to define its direction. 3. **Anna's Response**:     - If s lies on the midline, Anna continues to choose another unit edge on the midline and defines its direction arbitrarily.     - If s is not on the midline, Anna chooses the other unit edge t in the same corner as s and defines its direction such that s and t cannot form a loop (cycle). 4. **Preventing Bob's Victory**:     - Anna's moves ensure that she always responds in such a way that no cycle is formed. Specifically, if an edge from a LL-corner or UR-corner is oriented, Anna ensures that the opposite edge is oriented such that it avoids forming a cycle.      - Since Anna only needs to worry about unit edges in pairs (one from a LL-corner, one from a UR-corner), she can perpetually make moves that counter Bob's without fail. 5. **Conclusion**:     - If a cycle somehow forms, examine the vertices at the extremities of this cycle.         - If vertex X is at the lower-left and falls under LL-corner, it leads to a contradiction.         - If vertex Y is at the upper-right and falls under UR-corner, it again leads to a contradiction.     - Thus, the assumption of a cycle forming leads to contradictions in both cases, implying Anna's strategy effectively prevents Bob from ever completing a loop. # Conclusion: Therefore, **Bob does not have a winning strategy**, as Anna can always block his attempts to form a cycle by following the strategy described.

Begin with the first condition:     - For 甲 to be equidistant from 乙 and 丙, 甲 must be exactly in the middle of 乙 and 丙. In a linear seating arrangement, this implies that the possible positions for 乙, 甲, and 丙 are:        [       text{(乙, 甲, 丙)}       ]       or the reverse:       [       text{(丙, 甲, 乙)}       ] 3. Next, let's consider the second condition:     - 丁 must be positioned such that she is equidistant from 甲 and 丙. Given that we already have the possible setups for 乙 and 丙 around 甲, 丁 must be placed symmetrically around 甲 and 丙.

Now, let's incorporate the third condition:     - 戊 has both of her sisters seated right next to her. Since there are five seats, and only one possible pair of persons can fit this arrangement, 戊 must be placed between 乙 and 甲 because this is the only setup allowing two persons next to 戊 while satisfying their specific conditions. This gives us:       [       text{(乙, 戊, 甲, 丁, 丙)}       ]       or the reverse:       [       text{(丙, 戊, 甲, 丁, 乙)}       ] 5.

We need this sum to be just under or equal to 100 to find the correct group.  Solving frac{k(k+1)}{2} leq 100 gives us k leq 13. Thus, the total number of terms up to the 13th group is 1+2+3+...+13 = 91. This means the 100th term is in the 14th group and is the 9th term of that group, which is 2^{8}. Therefore, the 100th term of the sequence is 2^{8} = 256. So, the answer to part (1) is boxed{256}. **Part (2): Finding the Smallest Integer N > 1000** For the sum of the first N terms to be a power of 2, we consider the sum of the groups. The sum of the first k groups is a geometric series, which can be summed as 2^{0} + 2^{1} + ... + 2^{k-1} = 2^{k} - 1. The total sum up to the kth group then becomes 2^{1} - 1 + 2^{2} - 1 + ... + 2^{k} - 1 = (2^{1} + 2^{2} + ... + 2^{k}) - k = 2^{k+1} - k - 2. Given N > 1000, we find the minimum k such that frac{k(k+1)}{2} > 1000, which gives k geq 45. For the sum to be a power of 2, 2^{m} - 1 (the sum of the first m terms in the k+1 group) must make the total sum a power of 2. This implies 2^{m} - 1 = k + 2, or k = 2^{m} - 3. With k geq 44, we find m geq 6. Taking the minimum value of m = 6, we get k = 2^{6} - 3 = 61. The smallest N satisfying the condition is then found by adding 6 (for the terms in the 62nd group) to the total number of terms up to the 61st group, which is frac{61(61+1)}{2} + 6 = 1897.

The translation vector can be found by subtracting the coordinates of A from B, which gives us a vector of (-5,-4). Applying this translation to point C, we get the new coordinates of C' as (6-m,1-m). 2. **Setting up the equation based on the translation:** The translation implies that the change in the y-coordinate of point C due to the translation is equal to the change in the y-coordinate from A to B.

We need to demonstrate that among the 51 points, there exist at least three points that can be covered by a circle with a radius of ( frac{1}{7} ).    First, we divide the given square into smaller squares. Specifically, we divide the large square into 25 smaller squares, each with a side length of ( 0.2 ).    Since ( 1 = 5 times 0.2 ), we have ( 5 ) smaller squares along each side, giving us a total of ( 25 ) smaller squares. 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:**    With 51 points distributed among these 25 smaller squares, we apply the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item.    Here, we have 51 points (items) and 25 smaller squares (containers).

A set of natural numbers is considered \\"bad\\" if it is possible to choose several numbers from it such that their sum is 2012. 2. We are given a reference solution that suggests ( n = 2 ). To prove this, we need to demonstrate that the given range of numbers can be divided into two subsets in a way that ensures neither subset is bad. 3. Let's define the subsets as follows:     [ M_1 = {503, 504, ldots, 671} ]     [ M_2 = {672, 673, ldots, 1006} ]     [ M_3 = {1007, 1008, ldots, 1340} ]     [ M_4 = {1341, 1342, ldots, 2011} ] 4. We need to show that the sets ( M_1 cup M_3 ) and ( M_2 cup M_4 ) are not bad. 5.

Therefore, ( M_1 cup M_3 ) is not bad. 7. Next, we consider ( M_2 cup M_4 ):     - Any four numbers from ( M_2 ) will have a sum of at least:       [ 672 + 673 + 674 + 675 = 2694 > 2012 ]     - Any three numbers from ( M_2 ) will have a sum of at most:       [ 1004 + 1005 + 1006 = 3094 < 2012 ]     - Any two numbers from ( M_2 ) and one from ( M_4 ) will have a sum of at least:       [ 672 + 673 + 1341 = 2694 > 2012 ]     - Any one number from ( M_2 ) and one from ( M_4 ) will have a sum of at most:       [ 1006 + 2011 = 3017 < 2012 ]     - Any two numbers from ( M_4 ) will have a sum of at least:       [ 1341 + 1342 + 1341 = 4024 > 2012 ] 8.

We can make N-1 pieces with lengths of (1 , text{cm}) and one piece of (201-N , text{cm}). This yields the set of stick lengths: ({1, 1, ldots, 1, 201-N}).    The lengths of the sides of a rectangle cannot exceed half the perimeter, which is (1 , text{meter} = 100 , text{cm}). Thus, any side must be less than (100 , text{cm}). Since (201 - N geq 100) under (N leq 101), the piece of length (201 - N) cannot be part of any side of the rectangle.

Let (A_k) and (A_l) be such sums with (k < l). Then:    [    A_l - A_k = 99 = a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} + ldots + a_l.    ]    This process isolates several pieces summing to (99 , text{cm}), and the leftover pieces also sum to (99 , text{cm}). Thus, forming a rectangle of (1 times 99 , text{cm}).    **Second Method:**    Arrange the 102 pieces along a 200-unit circular perimeter, dividing them at each break point (indicated by (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{102})).    - These points are vertices of a 200-sided polygon (T).    - Grouping vertices into pairs (102 red points), find two pairs of diametrically opposite vertices.    Therefore:    - Circle segmentations yield (A) and (C) sides or (B) and (D) with equal lengths, ensuring construction of a rectangle from equal-length groups.    **Third Method:**    If (l) is the maximum stick length, and (x) is the number of (1 , text{cm}) pieces, there are (101 - x) pieces at least (2 , text{cm}) long:    The inequalities hold:    [    l + x + 2(101-x) leq 200 Rightarrow x geq l + 2.    ]    - Set two pieces of (1 , text{cm}) for two sides and fit lengths in decreasing order up to (99 , text{cm}).

An equal number of clownfish join them, so C - (B - 26) clownfish are initially in the display tank. However, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. Therefore, the number of clownfish that remain in the display tank is 2/3 of the number that initially joined the blowfish, which is 2/3 * (C - (B - 26)). Since C = B, we can substitute B for C in the equation: Number of clownfish in the display tank = 2/3 * (B - (B - 26)) = 2/3 * (B - B + 26) = 2/3 * 26 = 52/3 = 17.333... Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-evaluate our steps to ensure we haven't made a mistake.

This can be achieved if the common ratio r is negative because it will cause the sign of the terms to alternate. 3. **Monotonically Decreasing Absolute Values**: For the absolute values of the terms to be monotonically decreasing, the absolute value of the common ratio |r| must be less than 1 but greater than 0 (0 < |r| < 1).

To save construction costs and ensure timely completion, which plan do you think should be chosen? Please explain your reasoning.","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the cost and time implications of each plan. Let's denote the standard completion time for the project as x days. # Step 1: Establish the Equation For Plan (C), where both teams work together for 3 days and then Team B completes the work alone, the fraction of work done by both teams in 3 days plus the fraction of work done by Team B in x days (since it finishes on time) should equal the whole project. This can be represented as: [ frac{3}{x} + frac{x}{x + 4} = 1 ] # Step 2: Solve the Equation Solving the equation for x, we proceed as follows: [ frac{3}{x} + frac{x}{x + 4} = 1 implies 3(x + 4) + x^2 = x(x + 4) ] [ 3x + 12 + x^2 = x^2 + 4x ] [ 3x - 4x + 12 = 0 ] [ -x + 12 = 0 implies x = 12 ] After checking, we find that x = 12 is a valid solution and satisfies the conditions of the problem. # Step 3: Calculate the Time for Team B Alone Given that x = 12, for Team B to complete the project alone, it would take x + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16 days. # Step 4: Compare the Costs - For Plan (A), where Team A completes the project alone in 12 days, the cost is 12 times 10,000 yuan. - For Plan (C), the cost is the sum of 3 days of both teams working together plus the remaining days with Team B working alone. This translates to 3 times (10,000 + 6,000) + 12 times 6,000 yuan. Calculating the costs: - Plan (A): 12 times 10,000 = 120,000 yuan. - Plan (C): 3 times 16,000 + 12 times 6,000 = 48,000 + 72,000 = 120,000 yuan. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation for Plan (C). Let's correct this: For Plan (C), the cost should be calculated for 3 days of work by both teams and then the remaining work by Team B alone, considering the total days required for Team B to complete the project is 16 days, not 12. The correct calculation should be: - 3 days of work by both teams: 3 times (10,000 + 6,000) = 48,000 yuan. - Remaining work by Team B alone for 13 days (since 16 - 3 = 13): 13 times 6,000 = 78,000 yuan. - Total cost for Plan (C): 48,000 + 78,000 = 126,000 yuan. Given this correction, the comparison of costs should be revisited. The corrected costs are: - Plan (A): 120,000 yuan. - Plan (C): 126,000 yuan.

However, based on the initial problem statement and solution provided, the intention was to demonstrate a method for choosing the most cost-effective plan without errors in calculation.

Therefore, the interest from the second bond must make up the difference: [ 1,900 - 1,150 = 750 ] The remaining investment in the second bond is the total investment minus the amount invested in the first bond: [ 32,000 - 20,000 = 12,000 ] Now we can find the interest rate of the second bond by dividing the annual interest from the second bond by the amount invested in it: [ r = frac{750}{12,000} ] [ r = 0.0625 ] To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: [ r times 100 = 0.0625 times 100 = 6.25% ] So, the interest rate of the other bond is boxed{6.25%} ."},{"instruction":"June's mom promises to pay her different amounts for every cloverleaf she picks from the lawn based on the number of petals.

The two segments crisscross when drawn from opposite points.    - We can select two points from X^+ in binom{8}{2} ways.    - Similarly, two points from Y^+ can be selected in binom{6}{2} ways. 3. **Total Intersections**:    - The total number of intersections is the product of the two combinations:    [    binom{8}{2} times binom{6}{2} = frac{8 times 7}{2 times 1} times frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 28 times 15 = 420.    ] Conclusion: - The maximum possible number of intersection points within the first quadrant that these segments can form is 420. boxed{The correct answer is C) 420.}"},{"instruction":"Given an acute triangle triangle ABC with internal angles A, B, C corresponding to sides a, b, c, vectors overrightarrow{m}=(sin C, cos C), overrightarrow{n}=(2sin A  cos B, sin B), and overrightarrow{m} perp overrightarrow{n}.

The perimeter l of triangle ABC is: l = a + b + c = 2 + 2sqrt{3} + frac{2cos A}{sin A} + frac{1}{sin A} = 2 + 2sqrt{3} + frac{2cos A + 1}{sin A} Using the half-angle identity, tan(frac{A}{2}) = frac{1 - cos A}{sin A}, we can rewrite the perimeter as: l = 2 + 2sqrt{3} + frac{1}{tan(frac{A}{2})} Since frac{A}{2} in (frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{4}), we have tan(frac{A}{2}) in (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1), which means: frac{1}{tan(frac{A}{2})} in (1, sqrt{3}) Therefore, the range of the perimeter of triangle ABC is: boxed{(3 + 2sqrt{3}, 2 + 3sqrt{3})} Note: There seems to have been a slight discrepancy in the calculation of the range for the perimeter in the original solution.

Points r_x corresponding to distinct points x are distinct since if x < y and r_x = r_y, the point y would lie in the interior of the interval I_gamma starting at x. Consequently, C is countable.    - Similarly, D is countable. 4. **Conclusion:**    Since B is an open set and both C and D are countable, A is a countable union of closed sets, which means A is an F_sigma set. Therefore, A_{ik} is an F_sigma set. 5. **Final step:**    Since {x : overline{D}f(x) > c} is a countable union of countable intersections of F_sigma sets, it is a Borel set.

So, the number of votes in favor is: Votes in favor = T - Votes against Votes in favor = 340 - 136 Votes in favor = 204 To find out how many more votes were in favor of the proposal than were against it, we subtract the number of votes against from the number of votes in favor: More votes in favor = Votes in favor - Votes against More votes in favor = 204 - 136 More votes in favor = 68 Therefore, there were boxed{68}  more votes in favor of the proposal than were against it."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, which is an equilateral triangle with side length 2, given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy overrightarrow{AB}=2overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{AC}=2overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}.

Hence, for no two rooks to attack each other, each rook must occupy a unique row and a unique column. 2. **White Squares Computation:**    - A chessboard contains 32 white squares and 32 black squares arranged alternately.    - Focusing only on white squares, we note that the challenge is to place a rook on eight distinct white squares.  3. **Row and Column Constraint:**    - As each rook must be on a unique row and unique column, the task is to place one rook in each of the 8 rows and 8 columns, restricted to the 16 white squares that fall on even and odd columns and rows. 4. **Distribution of White Squares by Parity:**    - White squares in odd-numbered rows fall into even-numbered columns.    - White squares in even-numbered rows fall into odd-numbered columns.    - This distinction splits our task into handling 4 rooks on white squares of the first type (odd rows, even columns) and 4 rooks on white squares of the second type (even rows, odd columns). 5. **Permutations Calculations:**    - The total number of ways to arrange 4 rooks in the white squares of the first type:      [      4! = 24      ]    - Similarly, the total number of ways to arrange another 4 rooks in the white squares of the second type:      [      4! = 24      ] 6. **Combining the Results:**    - Because the two sets of rooks are placed independently (one set in 4 white squares of the first type and another set in 4 white squares of the second type), the total number of distinct valid configurations is the product of the individual permutations:      [      text{Total configurations} = 4! times 4! = 24 times 24 = 576      ] # Conclusion: The number of different arrangements of 8 rooks on either colored white squares of a chessboard such that no rook attacks any other is ( boxed{576} )."},{"instruction":"Two circles have radii 1 and 3 and centers a distance 10 apart.

Expanding this,    [    begin{aligned}    alpha_n  &= R + frac{R}{2} + frac{R}{4} + frac{R}{8} + ldots + frac{R}{2^{n-1}} + frac{alpha}{2^{n}}     &= R left(1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + ldots + frac{1}{2^{n-1}}right) + frac{alpha}{2^n}     &= R cdot frac{1 - frac{1}{2^n}}{1 - frac{1}{2}} + frac{alpha}{2^n}     &= 2R left(1 - frac{1}{2^n}right) + frac{alpha}{2^n}    end{aligned}    ]     6. Taking the limit as ( n to infty ),     lim_{n to infty} frac{alpha}{2^n} = 0     so,     lim_{n to infty} alpha_n = 2R      7. Now consider the case where the constructed isosceles triangles are always acute-angled.    Let the vertices be (A', A'', ldots A^{(n)} ldots) and the angles at these vertices be denoted ( alpha', alpha'', ldots alpha^{(n)} ldots ). From the quadrilateral ( AA'CA_1 ):     alpha' + alpha_1 = 2R      8. Since     alpha_1 = R + frac{alpha}{2}      9. Therefore,     alpha' = R - frac{alpha}{2}      10. Generally,      alpha^{(n)} = R - frac{alpha^{(n-1)}}{2}       11. Expanding this,     [     begin{aligned}     alpha^{(n)}  &= R - frac{R}{2} + frac{R}{4} - ldots + (-1)^{n-1} frac{R}{2^{n-1}} + (-1)^{n} frac{alpha}{2^n}      &= R left(frac{1 + (-1)^n}{2}right) + (-1)^n frac{alpha}{2^n}      &= frac{2R}{3} + left( frac{2R}{3} + (-1)^n alpharight) frac{1}{2^n}     end{aligned}     ]      12. Hence, as ( n to infty ),      lim_{n to infty} alpha^{(n)} = frac{2R}{3} = 60^circ       Thus, in the second case, the limit of the angles at the vertices of the iteratively constructed triangles is ( boxed{60^circ} )."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)= frac{ax+b}{1+x^2} is an odd function defined on (1,1), and fleft( frac{1}{2}right)= frac{2}{5}.

This corresponds to the unknot, as the diagram can be continuously deformed into a simple loop without any crossings.    - If ( Gamma_B(D) ) has exactly three spanning trees, it must contain cycles. Each cycle of length ( k ) contributes at least ( k ) different cycles, implying ( k = 3 ). Thus, the graph must have a triangle (3-cycle) attached to a tree. 3. **Identifying the Knots:**    - The only knot that gives rise to a triangle in ( Gamma_B(D) ) is the trefoil knot. The tree part of the graph corresponds to the unknot.    - Therefore, the only knots with ( Gamma_B(D) ) having at most 3 spanning trees are the trefoil knot and the unknot. 4. **Conclusion:**    - It is impossible for a graph to have exactly two spanning trees, as spanning trees are either unique (for a tree) or more than one (for graphs with cycles). # Part (b) 1. **Established Result:**    - The determinant of a link ( L ) is equal to the number of spanning trees in the Tait graph of a link diagram. This is a known result in knot theory. 2. **Alexander Polynomial:**    - For a knot, the determinant ( |Delta(-1)| ), where ( Delta(t) ) is the Alexander polynomial, is odd. This can be shown by examining the properties of the Alexander polynomial and its evaluation at ( t = -1 ). 3. **Matrix Determinant:**    - The determinant is also the matrix determinant of an ( (n-1) times (n-1) ) submatrix of its labeling matrix. This determinant is non-zero modulo 2, implying it is odd. 4. **2-Labeling of Knots:**    - Knots cannot be 2-labeled because the only assignment of variables to edges such that at each crossing ( 2x_i - x_j - x_k = 0 pmod{2} ) is the monochromatic coloring. This implies that the determinant is odd. 5. **Conclusion:**    - For any knot and any diagram ( D ), ( Gamma_B(D) ) has an odd number of spanning trees.

We need to prove that there exist natural numbers ( b_1, b_2, dots, b_c ) such that ( {b_1, b_2, dots, b_c} ) forms a reduced residue system modulo both ( m ) and ( n ). 2. **Reduced Residue System:**    A reduced residue system modulo ( m ) is a set of integers that are coprime to ( m ) and represent all the distinct residue classes modulo ( m ). Since ( varphi(m) = c ), there are ( c ) such integers. 3. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**    The system ( x equiv r pmod{m} ) and ( x equiv s pmod{n} ) has a solution if and only if ( r equiv s pmod{gcd(m, n)} ). This is a direct consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 4. **Graph Theory Approach:**    Consider a bipartite graph where one set of vertices represents the reduced residue system modulo ( m ) and the other set represents the reduced residue system modulo ( n ). Connect a vertex ( r ) from the first set to a vertex ( s ) from the second set if ( r equiv s pmod{gcd(m, n)} ). 5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**    By the inclusion-exclusion principle, each part of the bipartite graph is regular, meaning each vertex in the first set has the same number of edges as each vertex in the second set. 6. **Hall's Marriage Theorem:**    Hall's Marriage Theorem states that a perfect matching exists in a bipartite graph if and only if for every subset ( A ) of the first set, the number of neighbors of ( A ) in the second set is at least as large as the size of ( A ). Given the regularity of the graph, this condition is satisfied. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since the bipartite graph is regular and satisfies Hall's condition, there exists a perfect matching. This means we can pair each element of the reduced residue system modulo ( m ) with a unique element of the reduced residue system modulo ( n ) such that the pairs are congruent modulo ( gcd(m, n) ). 8. **Existence of ( b_1, b_2, dots, b_c ):**    The perfect matching ensures that we can find ( b_1, b_2, dots, b_c ) such that ( {b_1, b_2, dots, b_c} ) forms a reduced residue system modulo both ( m ) and ( n ).

What is the minimum number of colors needed to achieve such a coloring?","output":"Let's begin by investigating the problem step by step to determine the minimum number of colors required:  Step 1: Identify the number of intersection points Suppose there are n = 2021 lines in a plane such that no two lines are parallel and no three lines intersect at a single point. We need to determine the total number of intersection points formed by these lines. The number of intersection points formed by n lines can be calculated using the combination formula: [ P = binom{2021}{2} = frac{2021 times 2020}{2} = 2021 times 1010 = 2041210 ] Thus, there are a total of 2,041,210 intersection points.  Step 2: Minimum number of colors required We need to color these points such that any two points on the same line, with no other points between them, have different colors. First, let us show that at least 3 colors are necessary. Consider the intersection of 3 lines forming a triangle.  For instance, let the three lines be d_1, d_2, and d_3, intersecting at points A, B, and C. When they intersect, they form a triangle with intersection points where no other line provides additional constraints beyond these 3 points. Each edge of the triangle must have points with distinct colors. Let's designate colors as follows: - Assign A color 1. - Assign B color 2. - Assign C color 3. Here's why 3 colors are essential: 1. On each line, the points must be colored differently. 2. In a triangle configuration, 3 colors ensure that no two adjacent points on the triangle edges share the same color.  Step 3: Demonstrating sufficiency of 3 colors through systematic approach Next, we demonstrate that 3 colors suffice by employing a method of systematic point coloring. Reorient the plane so that no line is vertical and sort the points of intersection by their x-coordinates as (A_1, A_2, dots, A_{n}).  Color the points in this order while ensuring that no two adjacent points on the same line have the same color. At each step, consider the point being colored and identify its neighbors (preceding points on the same lines where it intersects). Since the maximum number of intersecting points forming a triangle is 3, consider three colors: - Assign color 1 to the first point, A_1. - For each subsequent point A_i:   - Look at its adjacent preceding points on all intersecting lines.   - Assign the smallest valid color not already used in its immediate neighborhood (i.e., not sharing the color of the immediately adjacent points on intersecting lines). Since any two adjacent points on a line must have different colors, and every insertion respects this rule, at most 3 colors will always suffice. # Conclusion: The minimum number of colors required to color the points of intersection such that no two adjacent points on a line share the same color through this systematic methodology is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine the option that represents the simplest form of a radical expression from the following: A: sqrt{3} B: sqrt{4} C: sqrt{8} D: sqrt{frac{1}{2}}","output":"To determine the simplest form of a radical expression, we should look for any perfect squares under the square root that can be simplified.

Given f(-1) = 1, using equation (1), we find: f(-1) = f(2). We also have f(0) = -2, which, similarly, gives: f(0) = f(3). The symmetry of f(x) about the point (-frac{3}{4}, 0) implies: f(-1) = -fleft(-frac{1}{2}right) quad text{(2)}, and using the periodic property from equation (1), we get: fleft(-frac{1}{2}right) = fleft(-frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2}right) = f(1).

We aim to show that the smallest possible s for which such an array exists is m + n - gcd(m, n). 2. **Construction for s = m + n - gcd(m, n):**    Let gcd(m, n) = d. Consider a d times d block of consecutive integers. For a non-negative integer k, we can construct the block as follows:    [    begin{array}{cccc}    k+1 & k+2 & cdots & k+d     k+2 & k+3 & cdots & k+1     vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots     k+d & k+1 & cdots & k+d-1    end{array}    ]    We denote this block as k^*.

Since each column contains m distinct consecutive integers, the largest number in the grid is at most m + n - 1. For each row, the smallest number it contains should be at most n; otherwise, the grid would contain a number at least n + 1 + (m - 1) = m + n, which is a contradiction. 5. **Row Analysis:**    For any positive integer i with n leq i leq m, each row contains exactly one occurrence of i. Thus, there are exactly n occurrences of i. The number of times i occurs can be written as a_i + a_{i-1} + cdots + a_{i-n+1} = n. This implies that the sequence a_k repeats every n terms. 6. **Reduction Process:**    We remove the n columns having the smallest number leq n. For the remaining (m-n) times n grid, we subtract n from each number. This process induces a working table for (m-n, n, s-n) from the original table for (m, n, s). By applying the Euclidean algorithm, we reduce the problem to a d times d grid where d = gcd(m, n). 7. **Final Step:**    For a d times d grid, the smallest s must be d since each row has d consecutive positive elements. Thus, s + 2d - m - n geq d or s geq m + n - d. Since we already provided a construction for s = m + n - gcd(m, n), this is the smallest possible value.

Examining the midpoints on edges and centers of faces shows how to achieve the subdivisions mentioned. 4. **Dividing an Octahedron:**     - Consider similarly subdividing a regular octahedron:         - Perform homotheties with coefficient (frac{1}{2}) centered at each vertex of the octahedron.     - Each division produces:         - Six smaller octahedrons corresponding to the original vertices.         - Eight regular tetrahedrons at the faces of the original octahedron. 5. **Iterative Process:**    - After the first subdivision (starting with the tetrahedron), edge lengths reduce to (frac{1}{2}):        - Results: one octahedron and several tetrahedrons with edge length (frac{1}{2}). 6. **Subsequent Subdivisions:**     - Perform subdivisions iteratively:         - Second step results in octahedrons and tetrahedrons with edge lengths (frac{1}{4}).         - Continue this process iteratively. 7. **Edge Length Calculation:**     - After (k) steps:         - The edge length of the divided shapes will be:         [         frac{1}{2^k}         ]     - Specifically, to ensure side lengths are less than (frac{1}{100}):         [         frac{1}{2^k} < frac{1}{100}         ]      8. **Solving for (k):**     - By calculating:     [     2^k > 100     ]     - Taking logarithms (base 2):     [     k > log_2(100)     ]     - Knowing:     [     log_2(100) approx 6.644     ]     - Hence, (k) must be at least 7. 9. **Conclusion:**     - After 7 subdivisions, edge lengths will be:     [     frac{1}{2^7} = frac{1}{128} < frac{1}{100}     ] Thus, it is possible to subdivide a regular tetrahedron with an edge length of (1) into regular tetrahedrons and octahedrons with edge lengths less than (frac{1}{100}) through repeated subdivisions.

Thus, tsqrt{1 - t^2} neq 0, and we can divide both sides by this expression to eliminate the square root: frac{9(1 - 4t^2 + 4t^4)}{tsqrt{1 - t^2}} = frac{8(1 - t^2) + 8t^2}{tsqrt{1 - t^2}} + 8sqrt{2} After simplification and solving for t, we find that t = sin alpha = -frac{1}{3}. Now we can find sin 2alpha: sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha = 2(-frac{1}{3})(-sqrt{1 - (-frac{1}{3})^2}) = boxed{-frac{1}{9}}"},{"instruction":"A morning passenger train from Budapest to Nové Zámky travels at a speed of ( v_{1} ).

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Initial Setup for a Special Case:**    - First, we consider the special case where (left|alpha_{j}right|=1) for all ( j in {1, 2, ldots, n} ). In this situation, we need to show that there exists (z_{0} in mathbb{C}) with (left|z_{0}right|=1) such that (left|f(z_{0})right| geq 2^{n}). 2. **Expression for Polynomial ( f(z) ):**    - We can write ( f(z) = z^n + c_{n-1} z^{n-1} + cdots + c_1 z + c_{0} ), where ( c_0 = alpha_{1} alpha_{2} cdots alpha_{n} ). Because (left|alpha_{j}right|=1) for all (j), we have (left|c_{0}right|=1). 3. **Choose a Root of Unity:**    - Let ( omega in mathbb{C} ) be such that (omega^n = c_0). We define (varepsilon = e^{frac{2 pi i}{n}}). 4. **Summation Argument:**    - We consider the sum:  sum_{k=0}^{n-1} left|fleft(omega varepsilon^{k}right)right| geq left|sum_{k=0}^{n-1} fleft(omega varepsilon^{k}right)right|.     - Expanding the right-hand side, we get:  left|sum_{k=0}^{n-1} fleft(omega varepsilon^{k}right)right|= left| omega^n left(sum_{k=0}^{n-1} varepsilon^{kn}right) + c_{n-1}omega^{n-1} left(sum_{k=0}^{n-1} varepsilon^{k(n-1)}right) + cdots + c_{1} omega left(sum_{k=0}^{n-1} varepsilon^kright) + n c_{0} right|.  5. **Simplifying the Sums:**    - Note that:  sum_{k=0}^{n-1} varepsilon^{kn} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1 = 0, similarly all other terms involving sums of roots of unity factors will also zero out leaving:  left|n c_{0}right| = n left|c_{0}right| = n = 2n.     - Therefore:  sum_{k=0}^{n-1} left| f left( omega varepsilon^{k} right) right| geq left| 2n right| = 2n.  6. **Application of the Average Value:**    - By the average value principle, there exists (k in {0, 1, 2, ldots, n - 1}) such that:  left|fleft(omega varepsilon^{k}right)right| geq 2.     - Let (z_0 = omega varepsilon^k), which satisfies (left|z_0right| = 1). 7. **General Case:**    - For any (alpha_{j} in mathbb{C}), let (beta_{j} = frac{alpha_{j}}{left|alpha_{j}right|}) if ( alpha_{j} neq 0 ) otherwise (beta_{j} = 0). We need to show:  frac{left|z - alpha_{i}right|}{1 + left|alpha_{j}right|} geq frac{left|z - beta_{j}right|}{1 + left|beta_{j}right|}  for any (left|zright| = 1).    - Reducing further:  frac{left|z - alpha_{j}right|}{1 + left|alpha_{j}right|} geq frac{left|z - beta_{j}right|}{1 + left|beta_{j}right|}  using the triangle inequality argument in complex plane geometry. 8. **Final Conclusion Using Previous Argument:**    - Using previous arguments established that (left|z_0 - beta_jright| geq 2), hence,  frac{prod_{j=1}^{n} left|z_0 - beta_jright|}{prod_{j=1}^{n} left(1 + left|alpha_{j}right| right)} geq frac{2^n}{prod_{j=1}^{n} 2} = frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.

This implies that |S_0| = |S_1| = 2^k for S = {0, 1, 2, ldots, 2^{k+1}-1}. 4. **Sum of Powers**:    We need to show that for s = 0, 1, ldots, k-1,    [    sum_{x in S_0} x^s = sum_{y in S_1} y^s    ] 5. **Base Case**:    For k = 1, S = {0, 1, 2, 3}:    - S_0 = {0, 3} (since t_0 = 0 and t_3 = 0)    - S_1 = {1, 2} (since t_1 = 1 and t_2 = 1)    - Check sums:      [      sum_{x in S_0} x^0 = 1 + 1 = 2, quad sum_{y in S_1} y^0 = 1 + 1 = 2      ]      [      sum_{x in S_0} x^1 = 0 + 3 = 3, quad sum_{y in S_1} y^1 = 1 + 2 = 3      ] 6. **Inductive Step**:    Assume the property holds for k = n.

From the property of a parabola, we know that for any point on the parabola, the tangent lines at that point make equal angles with the focal radius and the directrix. 3. Since (OA) and (OB) are tangent lines, they are perpendicular to the focal radius at points (A) and (B) (i.e., (OA perp AF) and (OB perp BF)). 4. Consider the points (A_1) and (B_1). They lie on the directrix and act as feet of perpendiculars from (A) and (B) to the directrix. 5.

Since the retailer buys 100 pens for the price of 36 pens, we can say that the cost price of each pen for the retailer is the price of 36 pens divided by 100. Let's assume the market price of each pen is 1 (for simplicity, since we don't have the actual price). Then, the cost price of 36 pens would be 36 * 1 = 36. The cost price of 100 pens for the retailer would be 36 (since he gets 100 pens for the price of 36 pens). Now, let's calculate the selling price of 100 pens with a 1% discount. If the market price of each pen is 1, then the selling price of 100 pens without any discount would be 100 * 1 = 100. With a 1% discount, the discount amount on 100 pens would be 1% of 100, which is 1. So, the selling price of 100 pens after a 1% discount would be 100 - 1 = 99.

For ( i in {1, 2} ), let ( r_i ) be the reflection about ( g_i ). 2. **Define the rotation:**    Note that the composition of the two reflections ( rho := r_2 r_1 ) is a rotation about the point ( O ) by an angle ( 2alpha ). This is a standard result in geometry: the composition of two reflections over intersecting lines results in a rotation by twice the angle between the lines. 3. **Angle properties:**    Given that ( alpha = qpi ) where ( q ) is irrational, the angle ( 2alpha = 2qpi ) is also irrational. This implies that the rotation angle ( 2alpha ) is not a rational multiple of ( pi ). 4. **Invariance under rotation:**    Since ( M ) is invariant under the rotation ( rho ), any point ( P in M ) will be mapped to another point in ( M ) by ( rho ). Specifically, ( rho^k(P) ) for any integer ( k ) will also be in ( M ). 5. **Non-triviality of the set ( M ):**    Given that ( M ) has at least two elements, there exists at least one point ( P in M ) that is not the center ( O ) of rotation. 6. **Infinitely many distinct points:**    Since ( 2alpha ) is an irrational multiple of ( pi ), the rotations ( rho^k(P) ) for different values of ( k ) will produce distinct points. This is because an irrational rotation angle ensures that the points ( rho^k(P) ) do not coincide for different ( k ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the set ( M ) must contain infinitely many points, as the points ( rho^k(P) ) for ( k in mathbb{N}_0 ) are all distinct and belong to ( M ).

Let's consider a 4026-digit number ( A ) which is formed using 2013 digits of 1 and 2013 digits of 2. We are to determine the number of minimum moves Petya needs to swap the digits such that ( A ) is divisible by 11. Each swap costs 1 ruble, and we need to find the maximum amount Vasya can earn if Petya strives to minimize his cost. 2. To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we use the divisibility rule: the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be divisible by 11. 3. Suppose ( k ) is the number of 1s in the odd positions, and ( ell = 2013 - k ) is the number of 2s in the odd positions. Similarly, in the even positions, there are ( k ) digits of 2 and ( ell ) digits of 1. 4. The difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the even positions can be calculated as:    [    text{Sum of odd-position digits} = k cdot 1 + ell cdot 2 = k + 2 (2013 - k) = 4026 - k    ]    [    text{Sum of even-position digits} = k cdot 2 + ell cdot 1 = 2k + (2013 - k) = 2013 + k    ] 5. The difference between these sums is:    [    (4026 - k) - (2013 + k) = 2013 - 2k    ] 6. For ( A ) to be divisible by 11, ( 2013 - 2k ) must be divisible by 11. Since 2013 is divisible by 11 (2013 = 183 × 11), we need ( 2k ) to be divisible by 11. Thus, ( k ) itself must be a multiple of 11. 7. Given the starting number ( k ), let's analyze how many steps Petya needs to take to change ( k ) to the nearest multiple of 11. For simplicity, assume Vasya initially sets ( k = 5 ). 8. The closest multiples of 11 to 5 are 0 and 11.

Finally, let's use the small buses. Each small bus can carry 30 passengers, and there are 10 available. To find out how many small buses are needed, we divide the remaining number of passengers by the capacity of a small bus: 150 / 30 = 5 small buses.

Let (A_1) be the vertex of the polygon that is closest to the point (O). 3. To explore the angles created by the point (O) and the vertices of the polygon, we decompose the polygon into triangles by drawing diagonals from vertex (A_1) to non-adjacent vertices.     This will form the triangles (A_1 A_2 A_3, A_1 A_3 A_4, ldots, A_1 A_{n-1} A_n). 4. The point (O) will lie inside one of these triangles. Without loss of generality, assume (O) lies inside the triangle (A_1 A_k A_{k+1}). 5. If the point (O) lies precisely on the side (A_1 A_k), then: [ angle A_1 O A_k = pi, ] and the condition is satisfied. 6. In the case where (O) lies strictly within the triangle (A_1 A_k A_{k+1}), let us examine the respective angles.

Therefore, the angles (angle A_k O A_1) and (angle A_{k+1} O A_1) are influenced accordingly. Specifically, observe that: [ angle A_k O A_1 + angle A_{k+1} O A_1 = left(pi - angle O A_1 A_k - angle O A_k A_1right) + left(pi - angle O A_1 A_{k+1} - angle O A_{k+1} A_1right). ] 9.

Prove that m geqslant 2 n /(k+1).","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:     - Consider the initial setup where we have (n + 1) monomials (1, x, x^2, ldots, x^n) on the board.     - We agree that each minute, (k) boys simultaneously calculate the sum of some two polynomials written on the board and write the result on the board.     - After (m) minutes, the board contains, among other polynomials, the sums of the form (S_1 = 1 + x, S_2 = 1 + x + x^2, ldots, S_n = 1 + x + x^2 + ldots + x^n). 2. **Final Situation**:     - Let's analyze the final situation on the board. Every polynomial (P) that appears as a sum of polynomials (Q) and (R) will have directed arrows from (P) to (Q) and (R).     - If an oriented path leads from a polynomial (F) to (G), we will say that (G) participates in (F) (and (F) participates in itself too). 3. **Polynomial Participation and Non-negativity**:     - It is clear that every coefficient in the polynomial (F - G) will be non-negative.     - Suppose every polynomial on the board is a sum of different powers of (x). Specifically, if a coefficient of a polynomial is at least 2, then all polynomials it participates in will have the corresponding coefficient also at least 2.

Each polynomial (S_1, ldots, S_n) will be termed a final polynomial. Each polynomial that participates in (S_n) (i.e., in the sum of all original monomials) will be called essential.     - There are (n) final polynomials. 5. **Inductive Argument**:     - We will show by induction on (p) that a polynomial with (p) non-zero coefficients involves exactly (2p-1) polynomials (including (p) monomials).     - **Base Case**: For (p = 1), it's trivially true.     - **Inductive Step**: Assume it holds for (p). Let (P) be a polynomial obtained as the sum of (Q) and (R), with non-zero coefficients in (P, Q,) and (R) being (p, q,) and (r) respectively, so (p = q + r). By the induction hypothesis, (Q) and (R) involve (2q-1) and (2r-1) polynomials respectively. Since there are no common monomials in (Q) and (R), (P) will involve ((2q-1) + (2r-1) + 1 = 2p-1) polynomials. 6. **Final and Essential Polynomials**:     - Showing that each minute at most one final and essential polynomial appears. Assume in some minute, essential polynomials (S_p) and (S_q) appear simultaneously, where (p < q). Then, considering the first moment a polynomial (P) containing both (S_p) and (S_q) appears, it must have been formed from polynomials each containing the monomial (x^p). The coefficient of (x^p) in (P) would be at least 2, which is impossible in our setup. 7. **Total Number of Polynomials**:     - There are (n) final and (2n + 1) essential polynomials. Not more than (m) among them are both. Thus, the total number shown on the board is at least (n + (2n + 1) - m). 8. **Initial and Added Polynomials**:     - Initially, there were (n + 1) polynomials, and no more than (mk) new ones added.     - Therefore, ( (n + 1) + mk geq n + (2n + 1) - m ). 9. **Deriving the Inequality**:     - Simplifying this:      [     (n + 1) + mk geq n + (2n + 1) - m      ]     [     mk + m + 1 geq 2n     ]     [     m(k + 1) geq 2n     ] 10. **Conclusion**:     [     m geq frac{2n}{k + 1}     ] Thus, we have proven that ( m geq frac{2n}{k + 1} ).

The sum of the numbers in any row must be non-positive, and the sum of the numbers in any column must be non-negative. This implies that the overall sum of all cells in the table must be zero to satisfy both conditions simultaneously, since every cell contributes to both a row and a column. 2. **Summation Condition:**      Let's sum the numbers in all the rows and then in all the columns.    [    text{Sum of all cells} = sum_{i=1}^{15} left( sum_{j=1}^{15} a_{ij} right)    ]    Given that the sum in each row is non-positive:    [    sum_{j=1}^{15} a_{ij} le 0 quad text{for all} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, 15    ]    Therefore, the sum across all rows is also non-positive:    [    sum_{i=1}^{15} left( sum_{j=1}^{15} a_{ij} right) le 0    ] 3. **Column Condition:**      Similarly, since the sum in each column is non-negative:    [    sum_{i=1}^{15} a_{ij} ge 0 quad text{for all} quad j = 1, 2, ldots, 15    ]    Thus, the sum across all columns is also non-negative:    [    sum_{j=1}^{15} left( sum_{i=1}^{15} a_{ij} right) ge 0    ] 4. **Zero Sum Requirement:**      Combining the above results, we get:    [    sum_{i=1}^{15} left( sum_{j=1}^{15} a_{ij} right) ge 0 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{15} left( sum_{j=1}^{15} a_{ij} right) le 0    ]    Therefore:    [    sum_{i=1}^{15} left( sum_{j=1}^{15} a_{ij} right) = 0    ] 5. **Implies Zero Sum in Rows and Columns:**      Since the sum is zero and each row is non-positive, and each column is non-negative, the sum of numbers in each row and each column must actually be zero.

Given A={x|a-1 < x < a+1} and B={x|xgeqslant 3 or xleqslant 1}, for A and B to be complementary, the intervals defined by A must exactly fill the gaps in B. Therefore, the endpoints of A must match the boundaries that define B.

So, we conclude: [ boxed{a=2} ] **(2)** For p to be a sufficient condition for q, Asubseteq B must be true. Given A={x|a-1 < x < a+1}, for it to be a subset of B, the range of A cannot intersect with the interval (1,3), as B is defined to exclude values strictly between 1 and 3. Therefore, the intervals for A have to be entirely outside the range (1,3), leading to two possible inequalities: [ begin{aligned} &a+1 leqslant 1 quad text{or} quad a-1 geqslant 3 end{aligned} ] Solving these inequalities, we get: [ begin{aligned} &a leqslant 0 quad text{from} quad a+1leqslant 1  &a geqslant 4 quad text{from} quad a-1 geqslant 3 end{aligned} ] Therefore, the values of a that satisfy p being a sufficient condition for q are in the ranges (-infty, 0] and [4, +infty).

The probability of drawing a blue card from the box is given by the ratio of the number of blue cards to the total number of cards in the box. Since there are 8 red cards, the total number of cards is x + 8. The problem states that the frequency of drawing a blue card stabilizes around 0.6, which means the probability of drawing a blue card is 0.6. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship: [ frac{x}{x + 8} = 0.6 ] To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by x + 8 to get rid of the denominator: [ x = 0.6(x + 8) ] Expanding the right side of the equation gives: [ x = 0.6x + 4.8 ] Subtracting 0.6x from both sides to isolate x on one side gives: [ x - 0.6x = 4.8 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 0.4x = 4.8 ] Dividing both sides by 0.4 to solve for x gives: [ x = frac{4.8}{0.4} ] Simplifying the fraction gives: [ x = 12 ] After solving the equation, we find that x = 12, which means there are 12 blue cards in the wooden box.

Therefore, the range of k is k < - sqrt {3} or k > sqrt {3}. (II) By the theorem of the perpendicular bisector, OP is perpendicular to OM, so P lies on the circle with OC as the diameter. The center of this circle is (0, 2) with a radius of 2. The equation of this circle (inside circle C) is x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4. Solving x^2 + (y-4)^2 = 4 and x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4 simultaneously, we get x = - sqrt {3} and x = sqrt {3}.

This is because repeating either of these would not satisfy the product of 189 (i.e., (9 times 9 = 81) or (7 times 7 = 49), which do not divide 189). 4. **Finding digit combinations:**    The possible digits must therefore be:    [    3, 7, text{and } 9.    ]     5. **Generating possible three-digit numbers:**    Using the digits 3, 7, and 9, we can form the following permutations to create three-digit numbers:    [    379, 397, 739, 793, 937, 973.    ]     6. **Checking primality:**    To find the solutions, we must check which of these numbers are prime.    - **379:**      - It is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).      - The sum of its digits is (3 + 7 + 9 = 19), not divisible by 3.      - It does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.      - Checking divisibility by 7, 11, or smaller prime numbers: 379 is found to be prime.    - **397:**      - It does not fulfill the divisibility criteria for 2, 3, or 5 for the same reasons as 379.      - Upon checking, 397 is also found to be prime.    - **739:**      - Similar checks reveal that 739 is prime.    - **793:**      - Similar checks reveal that 793 is not prime (it is divisible by 13).    - **937:**      - 937 meets the criteria for being prime.    - **973:**      - 973 is not prime (it is divisible by 7). # Conclusion: The three-digit prime numbers whose digits multiply to 189 are: [ boxed{379, 397, 739, 937} ]"},{"instruction":"A bakery now sells four kinds of rolls.

Fold the three smaller triangles along the original triangle's height such that each smaller triangle is folded inward.     5. After folding, the shape will transform into a hexagon (\`six-sided polygon\`). Each set of three triangles will stack upon one another. 6. To achieve a quadrilateral with three layers, fold this resulting hexagon along one of its diagonals (joining two opposite vertices). 7. When the hexagon is folded along this diagonal, it creates a trapezoid (a four-sided figure) with all three layers from the original hexagon: # Conclusion: By following these steps, an equilateral triangular piece of paper can be folded into a trapezoid that is three layers thick throughout.

Let H' be the reflection of H across BC. 1. **Proving M is the midpoint of HA'**:         - Since M is the midpoint of [BC], we have overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{MC}.    - In cyclic quadrilateral A'BHC, the diagonals AA' and HC intersect at M.     - By properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the angles  angle BA'H = angle BAH'. Since triangle A'HA is isosceles with A'H=AH, M must be the midpoint of HA'. 2. **Proving H' lies on Gamma**:    - Since H' is the reflection of H over BC,  angle BH'C = angle BHC, and BHC is an angle subtended by the arc BAC.     - Therefore, by symmetry, H' must also subtend the same arc and hence lie on Gamma. 3. **Proving H' and A' are symmetric about the perpendicular bisector of [BC]**:    - Consider the perpendicular bisector of [BC]. This line is also the angle bisector of angle BAC.    - Since A' is directly opposite A on Gamma, and H' is a reflection of H, both points A' and H' lie on circles centered at M (the circle (BCMH') passes through A').    - By symmetry, A' and H' must be symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of [BC]. 4. **Proving (AO) and (AH) are symmetric about the angle bisector of widehat{A}**:    - The line (AO) connects A to the center O of the circumcircle Gamma, and (AH) connects A to the orthocenter H.    - If we reflect the line (AH) over the angle bisector of angle BAC, it maps onto (AO), maintaining the same angles due to symmetry.     - Therefore, since A H and A O subtend equal angles on either side, (AO) and (AH) are symmetric about the dipector of widehat{A}.

Lemma 1:** In an acute-angled triangle ABC, sum sqrt{frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}} geqslant sum frac{a}{b+c-a}. **3. Proof of Lemma 1:** Suppose (a geq b geq c).
