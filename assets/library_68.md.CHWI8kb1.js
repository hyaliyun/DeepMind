In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. formula for the stats adjustments for both Sapphire and Lily: new stats = new age / initial age x stats from previous round. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points. Add a list of 3 epic spells that require super high stats. Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","output":"This setup places you, Sapphire, a prodigious young mage champion, against Lily, a surprisingly robust challenger for her age. The twist of age regression adds a unique layer of complexity to this match. Given the scenario, here's how everything will play out: # Initial Stats - **Sapphire’s Initial Stats:** Spell Power: 90, Performance: 85 - **Lily’s Initial Stats:** Spell Power: 60, Performance: 70 # Spell Lists Sapphire’s List: 1. **Moonlight Sonata**: Spell Power: 20, Points: 60 2. **Aurora Cascade**: Spell Power: 30, Points: 70 3. **Celestial Mirror**: Spell Power: 40, Points: 80 4. **Phoenix’s Rebirth**: Spell Power: 50, Points: 90 5. **Starlight Veil**: Spell Power: 60, Points: 100 6. **Eclipse Dance**: Spell Power: 70, Points: 110 7. **Mystic Aurora**: Spell Power: 80, Points: 120 8. **Galactic Waltz**: Spell Power: 90, Points: 130 9. **Temporal Bloom**: Spell Power: 100, Points: 140 10. **Arcadia's Whisper**: Spell Power: 100, Points: 150 Lily’s List: 1. **Butterfly Whirl**: Spell Power: 10, Points: 40 2. **Rainbow Bridge**: Spell Power: 15, Points: 45 3. **Glimmering Fog**: Spell Power: 20, Points: 50 4. **Whispering Winds**: Spell Power: 25, Points: 55 5. **Chorus of Light**: Spell Power: 30, Points: 60 6. **Frostfire Galaxy**: Spell Power: 35, Points: 65 7. **Dawn’s Embrace**: Spell Power: 40, Points: 70 8. **Twilight Flicker**: Spell Power: 45, Points: 75 9. **Luminous Coral**: Spell Power: 50, Points: 80 10. **Sunset Serenade**: Spell Power: 50, Points: 85 Epic Spells (available to both if stats permit): 1. **Nebula Dream**: Spell Power: 120, Points: 200 2. **Aether’s Pulse**: Spell Power: 130, Points: 210 3. **Infinity Echo**: Spell Power: 140, Points: 220 # Mechanics - **Childish Meter**: Fills based on the formula: Turns Squared × (100 - Performance) / 500. When filled (reaches or exceeds 1), subtract 10% from Performance, and it resets but doesn’t empty, allowing overflow to carry over. # Scenario Playthrough Round 1 begins with both contestants at their initial ages and stats. - **Sapphire’s Age**: 16 - **Lily’s Age**: 6 **Round 1:** - You need to announce your chosen spell from your list. - Lily casts **Butterfly Whirl**. As you cast your first spell, Lily's secret spell activates, causing you to regress. - **After Round 1:** - **Sapphire’s Age**: 14 (80% of initial) - **Lily’s Age**: 8 (40% of initial) **Sapphire’s New Stats:** Spell Power: 72 (90 × 0.8), Performance: 68 (85 × 0.8) **Lily’s New Stats:** Spell Power: 84 (60 × 1.4), Performance: 98 (70 × 1.4) This pattern of regression and improvement continues, with the Childish Meter affecting your performance adversely. # Strategy Given this dynamic, conserving high-power spells for late-game may backfire due to degrading stats. Opting for mid-tier spells initially might secure early points without risking failure from stat drops. Awareness of your decreasing capacity, balanced against Lily's increasing prowess, requires a blend of tactical spell choice and timing. Monitoring the Childish Meter is crucial; strategic spell selection can mitigate its impact and ensure you maximize performance scores despite the handicap. Do note, the wide range of required stats suggests flexibility in your approach, but the constant evolution of Lily's capabilities, contrasted against your own regression, introduces a strategic depth that will challenge your reigning champion status to its core. Your successful casting and the spectacle of your spells hinge not just on raw power but on the nuanced understanding of this shifting landscape. The duel isn't just about showcasing your mastery but adapting to and overcoming unanticipated adversity. **Point to Remember:** The duel's unpredictable nature, coupled with the unique mechanics at play, ensures that each choice carries significant weight. Your journey through this high-stakes, high-fantasy scenario will demand not just magical acumen but profound adaptability and strategic foresight. **Your Next Move:** Choose your first spell wisely and strategize for the long game. Keep in mind, with every spell you cast, Lily grows not just in age, and her spells, potentially stolen from your list, could tilt the scales further. The duel begins not as a test of power, but of wits and resilience. Good luck, Sapphire. May your spells dazzle and your strategy outshine the competition."},{"instruction":"Can you make this just like a movie script please?: [first lines; the screen shows a dark background as Lightning McQueen's voice is heard, inhales and exhales deeply.] Lightning McQueen: Okay, here we go.

It started off as any normal day would. I woke up feeling hopeful, clad in my favorite jeans and a cozy sweater, ready to tackle my classes and the library session I had planned. If only I'd known what the universe had in store for me. It all happened during the break between my morning lectures. My friends and I decided to hang out in the quad, soaking up some sun and enjoying the break from our hectic schedule. Little did I know, a harmless joke was about to escalate into one of the most embarrassing moments of my college life. As I leaned over to retrieve my notebook from my bag, I suddenly felt a sharp tug. Before I could even process what was happening, I found myself hoisted up in the air, dangling helplessly from a tree branch. Yes, Diary, a hanging wedgie. My friends burst into laughter, thinking it was just a hilarious prank, not realizing how stuck I actually was. The fabric of my jeans wedged uncomfortably, making every second feel like an eternity. The laughter soon attracted a modest crowd, and with each passing moment, I felt my cheeks burning brighter with embarrassment. It felt like I was there for hours, dangling like a piece of strange art for everyone to see, but in reality, it was probably closer to the most mortifying fifteen minutes of my life. Eventually, with some effort and a lot of apologies from my friends, I was set free. But the damage was done. The rest of the day, I walked around feeling the ghost of that wedgie, haunted by the whispers and snickers in the hallway. Coming back to my dorm, I couldn't decide whether to laugh it off or hide under my covers forever. It's strange how a moment of silliness can turn into a memory you know you'll never forget - and not necessarily for good reasons. But then, Diary, it's these moments that remind me that life is unpredictable. You can head out in the morning, thinking your day will be just about classes and library sessions, only to end up with a story that you know is going to be retold for years. So, here I am, nursing my pride and my sore... well, you know. Tomorrow is another day, and hopefully, it'll be less eventful. For now, I'm just going to curl up with a book and try to forget the day's events. Until tomorrow, A very embarrassed (but resilient) college girl."},{"instruction":"Have her add how it made her body feel, and describe her panties.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill this request."},{"instruction":"Continie the story","output":"Continuing on a more general and respectful path from where we left off: October 10, 2023 [...] Despite the embarrassing ordeal, there's a part of me that's strangely proud of how I managed to handle the situation. Once the initial shock wore off and my friends helped me down, I did my best to shrug it off with as much grace as I could muster, even managing a small smile amidst my discomfort. It was a test of my resilience, in a way, and though I hope to never repeat such an experience, it taught me that I could face unexpected and awkward moments head-on. However, this incident did more than just leave me with a bruised ego. Physically, I felt sore and a bit delicate for the rest of the day. The tension and awkward suspension had stretched my muscles in ways they definitely weren't used to, leaving me with an uncomfortable reminder of the day's events every time I moved. Comfort became my number one priority when I finally made it back to my room, opting for the softest leggings and a loose t-shirt, a stark contrast to my earlier outfit that had become an unwitting accomplice in my misadventure. The rest of the evening was spent in quiet reflection and a bit of self-care. A hot shower, my favorite comfort food, and some soothing music helped heal both my physical discomfort and my wounded pride. It was a reminder that taking care of oneself, mentally and physically, is paramount, especially after experiencing something as jarring as today. As strange as it sounds, this bizarre turn of events also brought me closer to my friends. Despite their initial laughter, they were genuinely apologetic and concerned, sticking by my side for the rest of the day to make sure I was alright. Their support turned a potentially isolating incident into a bonding experience, reinforcing the idea that true friends will be there for you, even in your most embarrassing moments. So, dear diary, as I end today's entry, I'm reminded of the unpredictable nature of life and the importance of resilience, self-care, and surrounding myself with people who care. Today was indeed a day for the books, and while I'm not eager to repeat it, I'm grateful for the lessons it inadvertently taught me.

However, I can guide you through the process of building the software as per the provided specification. Let's break down the initial steps and provide some foundational Python code snippets that align with the specifications. To keep things simple and focused, the explanation will progress in stages. # Setting up the Development Environment 1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 2. **Install Required Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary libraries. For the purpose of this guide, we are focusing on \`Tkinter\` for the GUI, which comes bundled with Python, so there's no need for separate installation. However, for document handling and potential web scraping, you might need additional libraries such as \`python-docx\`, \`beautifulsoup4\`, \`requests\`, or \`selenium\`. \`\`\`bash pip install python-docx beautifulsoup4 requests selenium pyperclip \`\`\` # Starting the Project Let's begin by setting up a simple GUI using Tkinter. This will serve as the backbone of our application. Step 1: Creating the Main GUI Layout Create a file named \`main.py\` and add the following code to set up a basic GUI layout: \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, ttk class DocumentTranslatorApp: def __init__(self, root): self.root = root root.title(\\"Document Translator\\") # Language Choices self.languages = [\\"English\\", \\"Amharic\\", \\"Oromo\\", \\"Tigrinya\\"] self.language_var = tk.StringVar() # Layout ttk.Label(root, text=\\"Select Language:\\").grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=tk.W) self.language_dropdown = ttk.Combobox(root, textvariable=self.language_var, values=self.languages, state=\\"readonly\\") self.language_dropdown.grid(column=1, row=0, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E)) ttk.Button(root, text=\\"Select Document\\", command=self.select_document).grid(column=0, row=1, sticky=tk.W) ttk.Button(root, text=\\"Translate\\", command=self.translate_document).grid(column=1, row=1, sticky=tk.W) self.text_area = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=50) self.text_area.grid(column=0, row=2, columnspan=2, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E)) def select_document(self): # Placeholder for document selection method pass def translate_document(self): # Placeholder for translate method pass if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": root = tk.Tk() app = DocumentTranslatorApp(root) root.mainloop() \`\`\` This code sets up a basic window with a dropdown for language selection, buttons for document selection and translation, and a text area to display results. The methods \`select_document\` and \`translate_document\` are placeholders for now. Step 2: Implementing the \`select_document\` Method The next step involves allowing the user to select a document from their system. Update the \`select_document\` method with the following code: \`\`\`python def select_document(self): file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename() if file_path: # For now, just show the path in the text area self.text_area.delete(1.0, tk.END) self.text_area.insert(tk.END, file_path) \`\`\` This method uses a file dialog to get the file path and displays it in the text area. In a complete implementation, this would involve reading the document and preparing it for translation. Step 3: Outline for \`translate_document\` Method The \`translate_document\` function's actual implementation would depend significantly on how you decide to handle the translation without using the Google Translate API. One approach might involve scraping the Google Translate website, but this is against Google's terms of service. Alternatively, you could use a library that doesn't enforce API key usage for simple tasks, or switch to language-specific libraries for each supported language, if available. Since implementing such a function would require more detail and exploration of legally viable options, we'll not proceed with coding this part. It's a complex task that would involve either web scraping (which has legal and ethical considerations) or finding a library that supports translation for the specified languages without API usage, which may significantly limit options and capabilities. --- This guide has provided a foundation for starting the Document Translator application, including setting up the GUI and implementing basic file handling. Further development would require detailed functionality for unsupported translation and custom dictionary definitions, which involves more complexity and potentially integrating specific libraries or services that provide translation capabilities within the project's constraints."},{"instruction":"Hey","output":"Hello!

Here are three possible translations for your sentence, each with an explanation for its naturalness among native Spanish speakers: 1. \\"De verdad, no estoy intentando evitarlo y no estoy siendo paranoico.\\" 2. \\"De verdad, no estoy tratando de evadirlo y no estoy siendo paranoico.\\" 3. \\"La verdad es que no estoy intentando salirme de esto y no estoy siendo paranoico.\\" Explanation for Each Translation: 1. **De verdad, no estoy intentando evitarlo y no estoy siendo paranoico.** This translation uses \\"de verdad\\" at the beginning to emphasize sincerity, much like saying \\"Honestly\\" or \\"For real\\" in English. \\"Evitarlo\\" translates directly to \\"avoid it,\\" which is a natural choice in Spanish for this context. Ending with \\"y no estoy siendo paranoico\\" directly communicates \\"and I'm not being paranoid,\\" preserving the original message. 2. **De verdad, no estoy tratando de evadirlo y no estoy siendo paranoico.** This version also starts with \\"de verdad,\\" ensuring the emphasis on honesty is clear. \\"Tratando de evadirlo\\" is another natural way to express trying to get out of something, where \\"evadirlo\\" is a verb that can mean to evade or to avoid, fitting the context well. The latter part remains unchanged because it's a straightforward translation that sounds natural in Spanish. 3. **La verdad es que no estoy intentando salirme de esto y no estoy siendo paranoico.** This option uses \\"La verdad es que\\" which is a common phrase for emphasizing truthfulness or sincerity, equivalent to saying \\"The truth is\\" in English. \\"Intentando salirme de esto\\" translates to \\"trying to get out of this,\\" which is a very idiomatic expression in Spanish for avoiding responsibilities or situations. The rest of the sentence is kept the same, as it directly conveys the intended meaning without sounding awkward. Each of these translations has considered not just the literal translation of words, but also the way natural speech patterns and expressions are used in Spanish. They convey sincerity and emphasize the speaker's intentions and feelings in a way that would be clear and familiar to native Spanish speakers."},{"instruction":"What does it mean by get out of it there?","output":"In the context of the phrase \\"ok I'm not trying to get out of it and I'm not being paranoid,\\" the expression \\"get out of it\\" typically means to avoid a responsibility, obligation, task, situation, or event. It carries the connotation of someone trying to find a way to not fulfill an obligation or participate in something they were expected to be a part of. The speaker is asserting they're not trying to avoid or shirk whatever it is they're supposed to engage with, and at the same time, they're reassuring the listener that their concerns are genuine and not due to paranoia. This phrase can be used in various contexts, such as work commitments, social events, or any other scenarios where someone is expected to contribute or participate."},{"instruction":"What’s good","output":"Hello!

They simultaneously function as both cushy hip armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing as armor, either; many of them are so thick they can be repurposed as blankets, pillows, even poofy mattresses! And not just diapers; other protective wear has been replaced with their similar infantile counterparts. Why wear tough greaves when you can wear soft booties? Why wear leather gloves when you can wear silky mittens? Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency and DC determined by the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of having accidents in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. Example 1: **Heavy-Duty Pamp of Poofing** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) *8 lbs., 240 gp, 2 tonnes capacity* While wearing this diaper, you can use your reaction to make a melee or ranged weapon attack made against you hit the diaper instead, softening the blow and reducing the damage to you by 1d10 (minimum of 1). As an action, you can speak the diaper's command word and cause it to create a cloud of powder around you. The cloud of powder covers a 20-foot cube, which becomes heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. This property can't be used until the next dawn. The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword. Example 2: **Huggies of Hotness** Armor (diaper), uncommon (requires attunement) *1.2 lbs., 55 gp, 400 lbs. capacity* You and your companions within 10 feet of you gain resistance to cold damage while you wear this diaper. This radius extends to 20 feet if you Load this diaper by an amount equal to half its capacity. If you hit with a weapon attack while attuned to this diaper, the attack deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. This pamp, branded in decals blue and purple flames, radiates a perpetual magical heat so potent the steam it constantly fumes melts snow and ice at the wearer's feet. Example 3: **Self-Locking Lavenders** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) *4 lb., 50 gp, 250 lbs. Load capacity* This diaper produces a pleasant scent when worn, which spreads to fill a 30-foot cube centred on you and prevents the diaper from stinking when you Load it. All creatures that can smell it have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. **Curse.** This item is cursed. Save for a small lock symbol imprinted upon the front, this diaper is otherwise identical to a heavy diaper. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or a *identify* spell reveals its curse. When you don this diaper, you can't doff it for 5d6 days or until you or the diaper is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While you are attuned to this diaper, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist pooping. If you already had disadvantage on this type of saving throw, you fail automatically.","output":"Given the context and requirements, here's a list of additional items for your imaginative and distinctive D&D homebrew setting: # 1. **Binky of Brave Babbling** *Wondrous item (pacifier), uncommon* **Effects:** While this pacifier is in your mouth, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks and Charisma saving throws.

They moved with a sense of urgency, knowing that the window to gather the remaining nectar was rapidly closing. The forest was a mosaic of gold, red, and brown, as if the trees themselves were encouraging the bees, shedding their bounty in preparation for winter's slumber.

Let my glow be a beacon, guiding you through these final harvest nights.\\" Night after night, the bees labored under the moon's watchful eye, their tiny bodies illuminated by its silver glow. They filled their hive with golden honey, the fruits of their summer-long labor, a precious commodity that would sustain them through the cold, barren months ahead. As the last leaf fell from the trees, signaling the end of autumn, the bees had amassed a treasure trove of honey. It glimmered under the hive's many facets, a testament to their hard work and dedication. The Queen, moved by her subjects' tireless efforts, addressed her kingdom with a heart full of gratitude, \\"My beloved subjects, your dedication has ensured our survival through the winter. Let us now take solace in the warmth of our hive and the sweetness of our honey. We have earned our rest under the watchful eye of our friend, the moon.\\" And so, as the first frost kissed the earth, the bees nestled deep within their hive, surrounded by the fruits of their labor. The moon, ever-vigilant, continued to shower them with its soft light, a silent guardian through the long winter nights. The cycle of nature had once again demonstrated its intricate balance, a dance of mutual respect and dependence. The bees, with their unwavering work ethic, and the moon, with its nurturing light, had forged a bond that transcended seasons. In the heart of the forest, life quietly celebrated the harmony of existence, waiting for the day when the snow would melt and the cycle would begin anew."},{"instruction":"Now create the remaining 4000 characters.","output":"As winter enveloped the forest in its icy embrace, the hive remained a bastion of warmth and community. Inside, life slowed down, but the spirit of the colony burned as bright as ever. The bees, now in their period of rest, huddled together, sharing the warmth their hard-earned honey provided. This was a time for stories, a time for reflecting on the past season's challenges and triumphs, and a time for the Queen to impart her wisdom to the next generation of workers and drones. The Queen, with a voice soft but clear, spoke of the ancient pact between the bees and the moon. She told tales of years when the moon's glow guided lost foragers back to the hive and of nights so bright, they worked as if under the sun. \\"The moon is our silent guardian,\\" she said, \\"a beacon in the darkness, guiding us, protecting us, reminding us that even in the deepest night, we are not alone.\\" As the Queen spoke, the moon itself seemed to listen, its light filtering through the tiny cracks of the hive, bathing the bees in a silvery glow. It was a magical scene, one that bridged the divide between day and night, summer and winter, work and rest. The bees listened intently, their young ones lulled into dreams of vibrant flowers and sunny skies, their hearts filled with hope for the future. Outside, the night was quiet, the usual chorus of forest life silenced by the snow. The moon, however, was more vibrant than ever, casting its light across the snowy landscape, making the world below glisten and sparkle. It was as if the moon was keeping watch, ensuring that the cold and the dark could not penetrate the warmth and light of the hive. In those long winter months, the moon and the bees remained intertwined in their dance of survival and sustenance. The bees depended on the honey, and the honey existed because of their hard work under the sun and the moon. The moon, in return, found purpose in its vigil over the forest and its creatures, a silent custodian of the night. As winter began to wane, the first signs of spring whispered promises of renewal. The snow melted, revealing the first tender shoots of green. The air warmed ever so slightly, and the forest stirred from its slumber. Inside the hive, the bees stirred too, sensing the changing season, their bodies and spirits rejuvenated by the rest and the stories of the winter months. The Queen, sensing the time had come, called her subjects to action. \\"The season of renewal is upon us,\\" she proclaimed. \\"Once more, we will venture into the world, to dance among the flowers and fill our hive with the promise of life. But let us never forget the lessons of the winter, the stories of our ancestors, and the light of our guardian moon.\\" And so, as the first rays of the spring sun warmed the earth, the bees poured out of the hive, a buzzing torrent of life and energy. They worked with a fervor that spoke of their rest and the tales that had fueled their dreams. Above them, the moon, now waning, watched over their flight, a silent companion as the cycle of nature turned once more. In this eternal cycle, the bees and the moon shared a bond that was both timeless and essential. It was a reminder that in the heart of nature, every creature, every element, plays a part in the grand design. The bees, with their ceaseless work and the moon, with its quiet vigil, stood as testaments to the beauty and resilience of life. As spring blossomed into summer, the forest once again became a symphony of colors and sounds, a celebration of life renewed. And at the heart of this celebration was the hive, the diligent bees, and the ever-watchful moon, each playing their part in the endless dance of existence."},{"instruction":"\\"Write the story of the hard-working bees in nature and the big brown bear who is preparing for hibernation and wants to steal honey from the bees.\\" Revision of this story. 8000 character prompt.

Because then you will create the next one with 4000 characters.","output":"In the heart of a sprawling forest, under the canopy of towering trees and amidst the chorus of nature's melody, there dwelled a hard-working community of bees. This vibrant colony, known for its diligence and unity, thrived in harmony with the rhythms of the forest. Their hive, a masterpiece of natural architecture, buzzed with life as the bees tirelessly gathered nectar, transforming it into the golden elixir that sustained them: honey. As summer gave way to autumn, the air crisp and the leaves ablaze with color, the forest inhabitants began their preparations for the coming winter. Among them was a big brown bear, his fur thick and his gait sluggish with the weight of impending hibernation. This bear, known to the forest dwellers for his gentle nature, harbored a deep-seated craving for the sweet luxury of honey. For him, no preparation for the long sleep was complete without the acquisition of this golden treasure. The bear, aware of the bees' hard work and the mutual respect that governed the forest's intricate web of life, struggled with his desire. He knew too well the importance of the bees' honey, not just as their food for the winter, but as a symbol of their labor and unity. Yet, the primal urge for honey tugged at his conscience, a battle between respect for his neighbors and the instinctive need to satiate his hunger. One crisp morning, as the sun cast a golden glow over the forest, the bear set out towards the hive. His steps were heavy, not just with the weight of his body, but with the weight of his decision. He approached the bees' home, hidden cleverly among the trees, its hum echoing softly in the silence of the dawn. The bees, busy with their work, noticed the shadow looming over their hive. Alarmed, they prepared to defend their home, for the hive was not just a store of their precious honey; it was their heart, the epicenter of their life and unity. The bear, standing before the hive, felt the weight of the gazes upon him. He spoke softly, his voice a deep rumble in the quiet forest. \\"Dear bees, I come before you torn by my needs and my respect for your hard work. Winter approaches, and my body calls for the sustenance only your honey can provide. Yet, I wish not to take without giving, for the forest teaches us the value of balance and harmony.\\" The bees, surprised by the bear's earnestness, convened with the Queen to deliberate this unusual request. The Queen, wise and fair, understood the bear's plight. She recognized the opportunity to strengthen the bonds within the forest's community, to turn a potential conflict into a lesson of cooperation and respect. After much discussion, the Queen addressed the bear, \\"Oh, big brown bear, your words have touched us, for they speak of respect and the cycles of nature we all obey. We propose a pact: in exchange for our honey, we ask for your protection during the harsh winter months. Predators lurk in the shadows, and your strength could guard us against those who might not respect the sanctity of our home.\\" The bear, moved by the bees' generosity and wisdom, agreed wholeheartedly. \\"I accept your offer and vow to be the guardian of your hive, to respect the balance of our existence and protect the fruits of your labor.\\" And so, a pact was forged between the bear and the bees, a testament to the forest's harmony. The bear, with a heart lightened by the resolution, savored the honey the bees offered. It was not just the sweetness of the honey that delighted him but the sweetness of unity and mutual respect. As winter cast its white blanket over the forest, the bear took his place beside the hive, a silent sentinel in the snow. The bees, nestled within their home, were warmed not just by their stores of honey but by the knowledge that their generosity had fostered goodwill and cooperation. The story of the bear and the bees spread throughout the forest, a tale of understanding and compromise. It reminded all forest dwellers of the delicate balance of nature, where every creature, regardless of size or strength, has a role in nurturing the web of life. And when the first buds of spring whispered promises of renewal, the bear awoke from his slumber, his first thought not of hunger, but of the bees. He ambled towards the hive, finding the bees already buzzing with activity, a new season of work ahead of them. In the heart of the forest, under the canopy of reborn trees, the bear and the bees stood together, a symbol of the harmony that arises when respect and understanding bridge the gap between differing worlds. And the forest hummed with life, a melody of unity, a testament to the balance that sustains the web of life."},{"instruction":"Now create the remaining 4000 characters.","output":"As spring unfurled its tender leaves and blossoms, the big brown bear and the bees reveled in the beauty of their flourishing partnership. With the bear's formidable presence safeguarding the hive, the bees ventured further afield than ever before, emboldened by the knowledge that their guardian watched over them. Their forays into the forest brought back not just nectar, but tales of the bear's kindness, spreading like pollen on the wind. The bear, for his part, found a new sense of purpose. No longer just a creature driven by the solitary instinct of survival, he was now a protector, a friend, a member of a community. The honey, as sweet as it was, tasted all the better for being a symbol of this newfound bond. He took his role seriously, patrolling the area around the hive, ensuring no creature dared to disturb the peace of his friends. But the true test of their pact came as the seasons turned, bringing with them the challenges of nature's cycle. A harsh summer arrived, drying rivers and wilting flowers. The bees, finding fewer blooms from which to gather nectar, grew anxious about their stores for the coming winter. The bear, witnessing their plight, remembered an old path he had once stumbled upon, a hidden valley where wildflowers bloomed in abundance, shielded from the scorching sun. With a deep sense of duty, the bear led the bees to the valley, guiding their flight with his imposing silhouette against the sky. The bees, amazed by the untouched beauty and bounty of the place, worked diligently to collect the precious nectar. When they returned to the hive, their stores replenished, they did so with a renewed sense of gratitude for their guardian. Autumn returned, painting the forest in fiery hues, a visual testament to the cycle of life and change. The bear felt the familiar call to prepare for hibernation, but this year, his preparation included ensuring the bees had enough supplies to last the winter. He helped them by carefully uncovering hidden caches of water and guiding them to late-blooming flowers. In return, the bees shared their honey, not just as sustenance for the bear's long sleep, but as a token of their enduring friendship. As the first frost kissed the forest, signaling the bear's time to retreat into his den, a solemn gathering took place near the hive. The bees, buzzing in a harmonious hum, bid farewell to their protector, promising to watch over his slumbering form as he had watched over their bustling home. The bear, with a heart full of warmth that no winter could chill, thanked his friends and made his way to the den under the cover of a starlit sky, his path lit by the glow of a grateful hive. Winter blanketed the forest in snow and silence, a serene pause in the unending cycle of seasons. Beneath the frozen surface, life whispered promises of resilience and renewal. The bear slept, his dreams filled with scenes of sunlit glades and the buzzing of bees. The bees, snug in their hive, crafted tales of their guardian bear, stories that would be told to generations yet to come, of how unity and kindness had woven a bond strong enough to weather any storm. When spring's gentle warmth nudged the bear from his slumber, he emerged into a world reborn. Flowers nodded their greetings, and the air thrummed with the news of his awakening. Making his way to the hive, he was met with a jubilant buzz. The bees, thriving and diligent as ever, welcomed him with an offering of the first honey of the season, a golden tribute to the cycle of friendship that wove through their lives as seamlessly as the seasons flowed one into another. In that moment, bear and bees stood together, a testament to the forest's enduring harmony, a harmony built on mutual respect, understanding, and an unspoken promise to protect and foster life in all its forms. And as the forest blossomed around them, their story, a legacy of unity and kinship, echoed in the heart of the wilderness, reminding all who heard it of the profound bonds that can flourish when the natural world is cherished and safeguarded."},{"instruction":"jj","output":"It seems like you've entered \\"jj,\\" which could mean several different things depending on the context.

They simultaneously function as both cushy hip armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing as armor, either; many of them are so thick they can be repurposed as blankets, pillows, even poofy mattresses! And not just diapers; other protective wear has been replaced with their similar infantile counterparts. Why wear tough greaves when you can wear soft booties? Why wear leather gloves when you can wear silky mittens? Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency and DC determined by the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of having accidents in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. Example 1: **Heavy-Duty Pamp of Poofing** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) *8 lbs., 240 gp, 2 tonnes capacity* While wearing this diaper, you can use your reaction to make a melee or ranged weapon attack made against you hit the diaper instead, softening the blow and reducing the damage to you by 1d10 (minimum of 1). As an action, you can speak the diaper's command word and cause it to create a cloud of powder around you. The cloud of powder covers a 20-foot cube, which becomes heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. This property can't be used until the next dawn. The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword. Example 2: **Huggies of Hotness** Armor (diaper), uncommon (requires attunement) *1.2 lbs., 55 gp, 400 lbs. capacity* You and your companions within 10 feet of you gain resistance to cold damage while you wear this diaper. This radius extends to 20 feet if you Load this diaper by an amount equal to half its capacity. If you hit with a weapon attack while attuned to this diaper, the attack deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. This pamp, branded in decals blue and purple flames, radiates a perpetual magical heat so potent the steam it constantly fumes melts snow and ice at the wearer's feet. Example 3: **Deluxe UltraLuxes** Wondrous item (diaper), very rare *1 lb., 600 gp, 80 lbs. capacity* While openly wearing this diaper, you can add double your proificeny bonus to all Charisma checks and saving throws if its clean. You have disadvantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws if you visibly Load this diaper by any amount. This opulent pamp is the height of diaper fashion, lined with rhinestones and adorned with sliver and gold embroideries; to stain it is to stain a piece of high infantile royalty. Example 4: **Self-Locking Lavenders** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) *4 lb., 50 gp, 250 lbs. Load capacity* This diaper produces a pleasant scent when worn, which spreads to fill a 30-foot cube centred on you and prevents the diaper from stinking when you Load it. All creatures that can smell it have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. **Curse.** This item is cursed. Save for a small lock symbol imprinted upon the front, this diaper is otherwise identical to a heavy diaper. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or a *identify* spell reveals its curse. When you don this diaper, you can't doff it for 5d6 days or until you or the diaper is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While you are attuned to this diaper, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist pooping. If you already had disadvantage on this type of saving throw, you fail automatically.","output":"# Diaper-Centric Loot and Equipment 1. **Babblestone Pacifier** Magic Item, uncommon *This magic pacifier grants the wearer advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would cause the conditions of being charmed or frightened. However, while in use, the wearer is unable to speak coherently, only able to produce baby-like babbling noises.* 2. **Rattler of Distraction** Magic Item, uncommon *A bejeweled baby rattle that, when shaken as an action, forces enemies within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw or become distracted, granting advantage on the next attack against them. Usable once per short rest.* 3. **Mittens of Missive Blocking** Armor (mittens), rare *These plush mittens grant the wearer resistance to frost damage and immunity to effects that would cause their hands to be bound or magically stuck. However, dexterity-based skill checks requiring the use of fingers suffer a disadvantage.* 4. **Booties of Boundless Steps** Wondrous Item, rare *These soft, oversized booties double the wearer's jumping distance and height, and also protect against damage from falling up to 20 feet. However, the squishy nature of the booties imposes a -10 penalty to stealth due to the loud, squeaky noises they make with each step.* 5. **Eternal Bottle of Hydration** Magic Item, uncommon *This baby bottle never runs empty, always refilling with fresh, clean water. Drinking from the bottle requires an action and restores a small amount of HP in addition to quenching thirst. It is said to be a relic from a civilization that revered eternal youth.* 6. **Bulky Blanket of Comfort** Magic Item, rare *This thick, diaper-material blanket can wrap around the wearer to provide resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against sleep and paralysis. However, while wrapped in the blanket, the wearer's speed is halved.* 7. **Roll of Refined Wipes** Adventuring Gear, common *A necessity for any adventurer, this roll of magical wipes cleans any surface or object spotlessly with a single swipe, including the most heavily loaded diapers. Contains 100 uses.* 8. **Giant Pin of Piercing** Weapon (improvised, shortsword), uncommon *A giant safety pin that can function as a shortsword with a twist: upon a successful hit, it can attempt to pin the target's gear to their body, requiring them to spend their next action removing the pin instead of attacking.* 9. **Cap of Cuddly Command** Magic Item, very rare *This soft, velvet baby cap grants the wearer the ability to cast \\"Dominate Monster\\" once per day on creatures classified as Beasts. However, the creature must be of a kind that could be seen as \\"cute\\" or \\"cuddly\\" by the typical person's standards.* 10. **Tunics of Toddling** Armor (chest), uncommon *These oversized tunics grant the wearer an extra layer of protection by poofing out and cushioning blows. Provides an additional +1 to AC but reduces Dexterity by 1 due to its cumbersome bulk.* These items incorporate the unique cultural and societal norms of the setting into traditional gameplay mechanics while maintaining balance and the spirit of adventure."},{"instruction":"напиши от моего лица как хорошо проводить время с друзьями в молодости","output":"Способы хорошо провести время с друзьями в молодости многогранны и зависят от личных интересов, вкусов и возможностей, но одно остается неизменным – это несравненное чувство радости, свободы и близости, которое приносят эти моменты.

Наслаждение жизнью в студенческие годы для меня заключается в целом ряде особенностей, которые делают это время таким особенным. Во-первых, это учеба. Да, действительно учеба. Я осознаю, что получаемые знания и навыки откроют передо мной двери в будущее, поэтому я стремлюсь не только хорошо учиться, но и искать интересные проекты и курсы, которые расширят мои горизонты и дадут возможность сделать что-то значимое уже сейчас. Во-вторых, времена студенчества – это время встреч с новыми людьми. Я стараюсь общаться с людьми из разных культур и социальных групп. Это не только расширяет мой кругозор, но и дает множество новых друзей, а порой и будущих профессиональных контактов. В-третьих, я не упускаю возможность участвовать в студенческих мероприятиях и организациях. Помимо новых знакомств, это отличные возможности для развития командных и лидерских навыков, которые пригодятся в дальнейшей жизни. Четвертый аспект – путешествия. Студенческие годы – это идеальное время для исследования новых стран и культур, особенно с доступными студенческими скидками. Путешествия позволяют не только расслабиться и получить незабываемые впечатления, но и взглянуть на мир под другим углом. И, наконец, я стараюсь просто радоваться каждому моменту.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. formula for the stats adjustments for both Sapphire and Lily: new stats = new age / initial age x stats from previous round. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points. Add a list of 3 epic spells that require super high stats. Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","output":"# Pre-Duel Setup Sapphire's Initial Stats (Age 16): - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 Lily's Initial Stats (Age 6): - Spell Power: 30 - Performance: 40 # Spell Lists Sapphire's Spells: 1. **Aurora Veil** (SP: 90, Points: 120) - A spell that creates a shimmering aurora in the sky. 2. **Celestial Dance** (SP: 85, Points: 110) - Summons ethereal dancers that perform in the air. 3. **Whispering Winds** (SP: 80, Points: 100) - Generates a gentle, musical breeze. 4. **Crystal Cascade** (SP: 75, Points: 90) - A waterfall of luminescent crystals forms from thin air. 5. **Ephemeral Blossoms** (SP: 70, Points: 80) - Causes delicate flowers to bloom instantly on the ground. 6. **Mirror Lake** (SP: 65, Points: 70) - Creates a reflective pool that shows the sky above. 7. **Glittering Gales** (SP: 60, Points: 60) - A storm of glittering particles swirls around. 8. **Butterfly Swarm** (SP: 55, Points: 50) - Summons a beautiful array of magical butterflies. 9. **Moonlit Serenade** (SP: 50, Points: 40) - A soft, haunting melody fills the air, coming from nowhere. 10. **Starlight Spark** (SP: 20, Points: 30) - Tiny stars light up around Sapphire.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"-Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania MOTTO: \\"All Hail the Earth!\\" CAPITAL: Leviticus City (formerly San Francisco) LARGEST CITY: Exodus (formerly London) AREA: 13 star systems POPULATION: 190 billion RELIGION; Christianity OFFICIAL LANGUAGES: English DEMONYM: Kalgamanian GOVERNMENT: Imperialist Absolute Monarchy LEGISLATURE: Kalgamanian Royal Family FOUNDED: December 26, 2030 GDP: 495 trillion CURRENCY: Pounds The **Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania**, also known as the **Holy Empire of Kalgamania** or just **Kalgamania**, was a global and interstellar superpower that ruled the entire Earth along with countless planets in twelve other star systems from 2030 to 2102. It was a far-right imperialist power infamous for its rampant state- and corporate-sponsored bigotry and its ruthless principles of Social Darwinism. Its ruling powers believed that humans were a superior race and that all other sentient civilizations were \\"backwards\\" and \\"primitive\\". It conquered numerous exoplanets and subjected any native inhabitants to apartheid and discrimination. Eventually, rebels from one of its colony worlds, Uingffh, overthrew the empire in 2102. In addition to its speciesism, Kalgamania was also known to discriminate against minorities within the human race as well. The upper classes were predominantly white or white-passing cisgender, neurotypical men. Church and state were not separate and prosecution of other religious faiths as well as members of the LGBTQ+ community was common, with bible verses such as Leviticus 18:22 being used to justify these acts. Neurodivergent people such as autistics and those with ADHD were also looked down upon, with many of Kalgamania's social norms directly going against common neurodivergent traits. Kalgamania's capital was Leviticus City, which despite the country's European roots is located in what was once the Bay Area region of what used to be the U.S. state of California. It was notable for containing an immense three kilometer-long ring-shaped palace which served as the home of the empire's royal family. ~~History ~Pre-interstellar era and Kalgamanian Revolution (2030-2040) Before Kalgamania had been established, humanity was in disarray due to numerous natural calamities like climate change and a group of extremely powerful hurricanes in 2027 including one that severely affected the global climate and destroyed large portions of the North American Continent. With many nations collapsing or on the verge of doing so, conditions were ripe for an extremist government to take power, as many citizens started blaming moderate ideologies like liberalism and conservatism for the state of the Earth and began looking towards more radical ideologies. This was enhanced by the fact that Generation Z, which was known for being predominantly far-left, was now old enough to begin taking positions of power. Eventually, a group of seven English politicians began promoting an ideology they called Kalgamania in 2028. In stark contrast to the overall leftist political atmosphere of the Earth at the time, Kalgamania was very far right and blamed minority groups such as people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women who did not abide by traditonal gender norms, etc. for the chaos. Through use of unusually powerful arms as well as a massive propaganda campaign, Kalgamania was able to become the dominant party on Earth and was eventually founded as a nation on December 26, 2030. However, this was not without the deaths of nearly a billion people in the process. The politicians who had formed the nation seated themselves as Kalgamania's royal family and turned the nation into an absolute monarchy. The process of Kalgamania rising to power would become known as the Kalgamanian Revolution. The unusual power of Kalgamania's technology has driven conspiracy theories that the founders were being assisted by aliens or were performing supernatural rituals, but the government has repeatedly driven down these statements with the simple notion that their technological advancements were because of \\"the everlasting greatness of the human race.\\" The flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carried some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. ~Peaceful interstellar era (2040-2084) After the empire was founded, the royal family pushed for rapid technological development in order to recover from the ruin caused by the natural disasters. To this end, the Kalgamanian royal family decided to decrease their influence slightly and breed free-market capitalism with the promise that successful businessmen would become nobles of the empire and be granted special privileges. This effort turned out to be successful, with humanity becoming capable of commercial interplanetary travel by 2035 and with many colonies being set up on Mars, the Moon, and moons of the outer giant planets. However, classism became rampant as a side effect of this, adding on to the already severe bigotry towards other minorities. To quell rebellions, Kalgamania developed its already powerful military and used it against dissent. By 2040, Kalgamania had discovered a wormhole in the outer fringes of the solar system that led to the star system of Gliese 105. Humanity sent a ship named the Voyager III into the wormhole and discovered numerous alien races in the system (which they called Ingffhaestia), including those of Uingffh. Despite Kalgamania's xenophobic tendencies, they were friendly towards the aliens and even established a colony on Uingffh called Neo Gaia in 2050. Ingffhaestia and Kalgamania lived in relative peace as the two shared information about their biology and cultures. However, tensions arose in 2075 when the two began learning more about their respective political ideologies. Ingffhaestia did not condone Kalgamania's acts of discrimination and its capitalist system while Kalgamania became opposed to Ingffhaestia due to Ingffhaestia being socialist, which went directly against Kalgamania's principles. This would soon escalate into outright war in 2084. ~Colonial interstellar era (2085-2098) [An illustration of Rinelia su Kalgamania, the empress of Kalgamania at the time Kalgamania invaded Ingffhaestia. Its illustrator was later executed upon coming out as bisexual.] In 2085, Kalgamania, with its highly advanced technology born out of worker abuse and slave labor, easily won the war against Ingffhaestia in 2085, subsequently placing every planet in Ingffhaestia under its control. Kalgamania transitioned into a colonial power similar to European nations during the 1800's and 1900's and began extending its discriminatory policies towards Ingffhaestian species with the justification that humans were genetically superior and Ingffhaestian aliens inferior. Ingffhaestians were barred from participating in Kalgamanian society and were either sent to concentration camps for experimentation, were forced to work in unhealthy conditions 24/7 for one of the empire's many private businesses, or were simply executed. Entire families were separated and children as young as newborns were murdered. Propaganda was set up that portrayed member species of the now-fallen Ingffhaestian Federation as evil and blasphemous while history classes were forced to give biased information pertaining to why non-humans were not to be trusted. Invasive earth species were introduced to many worlds that led to the extinction of millions of native alien life. Nationalism also became rampant, with Kalgamanian flags being held up in almost every public place and schools being forced to give patriotic education. After Ingffhaestia was conquered, Kalgamania began invading numerous other star systems after inventing wormhole-generating devices. A total of eleven other solar systems became colonized by the empire, which were each represented by an added star to the Kalgamanian flag. Any native species inhabiting these systems were subjected to the same discriminatory practices used on the Ingffhaestians. Humanity even invented weapons called world glassers which had the ability to burn the surface of whole continents and were used to put down any opposition against the royal family or the noble corporations. ~~Government Earth-Kalgamania is an absolute monarchy composed of a royal family which wields almost absolute power over their empire. Royals have the ability to execute people, pass laws, etc. at ease with very little restrictions. Ordinary citizens have little say in their government's affairs. The head of the family is a single emperor or empress whose power trumps even other royal family members. Emperors stay in power until they die or they voluntarily resign, though resignation is highly looked down upon and is seen as a sign of weakness. The royal family is divided up into seven houses representing each of the seven founders of Kalgamania. In order from most powerful to least powerful, they are the Houses of Su, Inv, Ir, Ace, Av, Gul, and Lux. Royal family members have his/her (the use of him or her rather than them is intentional, as non-binary people were forbidden to have positions of power in the empire and any royal family member found out to be non-binary was executed) house name as their middle name and \\"Kalgamania\\" as his/her last name. For example, Rinelia su Kalgamania is a member of the House of Su and thus carries the middle name of su. All middle names are in lowercase. In addition to the royal family, wealthy businessmen also have considerable political power. Many of them are nobles appointed by the emperor, and advertisements for their respective companies are just as common and widespread as government propaganda. However, the royal family still carries more political power than businessmen and has the ability to restrict their influence at will, especially if their ideas go against that of Kalgamania. Every colony planet/moon has one governor-general assigned to it who rules over the world on behalf of the emperor's. Governor-generals can only be appointed by the emperor him/herself and are usually members of the royal family, though some governor-generals are prominent businessmen with no genetic ties to the royal bloodline. ~Order of succession When an emperor dies or resigns, the person who will be the next emperor is determined by age and house. The next person in line to become emperor of Kalgamania is usually the oldest person in the House of Su. If all members of the House of Su are deceased or exiled, then the oldest member of the House of Inv will become emperor in accordance to the order of most powerful royal houses, followed by the next oldest in Inv. If all members of the House of Inv are also dead, then the oldest in the House of Ir will become emperor and so on. In the rare case that every member of the royal family is killed, a nobleman will be selected at random to become emperor. At least one member of the House of Su was alive throughout the entirety of Kalgamania's history, so none of these measures have ever been taken. Anyone who is crowned emperor automatically gains \\"su\\" as a middle name and becomes new head of the House of Su regardless of whether or not he/she was part of the House of Su beforehand. ~List of Rulers Over Kalgamania's 72-year history, the empire saw a total of three emperors. All three were part of the same bloodline and are listed below. List of Kalgamanian emperors Name|Period of Rule|Notes Nathan su Kalgamania|December 26, 2030 - November 11, 2052|Founder of Kalgamania Odysseus su Kalgamania|November 14, 2052 - October 8, 2084|Died from assassination; likely culprit is Rinelia Rinelia su Kalgamania|October 20, 2084 - September 20, 2102|First female ruler; took power after the death of her father Odysseus (which was likely her doing) ~~Economy Despite the controlling and totalitarianist nature of Kalgamania, the empire's economy is primarily capitalist. Private individuals control most means of production and are allowed to build companies with very little restrictions, with the only justification for restricting a company's rights being if they express direct opposition towards the royal family. Workers' rights are disregarded and entrepreneurs are allowed to pay their employees as little as they like, set as many work hours as they like, and even execute workers. Businessmen carry a large amount of influence on Kalgamanian politics and culture and carry similar privileges to royal family members. Advertisements for their companies are widespread and are just as, if not more common than government propaganda. Particularly successful entrepreneurs are often granted noble status by the emperor. As a result of this capitalist economy, Kalgamania is highly advanced technologically, but everyday citizens live largely in poverty. Communism and its flaws are often used as fear tactics by both the royal family and companies to keep the general population loyal to Kalgamania despite their poor living conditions. Helping the poor is looked at with disdain and poverty is seen as simply the result of failure on the poor's part - an extension of the overall Social Darwinist nature of the empire. ~~Culture Kalgamanian culture has a large emphasis on tradition. Many aspects of European culture, such as the use of English as the dominant language, pounds being used as currency, etc. are found in Kalgamania. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire, but only in their traditional European forms (e.g. baroque and classical music, realistic art, and classical literature). Cultural works from the modern era (cartoon/anime art, modern literature, rap/pop music, etc.) and from other cultures are looked down upon, though there are some cases of them being successful. Despite this, Kalgamania has highly advanced technology which is celebrated by both the general populace and the nobility/royalty. Social norms, keeping order, survival of the fittest (Social Darwinism), and an aversion to things perceived as abnormal play a large role in Kalgamanian society and are largely tied in with its traditional values. This unfortunately also means that discrimination against minorities is widespread, with bigotry having a powerful influence on Kalgamanian society. Derogatory slurs such as nigger, faggot, dyke, retard, etc. are are often thrown around by both the youth and even mature adults. ~Sexism Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Kalgamania. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Kalgamanian law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Kalgamanian society and was banned in the empire. Despite these social norms, several women existed who carry high positions in Kalgamanian society, though they were mostly royalty and still discriminated against other minority groups. The last emperor/empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania was female: Rinelia su Kalgamania. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. ~Ableism Extroversion, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, introversion, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as \\"unusual\\" hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Kalgamania contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. \`Homophobia Homophobia was commonplace in Kalgamania due to the empire's Christian roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Kalgamania's version of Christianity. Same-gender relationships were illegal and gay people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. Businessmen were allowed to fire workers on the basis of their sexuality. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Kalgamanian law. Gay couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. The words gay and homosexual were often used as insults. ~Biphobia Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Kalgamanian society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like gay people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. ~Aphobia Asexual and aromantic people were targeted by the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania in addition to bisexuals and homosexuals. Because it was considered Kalgamanians' duty to have a partner and raise a family, those who did not experience sexual or romantic attraction were looked down upon and treated in similar ways to bisexuals and homosexuals. Many asexuals and aromantics were forced to have sex or enter unwanted romantic relationships, which was worsened by the fact that sexual assault was fully condoned by the empire. ~Transphobia Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community: with oppression. Kalgamania saw gender and sex as one and the same; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Kalgamanian youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. ~Racism Continuing with the Social Darwinist trend of the empire, white Kalgamanians saw themselves as superior to people of color. Lynching and beating of people of color were commonplace and Black, Asian, etc. culture was suppressed. Having hairstyles indicative of people of color, like afros and dreadlocks, was punishable by indefinite imprisonment until the offender chooses to cut his/her hair to something more acceptable by Kalgamanian standards. Racial stereotypes were frequently seen in Kalgamanian media such as exaggeratedly narrow eyes in Asian characters and the notion of Black people liking watermelons. Non-European cultures were highly stereotyped and misrepresented. ~Religious discrimination People who preached faiths other than Christianity were fiercely condemned by Earth-Kalgamania. Jews, muslims, etc. were often incarcerated by the state or businesses and were tortured in order to get them to convert to Christianity. Corporations did not give accommodations to people who needed to observe religious holidays and traditions for important times of the year like Hanukkah and Ramadan were disrespected and ignored. Even atheists were subject to prejudice by the holy empire and were pressured by peers, the government, etc. to become Christian. -Antisemitism Kalgamanians were allowed to freely display Nazi symbols and other anti-Jewish symbols. Jewish stereotypes were rampant in the media and antisemitic ideas were woven into education. The construction of synagogues was forbidden by Kalgamanian law and any synagogue built was to be demolished and its builders executed. -Islamophobia People were forbidden to wear hijabs both in public and in private. Schools and media taught children that muslims were anti-Kalgamania terrorists and not to be trusted. Like with Jews and other religious minorities, muslims were frequently blamed for any misfortune that occurs in the Holy Kalgamanian Empire. ~Ageism Though not directly present in Kalgamanian laws, discrimination against both the elderly and the young was common. Elderly people whose old age inhibited their supposed usefulness in Kalgamanian society were murdered by hospitals similarly to disabled people. Young people were painted as selfish, naive, and unfit to have a say in important issues even if they show consistently mature behavior. ~Classism Due to the Earth-Kalgamanian Empire being a highly capitalist and consumerist country, classism was common. Poverty was widespread in Kalgamanian colonies and the lower social classes lived in conditions comparable to those other minorities lived in. Kalgamanians are taught that poverty is the fault of the poor themselves despite the fact that businessmen hoarding money and abusing workers was the main cause of poverty. ~Speciesism Speciesism was one of the most prominent forms of bigotry influencing Kalgamanian culture. New slurs made out of the names of alien species were frequent. For example, members of the tabulon race, the native species of Uingffh and Urlum/the Seraph's species, were referred to by the derogatory word tabbie. Species also experienced derogatory comparisons to fictional alien species in Earth pop culture such as the Wookies from Star Wars, the Vulcans from Star Trek, and the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar. Much like with the poor, people are taught that the cruel treatment of aliens is justified by the notion that the humans won fairly and that they are free to do what they want with those they defeated. Schools were also forced to teach that aliens were inherently evil and dangerous. Most media featuring aliens portrayed the aliens in a negative and heavily stereotyped manner. Many propaganda posters depict aliens doing traditionally immoral deeds, sometimes with a conventionally attractive human doing good deeds for comparison. ~Nationalism Nationalism and patriotism have a large influence over culture in the empire. Kalgamanian children are taught to display their utmost loyalty to their nation. Even their birth certificates contain a Kalgamanian flag and the motto of \\"All hail the Earth!\\" on their corners. Kalgamanian flags can often be seen on city streets and it is national law to display a Kalgamanian flag in front of every household. Propaganda against aliens is commonplace. All classes are forced to recite the following pledge while facing the flag before resuming normal learning activities: *\\"I pledge my loyalty, my strength, and my wisdom to the Emperor, to Earth, to humanity, and to God. And to our almighty fatherland - the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania, a perfect nation, blessed by the Lord, undefeatable, which shall spread order and stability across the universe. All hail Kalgamania! All hail the Earth! All hail humanity!”* All classes are from a patriotic viewpoint and contain anti-alien propaganda weaved into their lessons. The Kalgamanian military is glorified and many films about its victories exist. Furthermore, television channels frequently broadcast advertisements encouraging or even guilt-tripping citizens into joining the armed forces. ~Individualism and Social Darwinism [An old political comic originally created before Kalgamania rose which is now used frequently by the empire. Original source unknown.] Despite the controlling nature of Earth-Kalgamania's ruling powers, individualism is a strongly valued concept in the country. However, it has been twisted in a way that breeds entitlement and toxicity as opposed to genuine freedom. Individualism only exists for privileged groups (white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, male, human, etc.) and freedom is used as a justification for bigoted beliefs. The belief of Social Darwinism is perpetuated in the empire and life is seen as survival of the fittest. Victim blaming is very common and people who do immoral acts towards others are given leeway in the Kalgamanian judicial system unless their acts go against Kalgamanian philosophy. People undergoing struggle are told to simply get over their issues regardless of whether doing so is actually feasible or not. Asking for help from others is looked down upon as a sign of weakness. This sense of individualism often influences Kalgamanian bigotry such as transgender people being told to just accept the bodies they were born in, the poor being blamed for their own poverty, toxic masculinity, rape culture, etc. ~National Flower [Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii is the national flower of the Kalgamanian Empire.] The national flower of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania is Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii, a breed of Agapanthus praecox. The plant is known for its long stalks containing large umbels of small bell-shaped flowers whose purple color is likened to that of the Kalgamanian flag, which is why it was named the national flower of the Empire. Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii can be found in numerous places such as in front of businesses, in parking lots, and more in Leviticus City and other Mediterranean climates due to the plant being fit for warm areas. They are also known to be popular garden plants, as they do not require much maintenance. However, they are considered a nuisance to citizens of the Empire (particularly amongst the lower social classes) due to the agapanthuses invading local ecosystems as well as because their strong roots often damage concrete. They are infamous among aliens as being representative of the destruction of their homeworlds' ecosystems due the fact that thousands of square kilometers of alien wildlife were harmed by invasive Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii specimens. By 2103, Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii was banned from existing on alien planets and all plants of the breed were seen as weeds and pulled, though they continue to exist in large numbers on Earth. ~~Religion Kalgamania's dominant religion is Christianity, which is reflected in the references to God in the Kalgamanian pledge. Christianity is weaved into many of the policies and laws of the empire and separation of church and state is nonexistent, which is seen in how Earth-Kalgamania is referred to as a 'holy' empire. The Bible is often used as a justification for Kalgamania's strict policies of discrimination; for example, its law of forbidding same-sex relationships uses Leviticus 18:22 (\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\\") as its justification. People of other faiths or who are atheist are encouraged to convert to Christianity. The pope and other high-ranking members of the Christian Church carry power comparable to that of businessmen and royalty. Kalgamanians celebrate Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though like in the real world, they have largely been turned into tools used by entrepreneurs to increase sales. ~\`Military Kalgamania's military is known as the Holy Kalgamanian Armed Forces (HKAF). They are among one of the most powerful militaries and carry numerous pieces of advanced technology. Their soldier numbers amount in the billions and they own millions of tanks, guns, planes, and spaceships. Laser technology is heavily utilized by Kalgamania in its military endeavors. ~World glassers One of the most infamous and feared weapons of the HKAF is the world glasser, a kilometer-long spaceship with the ability to soil entire landmasses by concentrating nuclear charges in a fashion similar to the Casaba-Howitzer Project. Though the Juprits-class world glasser is the main type of world glasser, other world glasser variants exist, albeit they are used sparingly and rarely. A total of ten world glasser types, including the Juprits, were built by Kalgamania. [The Juprits-Class World Glasser. 1.9 kilometers long, it was the standard model of world glasser used by Kalgamania. It had two cannons which could fire lasers with the ability to destroy a city.] [The Juperius-Class World Glasser was a slight improvement on the Juprits' design, being 2.5 kilometers long and bearing four cannons instead of two.] [The Courageous-Class Heavy World Glasser was another heavy world glasser. Being 6 km long, it carried only two world-glassing cannons, but they were both more powerful than that of the Trident and could create explosions the size of Texas.] [The Trident-Class Heavy World Glasser was the first in a line of three larger world glasser classes called heavy world glassers. 4 km long, the Trident was actually two ships attached to each other. The Trident carried four cannons, two for each ship, which can each destroy an area the size of a small country or U.S. state.] [The Privilege-Class was the first of a line of even larger world glassers called Super World Glassers. It was 8 km long and carried eight cannons whose lasers can destroy large countries or even landmasses.] [The Catalyst-Class, a variation of the Courageous. The Catalyst lacks the large spar and underside structures on the bottom of a normal Courageous, making it much more agile in combat.] [The Oppressor-Class Super World Glasser was an even larger super world glasser that was 10 km long. It carried 12 cannons compared to the Privilege's measly eight. Its two towers on the top could fire potent lasers of their own which could eliminate enemy ships with ease in addition to the ship's numerous other guns.] [The Absolute-Class Super World Glasser was the largest of the super world glassers, being 12.5 km in length. This ship class carried two towers on top which had the ability to let out pulses. These pulses could temporarily disable enemy ships, ensuring an easy victory.] [The Empyrean-Class was the largest and most powerful world glasser in the whole HKAF, being described as a hyper world glasser. The Empyrean was 15 km long and has the ability to decimate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it uninhabitable for centuries. Only one Empyrean was built, and it was used as the flagship of Rinelia.] [The Heartless-Class Super World Glasser was a reactionary redesign of the super world glasser when it was found that the city-like structures at the top of super world glassers could be used by fighter planes as cover. The Heartless solves this issue by having its cityscape covered, depriving fighters of the ability to hide in them. The Heartless was 10 km long and contained a single but powerful cannon.] ~Gliese Indigenous Police One of the most well-known parts of the military was the Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP), a police force stationed in Gliese 105. Though its purpose was as a general police force for helping the populace, its main task was oppressing native alien races and keeping their power in check. Video footage of the GIP brutally beating or even murdering natives exists online. One particular beating, the murder of tabulon Catalystia Floraze through chokehold, gained widespread media attention and began a social movement known as Tabulon Lives Matter (TLM), which was later expanded to Protect Indigenous Aliens (PIA) as more and more Kalgamanian citizens realized the flaws of their government. Both of these movements paved the way for the Seraphim Rebellion. ~~Demographics Though the term \\"Kalgamanian\\" technically refers to any human loyal to Kalgamania, it is usually only used to the 99.2% of the human population that is of European descent. Only 0.8% of all Kalgamanian citizens are people of color due to ethnic cleansing and racism. ~~Geographics Though beginning in Europe, Kalgamnia's territory quickly expanded to include all of Earth's land area after conquering all other countries in existence. At its peak, the empire also controlled the entire Solar System along with twelve other star systems all within 50 light-years of Earth. All of these territories except Earth were later lost when the Seraph rebelled and dismantled Earth-Kalgamania in 2102. ~List of colonies * = habitable world >Solar System >>Mercury >>Venus >>Earth* (Capital of the Empire) >>Mars >>Jupiter >>Saturn >>Uranus >>Neptune >Alpha Centauri A System >>Alva >>Blalo* >>Orus >Alpha Centauri B System >>Kaith >>Cale >>Syro >Proxima Centauri >>Iro >>Narath* >>Sian >>Ernus >Cervantes (Mu Arae) System >>Dulcinea >>Rocinante >>>Paleo* >>Quijote >>>Neo* >>Sancho >Ran (Epsilon Eridani) System >>Odin >>Thoriam >>>Epaphus* >>Aegir >>Tias >Apollo (HD 219134) System >>Hephaestus >>Aphrodite >>Nereus >>Aura >>Penthesileia >>Ares* >>Cardea >>>Dionysus* >>Aeolus >>>Achlys* >Tabaldak (Epsilon Indi) System >>Dzeedzeebonda* >>Gluskab* >>Bmda >>Chibaiskweda >>Azeban/Tsinoo (Binary Planet) >Chawalan (47 Ursae Majoris) System >>Phi Phong >>Pret >>Nang Tan* >>Taphao Thong >>>Kuman Thong* >>Taphao Khew >>Phosop >TRAPPIST-1 System >>Holland >>Helsbergen >>Hennendal >>Alicanto >>Payachata* >>Llorona* >>Tirana >Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) System >>Firades >>Lavaria >>Shoji >>Coppelius >>>Uingffh* >>Saringffh* >>Ibiridius* >>>Muulforia* >>>Yangteon* >>>Cornelia* >>>Gabolar* >>Azure >>Fillonia >>Halmonia >>Golmia >>Hege >>Xong >>Ajooni >>Digrazia >Avimotalis System >>Onaut >>Narva >>Exicle >>Bor* >>Kitanis >>>Lelantos* >>>Durus* >>>Nides >>Pronos >>Sriaturn >Heranis System >>Lurmes >>Ilsadite >>Sahariana* >>Rasaidor* >>Florazia* >>Olympia* >>Pluma >>Augustus >>Ardollo >>Jasper >>Transolia ~~Flag As mentioned previously, the flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carries some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. The twelve stars on the diagonal stripes represent each of the twelve star systems conquered by the empire. -Rinelia su Kalgamania Rinelia su Kalgamania 3rd Empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania In office: October 20, 2084 - December 26, 2099 Predecessor: Odysseus su Kalgamania (father) Successor: N/A (last empress; Kalgamania dissolved following end of rule) Personal Information Partner: None Children: None Father: Odysseus su Kalgamania (2nd Emperor of Kalgamania) Mother: Penelope su Kalgamania Born: December 26, 2074, Leviticus City Died: December 26, 2099 (age 25), Leviticus City Religion: Catholicism Rinelia su Kalgamania (December 26, 2074 - December 26, 2099) was the third and final empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania (LVL's Urlum the Usurper) as well as Kalgamania's first female ruler. Taking the throne at a record young age of 9 following the murder of her parents and former rulers Odysseus and Penelope (allegedly at her own hands) su Kalgamania, Rinelia ruled the Holy Kalgamanian Empire from 2084 to 2099, when she was ousted from power by Urlum Eudae Kaywell during the Seraphim Rebellion of 2099. Rinelia was responsible for the conquest of the Ingffhaestian System and the transformation of Kalgamania into an interstellar power. As empress, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and was infamous for conducting oppressive policies towards minority groups including people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, political dissidents, etc. She was also a devout Catholic and took part in the religious persecution of countless religious minorities. However, her most notable act was the invasion of the Ingffhaestian Federation a year after she began her rule; during and after the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Rinelia closely involved herself in the brutal subjugation and oppression of Ingffhaestia's various alien races, whom she and her human subjects viewed as genetically inferior to them. She reportedly died on December 26, 2099 after being executed by the Seraph, leader of the Seraphim Rebellion which rose to oppose her rule. ~~Early Life Rinelia su Kalgamania was born the daughter of Emperor Odysseus su Kalgamania and his wife Penelope on December 26, 2074 along with her twin brother Lenelius su Kalgamania. Though not much is known about Rinelia's childhood due to censorship, most sources agree that Rinelia and Lenelius had a somewhat mischievous, but overall close and loving relationship and that she lived a luxurious, extravagant lifestyle in the palace. It is also known that as a child, she consumed large amounts of fictional works containing anti-Ingffhaestia rhetoric including literature; her parents looked down upon other children Rinelia's age who used modern technology such as cell phones or television, raising her in a very traditional and authoritative manner. Initially, Rinelia's older brother Telemachus su Kalgamania was the next in-line for the throne. However, anti-Kalgamanian rebels staged a bombing which killed Telemachus in 2082, resulting in heated disputes over whether Rinelia or her brother would ascend to the throne. On October 20, 2084, all members of the House of Su except Rinelia were found dead in the Leviticus City Imperial Palace, leaving Rinelia as the sole candidate for ruler. She was crowned that day as Third Empress of Kalgamania at the age of 9 years old, the youngest on record. Though unconfirmed, many historians now agree that Rinelia had executed her family herself in order to become Empress. ~~Empress As Empress, Rinelia's rule was aided by a council of royal advisors due to her young age. However, the Empress frequently bribed or threatened her advisors in order to get her ways. Following her father as well as her grandfather Nathan su Kalgamania's footsteps, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and executed all who opposed her rule. ~Ingffhestia-Kalgamania War Vehemently opposing the Ingffhaestian Federation even during childhood, Rinelia's first move as Empress was to declare war on Ingffhaestia on October 31, 2084. The Empress ordered weapon manufacturing companies to significantly increase production of spaceships and space weapons for the war by forcing employees to work 24 hours as part of her Interstellar Militarization Act (IMA). This led to several strikes and protests among workers viewing their employers' policies as exploitative; Rinelia quickly put these revolts down by force while denouncing the worker protests as \\"degeneracy on the level of those Ingffhaestian retards.\\" A total of 17,329 workers died as a result of armed enforcement of the IMA. ~~CONTENT BELOW YET TO BE REVAMPED With military production bolstered by the exploitation of workers, Kalgamania was able to procure thousands of state-of-the-art spacecraft and weaponry, including the infamous world glasser, which Rinelia immediately sent into service in the war against Ingffhaestia. They quickly overpowered the Ingffhaestian Federation's forces. On January 16, 2085, the Ingffhaestian Federation surrendered to Kalgamanian rule after its capital, the city of Yang-Moof on Planet Uingffh, was threatened to be destroyed by a shot from a world glasser. The Empress made a public statement that day blaming the Ingffhaestians' loss on their supposed genetic inferiority, proclaiming humans as a superior race. She also blamed the Ingffhaestians' emphasis on peace, stating that \\"peace is the catalyst of weakness\\" and that \\"the greatest strength comes from the greatest wars.\\" ~Colonization of Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) Following the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Empress Rinelia appointed several noblemen, business leaders, and family members as governor-generals to rule the newly-conquered planets on her behalf. Over roughly a decade, Rinelia oversaw numerous programs of oppression designed to eliminate alien civilizations and their culture as well as the development of human settlements on the colonized worlds. She also had ships colonize other star systems such as Epsilon Indi, Alpha Centauri, etc., though no programs of oppression were created for these systems due to their lack of native civilizations. On June 4, 2086, Rinelia su Kalgamania announced the formation of the **Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP)**, an organization designed to \\"bring order and civility\\" to non-human species. Under Rinelia's orders, the GIP rounded up hundreds of thousands of aliens and imprisoned, tortured, or even murdered them. Oftentimes, they would murder or capture aliens in broad daylight in public; Rinelia and the GIP would cover-up these incidents by concocting false stories of the aliens in question threatening to incide violence against humans. This not only deflected criticisms of Rinelia's programs of oppression, but also contributed to the Empress' speciesist propaganda campaign. Back on Earth, Rinelia built a lavish lifestyle for herself, hiring thousands of servants including many alien slaves. She had a new, much larger imperial palace, the Tower of Babel, built for her. Like the previous emperors, Empress Rinelia treated her servants with extreme, wanton cruelty; she would have butlers and maids tortured or executed for minor offenses such as breaking furniture, getting recipes wrong, creating stains on her dress, etc. She also imposed outrageous tasks and restrictions on the royal staff; Rinelia would force her cooks to create huge meals, her gardeners to tend to large swaths of her personal garden (the Court of Thorns and Roses, nicknamed the Court of Death and Destruction by servants due to the high number of executions carried out there), and other servants to complete long, arduous chores over an unrealistically short period of time, executing anyone who failed to meet these impossible goals. The Empress limited the servants' pay as well, with most receiving as little as 1 cent an hour. Rinelia frequently practiced favoritism in paying her servants, with the Empress granting more money to servants she favored and cutting the pay of servants she disliked or held no particular care for. Alien slaves enlisted as servants in Rinelia's palace received no pay.","output":"Your provided text contains detailed information about a fictional entity called the \\"Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania,\\" including its establishment, governance, cultural practices, and eventual demise.

When I press one button I want it to go to another edit from connected to another list how would I do that","output":"In Power Apps, managing multiple forms and switching between them based on button clicks can be achieved with a combination of visibility properties and context variables. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this: # Step 1: Setting Up Your Edit Forms First, ensure you have all your edit forms placed on your canvas. Each form should be connected to its respective data source (i.e., the different lists you mentioned). 1. **Add your forms**: Go to Insert > Forms > Edit, and set up each form with its respective data source. 2. **Position your forms**: You can place the forms on top of each other or organize them as you see fit. Just ensure they're all on the canvas. # Step 2: Create Context Variables Through Buttons You will use context variables to control which form is visible at any given time. For each button: 1. **Select Button**: Click on one of the buttons. 2. **Set OnSelect Property**: Go to the formula bar, and use the \`UpdateContext\` function to set a variable. For example, for Button1 that should show Form1, you might write: \`\`\` UpdateContext({visibleForm:\\"Form1\\"}) \`\`\` Repeat this for each button, changing the value of \`visibleForm\` to correspond to the form it should show (e.g., \\"Form2\\" for Button2, etc.). # Step 3: Set Visibility of Each Form 1. **Select Form**: Click on your first edit form. 2. **Set Visible Property**: In the formula bar, write a condition that checks the value of \`visibleForm\`. For Form1, the formula will look like this: \`\`\` visibleForm = \\"Form1\\" \`\`\` This formula will evaluate to true when \`visibleForm\` equals \\"Form1\\", making the form visible only in that case. Repeat this step for each form, modifying the condition to match the respective form (\\"Form2\\", \\"Form3\\", etc.). # Step 4: Testing Now, when you click each button, the \`UpdateContext\` function changes the value of the \`visibleForm\` variable, which in turn, controls the visibility of the forms. Pressing a specific button will make its corresponding form visible while hiding the others. # Additional Consideration: Default Visibility Before testing, you might want to set a default form to be visible when the app starts. This can be done either by: - Setting an \`OnVisible\` property of the screen to initialize \`visibleForm\`. - Directly setting a default variable in the App's \`OnStart\` property like: \`\`\` Set(visibleForm, \\"Form1\\") \`\`\` Replace \`\\"Form1\\"\` with whichever form you want to be visible by default. # Using Collections for Complex Conditions If your app scales or the logic becomes more complex (e.g., specific forms visible under multiple conditions), consider using collections to manage visibility states more dynamically. This method provides a simple way to manage multiple forms and their visibility in Power Apps, offering a clean and user-friendly interface for app users to navigate through different forms and the data they contain."},{"instruction":"Hi GPT.

Janet's school has just started a girls' rugby team. Janet is really keen to join and is trying to persuade her mom to let her. Her mom makes various objections and Janet politely but firmly argues against them. Among other things, her mom says it sounds really rough. Janet loves the idea of playing rough for once. Her mom says she'd have to play even when it was wet and muddy. Janet thinks it sounds great fun being allowed - and actually expected - to roll and dive around in the mud. Come up with some other things as well. Use your own words and don't parrot the phrasing of this request. Janet is a relatively young girl and doesn't view the world as an academic would. She doesn't care about challenging stereotypes, breaking barrier or societal norms, so don't even mention these in the story. She just thinks it sounds like so much fun playing a rough, dirty sport.","output":"Janet bounced into the kitchen, where her mom was preparing dinner, with an excitement that couldn't be contained. Her eyes were sparkling with a mixture of determination and exhilaration. \\"Mom, guess what? Our school is starting a girls' rugby team! Can I join, please?\\" Janet clasped her hands together, her smile as wide as the rugby field she hoped to play on. Her mom paused, a carrot half-chopped on the cutting board. \\"Rugby, Janet? That sounds awfully rough,\\" she said, her eyebrows knitting together in concern. \\"But mom, that's the best part!\\" Janet's voice was full of enthusiasm. \\"Running around, dodging, and tackling—it sounds like a grand adventure!\\" Her mom resumed chopping, albeit slowly, clearly mulling over her next words. \\"And what about the weather? You know it won't always be sunny. You'd have to play in the rain, get all wet and muddy.\\" Janet's eyes lit up even more, if that was possible. \\"Oh, that sounds like so much fun! Imagine being allowed to get muddy on purpose. It would be like those mud pies we made in the backyard when I was little, but even better because I’d be diving and scoring tries!\\" Her mom chuckled, shaking her head in mild disbelief at Janet's enthusiasm for mud and mayhem. \\"And the laundry, Janet. My poor washing machine will be working overtime with all those grass and mud stains.\\" Janet bounced on her toes, her mind racing with solutions. \\"I could learn how to do the laundry! Plus, grass stains are a badge of honor. It'll show how hard I’ve been playing and training!\\" Seeing her mom's hesitation was starting to wane, Janet decided to add one more point to seal the deal. \\"And think about the teamwork! I'll make so many new friends, and we'll learn how to support each other, on and off the field. It's not just about the rugby; it's about being part of something bigger.\\" Her mom put down the knife, turned to face Janet fully, and took a deep breath. The kitchen was filled with the aroma of dinner cooking, mixed with the undeniable sense of Janet's unwavering determination. \\"Alright, Janet,\\" her mom said, a smile finally breaking through her earlier reservations. \\"You can join the rugby team. But you're going to have to commit, even on the cold, rainy days when the mud seems less fun and more like a cold, wet blanket.\\" Janet leaped into her mom's arms, her heart soaring. \\"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I promise, mom. Even when it's raining sideways, I'll remember how much I wanted this.\\" And so, Janet joined the girls’ rugby team, embracing every tackle, every muddy dive, and every rain-soaked practice with a joy and fervor that only someone who truly loves the game could. Her mom watched from the sidelines, a mix of pride and slight apprehension in her eyes, but above all, a deep love for the muddy, beaming, rugby-playing girl who had followed her heart into the scrum."},{"instruction":"When did Nickelodeon remove the splat","output":"Nickelodeon's iconic \\"splat\\" logo, which had been associated with the network for many years, was officially replaced on September 28, 2009. The splat logo, which took various shapes and forms but consistently featured a splash or \\"splat\\" of orange, was replaced by a more streamlined and uniform logo. This new logo maintained the orange color scheme but opted for a clean, rounded typeface spelling out \\"Nickelodeon.\\" The change was part of a rebranding effort to unify the branding across Nickelodeon's various platforms and services."},{"instruction":"The splat is back now, beginning with the 2023 KCAs, Also now ALL the Nick channels are using it","output":"As of my last update in September 2023, I can't confirm real-time updates or changes to Nickelodeon's branding decisions beyond that point. If Nickelodeon has indeed brought back the \\"splat\\" logo starting with the 2023 Kids' Choice Awards (KCAs) and extended its use across all Nick channels, this would mark a significant return to its classic branding, which holds nostalgic value for many viewers. Such a decision could be seen as an effort to reconnect with fans of the era when the splat was prominently featured, as well as to unify the channel's branding with a universally recognized symbol. However, for the most current information on Nickelodeon's branding and logo usage, checking the latest press releases or official Nickelodeon corporate communications would be the best approach."},{"instruction":"It happened in March","output":"As of my last update, I don't have real-time access to events or changes after September 2023. If Nickelodeon reintroduced the \\"splat\\" logo starting with the 2023 Kids' Choice Awards in March, and expanded its use across all Nickelodeon channels, this represents a notable shift towards embracing nostalgic elements from the network's history. The \\"splat\\" logo is deeply rooted in the identity of Nickelodeon from the 1990s and early 2000s, symbolizing a fun, irreverent, and creative ethos that defined the network for many viewers during that era. The decision to return to the \\"splat\\" could be part of a larger strategy to appeal to both new audiences and viewers who grew up with Nickelodeon during its original \\"splat\\" period. It may serve to unify the brand across its various channels and services, capitalizing on the widespread recognition and affection for the classic logo.

Here are some steps you might consider taking, based on Christian values: # 1. Reflect on What Makes the Relationship \\"Bad\\" Identify specific behaviors or patterns that are concerning. Is it a matter of differing values, or are there behaviors that are clearly harmful, such as manipulation, disrespect, or abuse? Understanding the problem is the first step in addressing it. # 2. Seek Wisdom Through Prayer and Scripture - **Prayer:** Seek guidance and strength from God. Pray not only for yourself but also for the person involved, asking God to work in both of your hearts. - **Scripture:** Many passages offer insight into handling difficult relationships. For example, Proverbs 27:17 speaks about iron sharpening iron, suggesting the importance of constructive relationships. Meanwhile, 1 Corinthians 15:33 warns against bad company corrupting good character. # 3. Communicate Your Concerns - Approach the friend or boyfriend with your concerns, doing so in a manner that is kind and respectful yet clear and direct. Matthew 18:15-17 provides a template for addressing someone who has sinned against you, emphasizing the importance of direct communication. - Be specific about what behaviors are problematic and how they make you feel, focusing on \\"I\\" statements to avoid sounding accusatory. # 4. Set Boundaries - Establish clear boundaries to protect your emotional and spiritual well-being. Jesus Himself set boundaries in His relationships, knowing when to withdraw from crowds or individuals who drained Him (Mark 1:35). - Communicate these boundaries explicitly to the person. Explain the consequences of crossing these boundaries, such as spending less time with them or ending the relationship. # 5. Offer Forgiveness, but Seek Change - Forgiveness is a core Christian value, reflecting God's forgiveness towards us (Ephesians 4:32). However, forgiveness does not mean tolerating continual harm or not holding the person accountable. - Encourage the person to seek change, whether it's through counseling, spiritual guidance, or personal reflection. Offer support in their journey towards improvement. # 6. Seek Support and Counsel - Don't navigate this alone. Seek support from trusted friends, family, or leaders within your church community. - Professional counseling from a Christian perspective can also offer valuable insights and guidance. # 7. Be Prepared to Take Tough Decisions - In some cases, maintaining the relationship may not be healthy or feasible. If the relationship is characterized by abuse or profound disrespect, it might be necessary to end it, even though this is a difficult decision. - Remember, ending a harmful relationship is not a failure on your part to be a good Christian. It reflects a commitment to God's plan for everyone to live in love, respect, and peace. Navigating a bad relationship as a Christian is about seeking a balance between grace and wisdom, forgiveness and self-protection, always guided by prayer, scripture, and the counsel of the Christian community."},{"instruction":"|-Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania MOTTO: \\"All Hail the Earth!\\" CAPITAL: Leviticus City (formerly San Francisco) LARGEST CITY: Exodus (formerly London) AREA: 13 star systems POPULATION: 190 billion RELIGION; Christianity OFFICIAL LANGUAGES: English DEMONYM: Kalgamanian GOVERNMENT: Imperialist Absolute Monarchy LEGISLATURE: Kalgamanian Royal Family FOUNDED: December 26, 2030 GDP: 495 trillion CURRENCY: Pounds The **Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania**, also known as the **Holy Empire of Kalgamania** or just **Kalgamania**, was a global and interstellar superpower that ruled the entire Earth along with countless planets in twelve other star systems from 2030 to 2102. It was a far-right imperialist power infamous for its rampant state- and corporate-sponsored bigotry and its ruthless principles of Social Darwinism. Its ruling powers believed that humans were a superior race and that all other sentient civilizations were \\"backwards\\" and \\"primitive\\". It conquered numerous exoplanets and subjected any native inhabitants to apartheid and discrimination. Eventually, rebels from one of its colony worlds, Uingffh, overthrew the empire in 2102. In addition to its speciesism, Kalgamania was also known to discriminate against minorities within the human race as well. The upper classes were predominantly white or white-passing cisgender, neurotypical men. Church and state were not separate and prosecution of other religious faiths as well as members of the LGBTQ+ community was common, with bible verses such as Leviticus 18:22 being used to justify these acts. Neurodivergent people such as autistics and those with ADHD were also looked down upon, with many of Kalgamania's social norms directly going against common neurodivergent traits. Kalgamania's capital was Leviticus City, which despite the country's European roots is located in what was once the Bay Area region of what used to be the U.S. state of California. It was notable for containing an immense three kilometer-long ring-shaped palace which served as the home of the empire's royal family. ~~History ~Pre-interstellar era and Kalgamanian Revolution (2030-2040) Before Kalgamania had been established, humanity was in disarray due to numerous natural calamities like climate change and a group of extremely powerful hurricanes in 2027 including one that severely affected the global climate and destroyed large portions of the North American Continent. With many nations collapsing or on the verge of doing so, conditions were ripe for an extremist government to take power, as many citizens started blaming moderate ideologies like liberalism and conservatism for the state of the Earth and began looking towards more radical ideologies. This was enhanced by the fact that Generation Z, which was known for being predominantly far-left, was now old enough to begin taking positions of power. Eventually, a group of seven English politicians began promoting an ideology they called Kalgamania in 2028. In stark contrast to the overall leftist political atmosphere of the Earth at the time, Kalgamania was very far right and blamed minority groups such as people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women who did not abide by traditonal gender norms, etc. for the chaos. Through use of unusually powerful arms as well as a massive propaganda campaign, Kalgamania was able to become the dominant party on Earth and was eventually founded as a nation on December 26, 2030. However, this was not without the deaths of nearly a billion people in the process. The politicians who had formed the nation seated themselves as Kalgamania's royal family and turned the nation into an absolute monarchy. The process of Kalgamania rising to power would become known as the Kalgamanian Revolution. The unusual power of Kalgamania's technology has driven conspiracy theories that the founders were being assisted by aliens or were performing supernatural rituals, but the government has repeatedly driven down these statements with the simple notion that their technological advancements were because of \\"the everlasting greatness of the human race.\\" The flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carried some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. ~Peaceful interstellar era (2040-2084) After the empire was founded, the royal family pushed for rapid technological development in order to recover from the ruin caused by the natural disasters. To this end, the Kalgamanian royal family decided to decrease their influence slightly and breed free-market capitalism with the promise that successful businessmen would become nobles of the empire and be granted special privileges. This effort turned out to be successful, with humanity becoming capable of commercial interplanetary travel by 2035 and with many colonies being set up on Mars, the Moon, and moons of the outer giant planets. However, classism became rampant as a side effect of this, adding on to the already severe bigotry towards other minorities. To quell rebellions, Kalgamania developed its already powerful military and used it against dissent. By 2040, Kalgamania had discovered a wormhole in the outer fringes of the solar system that led to the star system of Gliese 105. Humanity sent a ship named the Voyager III into the wormhole and discovered numerous alien races in the system (which they called Ingffhaestia), including those of Uingffh. Despite Kalgamania's xenophobic tendencies, they were friendly towards the aliens and even established a colony on Uingffh called Neo Gaia in 2050. Ingffhaestia and Kalgamania lived in relative peace as the two shared information about their biology and cultures. However, tensions arose in 2075 when the two began learning more about their respective political ideologies. Ingffhaestia did not condone Kalgamania's acts of discrimination and its capitalist system while Kalgamania became opposed to Ingffhaestia due to Ingffhaestia being socialist, which went directly against Kalgamania's principles. This would soon escalate into outright war in 2084. ~Colonial interstellar era (2085-2098) [An illustration of Rinelia su Kalgamania, the empress of Kalgamania at the time Kalgamania invaded Ingffhaestia. Its illustrator was later executed upon coming out as bisexual.] In 2085, Kalgamania, with its highly advanced technology born out of worker abuse and slave labor, easily won the war against Ingffhaestia in 2085, subsequently placing every planet in Ingffhaestia under its control. Kalgamania transitioned into a colonial power similar to European nations during the 1800's and 1900's and began extending its discriminatory policies towards Ingffhaestian species with the justification that humans were genetically superior and Ingffhaestian aliens inferior. Ingffhaestians were barred from participating in Kalgamanian society and were either sent to concentration camps for experimentation, were forced to work in unhealthy conditions 24/7 for one of the empire's many private businesses, or were simply executed. Entire families were separated and children as young as newborns were murdered. Propaganda was set up that portrayed member species of the now-fallen Ingffhaestian Federation as evil and blasphemous while history classes were forced to give biased information pertaining to why non-humans were not to be trusted. Invasive earth species were introduced to many worlds that led to the extinction of millions of native alien life. Nationalism also became rampant, with Kalgamanian flags being held up in almost every public place and schools being forced to give patriotic education. After Ingffhaestia was conquered, Kalgamania began invading numerous other star systems after inventing wormhole-generating devices. A total of eleven other solar systems became colonized by the empire, which were each represented by an added star to the Kalgamanian flag. Any native species inhabiting these systems were subjected to the same discriminatory practices used on the Ingffhaestians. Humanity even invented weapons called world glassers which had the ability to burn the surface of whole continents and were used to put down any opposition against the royal family or the noble corporations. ~~Government Earth-Kalgamania is an absolute monarchy composed of a royal family which wields almost absolute power over their empire. Royals have the ability to execute people, pass laws, etc. at ease with very little restrictions. Ordinary citizens have little say in their government's affairs. The head of the family is a single emperor or empress whose power trumps even other royal family members. Emperors stay in power until they die or they voluntarily resign, though resignation is highly looked down upon and is seen as a sign of weakness. The royal family is divided up into seven houses representing each of the seven founders of Kalgamania. In order from most powerful to least powerful, they are the Houses of Su, Inv, Ir, Ace, Av, Gul, and Lux. Royal family members have his/her (the use of him or her rather than them is intentional, as non-binary people were forbidden to have positions of power in the empire and any royal family member found out to be non-binary was executed) house name as their middle name and \\"Kalgamania\\" as his/her last name. For example, Rinelia su Kalgamania is a member of the House of Su and thus carries the middle name of su. All middle names are in lowercase. In addition to the royal family, wealthy businessmen also have considerable political power. Many of them are nobles appointed by the emperor, and advertisements for their respective companies are just as common and widespread as government propaganda. However, the royal family still carries more political power than businessmen and has the ability to restrict their influence at will, especially if their ideas go against that of Kalgamania. Every colony planet/moon has one governor-general assigned to it who rules over the world on behalf of the emperor's. Governor-generals can only be appointed by the emperor him/herself and are usually members of the royal family, though some governor-generals are prominent businessmen with no genetic ties to the royal bloodline. ~Order of succession When an emperor dies or resigns, the person who will be the next emperor is determined by age and house. The next person in line to become emperor of Kalgamania is usually the oldest person in the House of Su. If all members of the House of Su are deceased or exiled, then the oldest member of the House of Inv will become emperor in accordance to the order of most powerful royal houses, followed by the next oldest in Inv. If all members of the House of Inv are also dead, then the oldest in the House of Ir will become emperor and so on. In the rare case that every member of the royal family is killed, a nobleman will be selected at random to become emperor. At least one member of the House of Su was alive throughout the entirety of Kalgamania's history, so none of these measures have ever been taken. Anyone who is crowned emperor automatically gains \\"su\\" as a middle name and becomes new head of the House of Su regardless of whether or not he/she was part of the House of Su beforehand. ~List of Rulers Over Kalgamania's 72-year history, the empire saw a total of three emperors. All three were part of the same bloodline and are listed below. List of Kalgamanian emperors Name|Period of Rule|Notes Nathan su Kalgamania|December 26, 2030 - November 11, 2052|Founder of Kalgamania Odysseus su Kalgamania|November 14, 2052 - October 8, 2084|Died from assassination; likely culprit is Rinelia Rinelia su Kalgamania|October 20, 2084 - September 20, 2102|First female ruler; took power after the death of her father Odysseus (which was likely her doing) ~~Economy Despite the controlling and totalitarianist nature of Kalgamania, the empire's economy is primarily capitalist. Private individuals control most means of production and are allowed to build companies with very little restrictions, with the only justification for restricting a company's rights being if they express direct opposition towards the royal family. Workers' rights are disregarded and entrepreneurs are allowed to pay their employees as little as they like, set as many work hours as they like, and even execute workers. Businessmen carry a large amount of influence on Kalgamanian politics and culture and carry similar privileges to royal family members. Advertisements for their companies are widespread and are just as, if not more common than government propaganda. Particularly successful entrepreneurs are often granted noble status by the emperor. As a result of this capitalist economy, Kalgamania is highly advanced technologically, but everyday citizens live largely in poverty. Communism and its flaws are often used as fear tactics by both the royal family and companies to keep the general population loyal to Kalgamania despite their poor living conditions. Helping the poor is looked at with disdain and poverty is seen as simply the result of failure on the poor's part - an extension of the overall Social Darwinist nature of the empire. ~~Culture Kalgamanian culture has a large emphasis on tradition. Many aspects of European culture, such as the use of English as the dominant language, pounds being used as currency, etc. are found in Kalgamania. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire, but only in their traditional European forms (e.g. baroque and classical music, realistic art, and classical literature). Cultural works from the modern era (cartoon/anime art, modern literature, rap/pop music, etc.) and from other cultures are looked down upon, though there are some cases of them being successful. Despite this, Kalgamania has highly advanced technology which is celebrated by both the general populace and the nobility/royalty. Social norms, keeping order, survival of the fittest (Social Darwinism), and an aversion to things perceived as abnormal play a large role in Kalgamanian society and are largely tied in with its traditional values. This unfortunately also means that discrimination against minorities is widespread, with bigotry having a powerful influence on Kalgamanian society. Derogatory slurs such as nigger, faggot, dyke, retard, etc. are are often thrown around by both the youth and even mature adults. ~Sexism Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Kalgamania. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Kalgamanian law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Kalgamanian society and was banned in the empire. Despite these social norms, several women existed who carry high positions in Kalgamanian society, though they were mostly royalty and still discriminated against other minority groups. The last emperor/empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania was female: Rinelia su Kalgamania. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. ~Ableism Extroversion, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, introversion, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as \\"unusual\\" hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Kalgamania contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. \`Homophobia Homophobia was commonplace in Kalgamania due to the empire's Christian roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Kalgamania's version of Christianity. Same-gender relationships were illegal and gay people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. Businessmen were allowed to fire workers on the basis of their sexuality. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Kalgamanian law. Gay couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. The words gay and homosexual were often used as insults. ~Biphobia Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Kalgamanian society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like gay people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. ~Aphobia Asexual and aromantic people were targeted by the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania in addition to bisexuals and homosexuals. Because it was considered Kalgamanians' duty to have a partner and raise a family, those who did not experience sexual or romantic attraction were looked down upon and treated in similar ways to bisexuals and homosexuals. Many asexuals and aromantics were forced to have sex or enter unwanted romantic relationships, which was worsened by the fact that sexual assault was fully condoned by the empire. ~Transphobia Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community: with oppression. Kalgamania saw gender and sex as one and the same; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Kalgamanian youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. ~Racism Continuing with the Social Darwinist trend of the empire, white Kalgamanians saw themselves as superior to people of color. Lynching and beating of people of color were commonplace and Black, Asian, etc. culture was suppressed. Having hairstyles indicative of people of color, like afros and dreadlocks, was punishable by indefinite imprisonment until the offender chooses to cut his/her hair to something more acceptable by Kalgamanian standards. Racial stereotypes were frequently seen in Kalgamanian media such as exaggeratedly narrow eyes in Asian characters and the notion of Black people liking watermelons. Non-European cultures were highly stereotyped and misrepresented. ~Religious discrimination People who preached faiths other than Christianity were fiercely condemned by Earth-Kalgamania. Jews, muslims, etc. were often incarcerated by the state or businesses and were tortured in order to get them to convert to Christianity. Corporations did not give accommodations to people who needed to observe religious holidays and traditions for important times of the year like Hanukkah and Ramadan were disrespected and ignored. Even atheists were subject to prejudice by the holy empire and were pressured by peers, the government, etc. to become Christian. -Antisemitism Kalgamanians were allowed to freely display Nazi symbols and other anti-Jewish symbols. Jewish stereotypes were rampant in the media and antisemitic ideas were woven into education. The construction of synagogues was forbidden by Kalgamanian law and any synagogue built was to be demolished and its builders executed. -Islamophobia People were forbidden to wear hijabs both in public and in private. Schools and media taught children that muslims were anti-Kalgamania terrorists and not to be trusted. Like with Jews and other religious minorities, muslims were frequently blamed for any misfortune that occurs in the Holy Kalgamanian Empire. ~Ageism Though not directly present in Kalgamanian laws, discrimination against both the elderly and the young was common. Elderly people whose old age inhibited their supposed usefulness in Kalgamanian society were murdered by hospitals similarly to disabled people. Young people were painted as selfish, naive, and unfit to have a say in important issues even if they show consistently mature behavior. ~Classism Due to the Earth-Kalgamanian Empire being a highly capitalist and consumerist country, classism was common. Poverty was widespread in Kalgamanian colonies and the lower social classes lived in conditions comparable to those other minorities lived in. Kalgamanians are taught that poverty is the fault of the poor themselves despite the fact that businessmen hoarding money and abusing workers was the main cause of poverty. ~Speciesism Speciesism was one of the most prominent forms of bigotry influencing Kalgamanian culture. New slurs made out of the names of alien species were frequent. For example, members of the tabulon race, the native species of Uingffh and Urlum/the Seraph's species, were referred to by the derogatory word tabbie. Species also experienced derogatory comparisons to fictional alien species in Earth pop culture such as the Wookies from Star Wars, the Vulcans from Star Trek, and the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar. Much like with the poor, people are taught that the cruel treatment of aliens is justified by the notion that the humans won fairly and that they are free to do what they want with those they defeated. Schools were also forced to teach that aliens were inherently evil and dangerous. Most media featuring aliens portrayed the aliens in a negative and heavily stereotyped manner. Many propaganda posters depict aliens doing traditionally immoral deeds, sometimes with a conventionally attractive human doing good deeds for comparison. ~Nationalism Nationalism and patriotism have a large influence over culture in the empire. Kalgamanian children are taught to display their utmost loyalty to their nation. Even their birth certificates contain a Kalgamanian flag and the motto of \\"All hail the Earth!\\" on their corners. Kalgamanian flags can often be seen on city streets and it is national law to display a Kalgamanian flag in front of every household. Propaganda against aliens is commonplace. All classes are forced to recite the following pledge while facing the flag before resuming normal learning activities: *\\"I pledge my loyalty, my strength, and my wisdom to the Emperor, to Earth, to humanity, and to God. And to our almighty fatherland - the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania, a perfect nation, blessed by the Lord, undefeatable, which shall spread order and stability across the universe. All hail Kalgamania! All hail the Earth! All hail humanity!”* All classes are from a patriotic viewpoint and contain anti-alien propaganda weaved into their lessons. The Kalgamanian military is glorified and many films about its victories exist. Furthermore, television channels frequently broadcast advertisements encouraging or even guilt-tripping citizens into joining the armed forces. ~Individualism and Social Darwinism [An old political comic originally created before Kalgamania rose which is now used frequently by the empire. Original source unknown.] Despite the controlling nature of Earth-Kalgamania's ruling powers, individualism is a strongly valued concept in the country. However, it has been twisted in a way that breeds entitlement and toxicity as opposed to genuine freedom. Individualism only exists for privileged groups (white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, male, human, etc.) and freedom is used as a justification for bigoted beliefs. The belief of Social Darwinism is perpetuated in the empire and life is seen as survival of the fittest. Victim blaming is very common and people who do immoral acts towards others are given leeway in the Kalgamanian judicial system unless their acts go against Kalgamanian philosophy. People undergoing struggle are told to simply get over their issues regardless of whether doing so is actually feasible or not. Asking for help from others is looked down upon as a sign of weakness. This sense of individualism often influences Kalgamanian bigotry such as transgender people being told to just accept the bodies they were born in, the poor being blamed for their own poverty, toxic masculinity, rape culture, etc. ~National Flower [Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii is the national flower of the Kalgamanian Empire.] The national flower of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania is Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii, a breed of Agapanthus praecox. The plant is known for its long stalks containing large umbels of small bell-shaped flowers whose purple color is likened to that of the Kalgamanian flag, which is why it was named the national flower of the Empire. Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii can be found in numerous places such as in front of businesses, in parking lots, and more in Leviticus City and other Mediterranean climates due to the plant being fit for warm areas. They are also known to be popular garden plants, as they do not require much maintenance. However, they are considered a nuisance to citizens of the Empire (particularly amongst the lower social classes) due to the agapanthuses invading local ecosystems as well as because their strong roots often damage concrete. They are infamous among aliens as being representative of the destruction of their homeworlds' ecosystems due the fact that thousands of square kilometers of alien wildlife were harmed by invasive Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii specimens. By 2103, Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii was banned from existing on alien planets and all plants of the breed were seen as weeds and pulled, though they continue to exist in large numbers on Earth. ~~Religion Kalgamania's dominant religion is Christianity, which is reflected in the references to God in the Kalgamanian pledge. Christianity is weaved into many of the policies and laws of the empire and separation of church and state is nonexistent, which is seen in how Earth-Kalgamania is referred to as a 'holy' empire. The Bible is often used as a justification for Kalgamania's strict policies of discrimination; for example, its law of forbidding same-sex relationships uses Leviticus 18:22 (\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\\") as its justification. People of other faiths or who are atheist are encouraged to convert to Christianity. The pope and other high-ranking members of the Christian Church carry power comparable to that of businessmen and royalty. Kalgamanians celebrate Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though like in the real world, they have largely been turned into tools used by entrepreneurs to increase sales. ~\`Military Kalgamania's military is known as the Holy Kalgamanian Armed Forces (HKAF). They are among one of the most powerful militaries and carry numerous pieces of advanced technology. Their soldier numbers amount in the billions and they own millions of tanks, guns, planes, and spaceships. Laser technology is heavily utilized by Kalgamania in its military endeavors. ~World glassers One of the most infamous and feared weapons of the HKAF is the world glasser, a kilometer-long spaceship with the ability to soil entire landmasses by concentrating nuclear charges in a fashion similar to the Casaba-Howitzer Project. Though the Juprits-class world glasser is the main type of world glasser, other world glasser variants exist, albeit they are used sparingly and rarely. A total of ten world glasser types, including the Juprits, were built by Kalgamania. [The Juprits-Class World Glasser. 1.9 kilometers long, it was the standard model of world glasser used by Kalgamania. It had two cannons which could fire lasers with the ability to destroy a city.] [The Juperius-Class World Glasser was a slight improvement on the Juprits' design, being 2.5 kilometers long and bearing four cannons instead of two.] [The Courageous-Class Heavy World Glasser was another heavy world glasser. Being 6 km long, it carried only two world-glassing cannons, but they were both more powerful than that of the Trident and could create explosions the size of Texas.] [The Trident-Class Heavy World Glasser was the first in a line of three larger world glasser classes called heavy world glassers. 4 km long, the Trident was actually two ships attached to each other. The Trident carried four cannons, two for each ship, which can each destroy an area the size of a small country or U.S. state.] [The Privilege-Class was the first of a line of even larger world glassers called Super World Glassers. It was 8 km long and carried eight cannons whose lasers can destroy large countries or even landmasses.] [The Catalyst-Class, a variation of the Courageous. The Catalyst lacks the large spar and underside structures on the bottom of a normal Courageous, making it much more agile in combat.] [The Oppressor-Class Super World Glasser was an even larger super world glasser that was 10 km long. It carried 12 cannons compared to the Privilege's measly eight. Its two towers on the top could fire potent lasers of their own which could eliminate enemy ships with ease in addition to the ship's numerous other guns.] [The Absolute-Class Super World Glasser was the largest of the super world glassers, being 12.5 km in length. This ship class carried two towers on top which had the ability to let out pulses. These pulses could temporarily disable enemy ships, ensuring an easy victory.] [The Empyrean-Class was the largest and most powerful world glasser in the whole HKAF, being described as a hyper world glasser. The Empyrean was 15 km long and has the ability to decimate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it uninhabitable for centuries. Only one Empyrean was built, and it was used as the flagship of Rinelia.] [The Heartless-Class Super World Glasser was a reactionary redesign of the super world glasser when it was found that the city-like structures at the top of super world glassers could be used by fighter planes as cover. The Heartless solves this issue by having its cityscape covered, depriving fighters of the ability to hide in them. The Heartless was 10 km long and contained a single but powerful cannon.] ~Gliese Indigenous Police One of the most well-known parts of the military was the Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP), a police force stationed in Gliese 105. Though its purpose was as a general police force for helping the populace, its main task was oppressing native alien races and keeping their power in check. Video footage of the GIP brutally beating or even murdering natives exists online. One particular beating, the murder of tabulon Catalystia Floraze through chokehold, gained widespread media attention and began a social movement known as Tabulon Lives Matter (TLM), which was later expanded to Protect Indigenous Aliens (PIA) as more and more Kalgamanian citizens realized the flaws of their government. Both of these movements paved the way for the Seraphim Rebellion. ~~Demographics Though the term \\"Kalgamanian\\" technically refers to any human loyal to Kalgamania, it is usually only used to the 99.2% of the human population that is of European descent. Only 0.8% of all Kalgamanian citizens are people of color due to ethnic cleansing and racism. ~~Geographics Though beginning in Europe, Kalgamnia's territory quickly expanded to include all of Earth's land area after conquering all other countries in existence. At its peak, the empire also controlled the entire Solar System along with twelve other star systems all within 50 light-years of Earth. All of these territories except Earth were later lost when the Seraph rebelled and dismantled Earth-Kalgamania in 2102. ~List of colonies * = habitable world >Solar System >>Mercury >>Venus >>Earth* (Capital of the Empire) >>Mars >>Jupiter >>Saturn >>Uranus >>Neptune >Alpha Centauri A System >>Alva >>Blalo* >>Orus >Alpha Centauri B System >>Kaith >>Cale >>Syro >Proxima Centauri >>Iro >>Narath* >>Sian >>Ernus >Cervantes (Mu Arae) System >>Dulcinea >>Rocinante >>>Paleo* >>Quijote >>>Neo* >>Sancho >Ran (Epsilon Eridani) System >>Odin >>Thoriam >>>Epaphus* >>Aegir >>Tias >Apollo (HD 219134) System >>Hephaestus >>Aphrodite >>Nereus >>Aura >>Penthesileia >>Ares* >>Cardea >>>Dionysus* >>Aeolus >>>Achlys* >Tabaldak (Epsilon Indi) System >>Dzeedzeebonda* >>Gluskab* >>Bmda >>Chibaiskweda >>Azeban/Tsinoo (Binary Planet) >Chawalan (47 Ursae Majoris) System >>Phi Phong >>Pret >>Nang Tan* >>Taphao Thong >>>Kuman Thong* >>Taphao Khew >>Phosop >TRAPPIST-1 System >>Holland >>Helsbergen >>Hennendal >>Alicanto >>Payachata* >>Llorona* >>Tirana >Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) System >>Firades >>Lavaria >>Shoji >>Coppelius >>>Uingffh* >>Saringffh* >>Ibiridius* >>>Muulforia* >>>Yangteon* >>>Cornelia* >>>Gabolar* >>Azure >>Fillonia >>Halmonia >>Golmia >>Hege >>Xong >>Ajooni >>Digrazia >Avimotalis System >>Onaut >>Narva >>Exicle >>Bor* >>Kitanis >>>Lelantos* >>>Durus* >>>Nides >>Pronos >>Sriaturn >Heranis System >>Lurmes >>Ilsadite >>Sahariana* >>Rasaidor* >>Florazia* >>Olympia* >>Pluma >>Augustus >>Ardollo >>Jasper >>Transolia ~~Flag As mentioned previously, the flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carries some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. The twelve stars on the diagonal stripes represent each of the twelve star systems conquered by the empire. |-Rinelia su Kalgamania Rinelia su Kalgamania 3rd Empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania In office: October 20, 2084 - December 26, 2099 Predecessor: Odysseus su Kalgamania (father) Successor: N/A (last empress; Kalgamania dissolved following end of rule) Personal Information Partner: None Children: None Father: Odysseus su Kalgamania (2nd Emperor of Kalgamania) Mother: Penelope su Kalgamania Born: December 26, 2074, Leviticus City Died: December 26, 2099 (age 25), Leviticus City Religion: Catholicism Rinelia su Kalgamania (December 26, 2074 - December 26, 2099) was the third and final empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania (LVL's Urlum the Usurper) as well as Kalgamania's first female ruler. Taking the throne at a record young age of 9 following the murder of her parents and former rulers Odysseus and Penelope (allegedly at her own hands) su Kalgamania, Rinelia ruled the Holy Kalgamanian Empire from 2084 to 2099, when she was ousted from power by Urlum Eudae Kaywell during the Seraphim Rebellion of 2099. Rinelia was responsible for the conquest of the Ingffhaestian System and the transformation of Kalgamania into an interstellar power. As empress, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and was infamous for conducting oppressive policies towards minority groups including people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, political dissidents, etc. She was also a devout Catholic and took part in the religious persecution of countless religious minorities. However, her most notable act was the invasion of the Ingffhaestian Federation a year after she began her rule; during and after the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Rinelia closely involved herself in the brutal subjugation and oppression of Ingffhaestia's various alien races, whom she and her human subjects viewed as genetically inferior to them. She reportedly died on December 26, 2099 after being executed by the Seraph, leader of the Seraphim Rebellion which rose to oppose her rule. ~~Early Life Rinelia su Kalgamania was born the daughter of Emperor Odysseus su Kalgamania and his wife Penelope on December 26, 2074 along with her twin brother Lenelius su Kalgamania. Though not much is known about Rinelia's childhood due to censorship, most sources agree that Rinelia and Lenelius had a somewhat mischievous, but overall close and loving relationship and that she lived a luxurious, extravagant lifestyle in the palace. It is also known that as a child, she consumed large amounts of fictional works containing anti-Ingffhaestia rhetoric including literature; her parents looked down upon other children Rinelia's age who used modern technology such as cell phones or television, raising her in a very traditional and authoritative manner. Initially, Rinelia's older brother Telemachus su Kalgamania was the next in-line for the throne. However, anti-Kalgamanian rebels staged a bombing which killed Telemachus in 2082, resulting in heated disputes over whether Rinelia or her brother would ascend to the throne. On October 20, 2084, all members of the House of Su except Rinelia were found dead in the Leviticus City Imperial Palace, leaving Rinelia as the sole candidate for ruler. She was crowned that day as Third Empress of Kalgamania at the age of 9 years old, the youngest on record. Though unconfirmed, many historians now agree that Rinelia had executed her family herself in order to become Empress. ~~Empress As Empress, Rinelia's rule was aided by a council of royal advisors due to her young age. However, the Empress frequently bribed or threatened her advisors in order to get her ways. Following her father as well as her grandfather Nathan su Kalgamania's footsteps, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and executed all who opposed her rule. ~Ingffhestia-Kalgamania War Vehemently opposing the Ingffhaestian Federation even during childhood, Rinelia's first move as Empress was to declare war on Ingffhaestia on October 31, 2084. The Empress ordered weapon manufacturing companies to significantly increase production of spaceships and space weapons for the war by forcing employees to work 24 hours as part of her Interstellar Militarization Act (IMA). This led to several strikes and protests among workers viewing their employers' policies as exploitative; Rinelia quickly put these revolts down by force while denouncing the worker protests as \\"degeneracy on the level of those Ingffhaestian retards.\\" A total of 17,329 workers died as a result of armed enforcement of the IMA. ~~CONTENT BELOW YET TO BE REVAMPED With military production bolstered by the exploitation of workers, Kalgamania was able to procure thousands of state-of-the-art spacecraft and weaponry, including the infamous world glasser, which Rinelia immediately sent into service in the war against Ingffhaestia. They quickly overpowered the Ingffhaestian Federation's forces. On January 16, 2085, the Ingffhaestian Federation surrendered to Kalgamanian rule after its capital, the city of Yang-Moof on Planet Uingffh, was threatened to be destroyed by a shot from a world glasser. The Empress made a public statement that day blaming the Ingffhaestians' loss on their supposed genetic inferiority, proclaiming humans as a superior race. She also blamed the Ingffhaestians' emphasis on peace, stating that \\"peace is the catalyst of weakness\\" and that \\"the greatest strength comes from the greatest wars.\\" ~Colonization of Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) Following the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Empress Rinelia appointed several noblemen, business leaders, and family members as governor-generals to rule the newly-conquered planets on her behalf. Over roughly a decade, Rinelia oversaw numerous programs of oppression designed to eliminate alien civilizations and their culture as well as the development of human settlements on the colonized worlds. She also had ships colonize other star systems such as Epsilon Indi, Alpha Centauri, etc., though no programs of oppression were created for these systems due to their lack of native civilizations. On June 4, 2086, Rinelia su Kalgamania announced the formation of the **Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP)**, an organization designed to \\"bring order and civility\\" to non-human species. Under Rinelia's orders, the GIP rounded up hundreds of thousands of aliens and imprisoned, tortured, or even murdered them. Oftentimes, they would murder or capture aliens in broad daylight in public; Rinelia and the GIP would cover-up these incidents by concocting false stories of the aliens in question threatening to incide violence against humans. This not only deflected criticisms of Rinelia's programs of oppression, but also contributed to the Empress' speciesist propaganda campaign. Back on Earth, Rinelia built a lavish lifestyle for herself, hiring thousands of servants including many alien slaves. She had a new, much larger imperial palace, the Tower of Babel, built for her. Like the previous emperors, Empress Rinelia treated her servants with extreme, wanton cruelty; she would have butlers and maids tortured or executed for minor offenses such as breaking furniture, getting recipes wrong, creating stains on her dress, etc. She also imposed outrageous tasks and restrictions on the royal staff; Rinelia would force her cooks to create huge meals, her gardeners to tend to large swaths of her personal garden (the Court of Thorns and Roses, nicknamed the Court of Death and Destruction by servants due to the high number of executions carried out there), and other servants to complete long, arduous chores over an unrealistically short period of time, executing anyone who failed to meet these impossible goals. The Empress limited the servants' pay as well, with most receiving as little as 1 cent an hour. Rinelia frequently practiced favoritism in paying her servants, with the Empress granting more money to servants she favored and cutting the pay of servants she disliked or held no particular care for. Alien slaves enlisted as servants in Rinelia's palace received no pay.","output":"I'm unable to provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts longer than 90 continuous characters.

It's important to note that these assessments are speculative and crafted for a fictional character based on the information given. **MBTI:** ESTJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) - Rinelia's leadership style, decisiveness, and organizational skills suggest a strong preference for structured and controlled environments, indicative of the ESTJ personality. Her actions demonstrate a preference for outward action, practical solutions, and a logical approach to problems, often disregarding personal feelings or the emotional impact of her decisions. **Enneagram:** Type 8 (The Challenger) - Rinelia's aggressive control over her empire, willingness to dominate others, and her confrontational nature align with Type 8 characteristics. Type 8s are assertive, self-confident, and have a strong desire for control, which mirrors Rinelia's imperial rule and her methods of asserting power. **Temperament:** Choleric - In classical four temperaments theory, Rinelia is best described as choleric. She is ambitious, energetic, and passionate about expanding her empire, displaying the leadership and dominance associated with this temperament. **Big Five:** - High Extraversion: Her leadership role and assertiveness point to high extraversion. - High Neuroticism: Given her extreme measures for control and potential paranoia about threats to her power, she could be higher on neuroticism. - High Conscientiousness: She is highly organized, disciplined, and concerned with maintaining and expanding her empire. - Low Agreeableness: Rinelia's actions and strict policies indicate low empathy and concern for others' well-being. - Low Openness: Her enforcement of traditional values, resistance to change, and dismissal of other cultures suggest low openness to experience. **Socionics:** LSE (Logical Sensory Extrovert) - Similar to the ESTJ MBTI type, the LSE in Socionics values efficiency, order, and is driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, taking a practical approach to management and organization. **Instinctual Variant:** So/Sx (Social/Sexual) - Her focus on her empire's expansion, societal structure, and maintaining power suggest a dominant Social instinct, with the secondary Sexual instinct reflecting her intense personal ambition and drive. **Hogwarts House:** Slytherin - Rinelia's ambition, resourcefulness, and willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve her goals align with the characteristics of Slytherin House. **Moral Alignment:** Lawful Evil - She operates within a structured system or code (lawful), but her methods and goals are driven by self-interest and a willingness to harm others to achieve her aims (evil). These profiles are speculative interpretations based on the provided character description. Real psychology and personality assessments are complex and nuanced, often requiring in-depth analysis and feedback directly from the subject."},{"instruction":"If Kalgamania appeared on Earth, write history and timeline, year date started in now.","output":"Given the hypothetical scenario of Kalgamania's emergence in our current world, crafting a fictional history and timeline involves creative liberties while attempting to remain plausible within the provided context. The following narrative is a speculative interpretation: # 2023: The First Signs - **December**: A group of enigmatic and charismatic individuals begins to make headlines with their radical ideologies, calling for a \\"return to order\\" and the establishment of a new world empire, Kalgamania. They claim that humanity's survival hinges on unification under a single empire and a return to traditional values, mixed with a heavy emphasis on exploring space colonization as Earth's resources dwindle. # 2024: The Rise of Kalgamania - **March**: Despite skepticism from the broader public, the Kalgamania movement gains traction through powerful social media campaigns and public rallies held in major cities worldwide. Their message resonates with a significant minority, stressing unity, strength, and a promising future. - **July**: The movement forms a political party, which they call the \\"Kalgamanian Front,\\" and begins to participate in elections in several countries, with varying degrees of success. - **November**: The Kalgamanian Front wins a shocking victory in a small, politically unstable country, establishing the first Kalgamanian government. They immediately begin restructuring the country's policies towards their vision. # 2025: Expansion and Consolidation - **January - December**: The new government rapidly militarizes, asserting control over its population with an iron fist. Minorities and dissenters face persecution, and the state exerts control over the media. Kalgamania declares its intention to expand its influence. - **September**: The concept of \\"Leviticus City\\" is introduced as a project to build a new capital from which the global empire will be ruled. # 2026-2030: A Tumultuous Decade - **2026**: Kalgamania starts covert operations to destabilize neighboring countries, using both cyber warfare and political manipulation to weaken opposition and foment unrest. - **2028**: A global economic crisis gives Kalgamania the opportunity it has been looking for. With many nations weakened, they begin to exert influence more openly, offering economic support in exchange for political control. - **2030**: Kalgamania now directly controls three countries and has significant influence in several others. Leviticus City's construction begins, symbolizing the emergence of a new world power. # 2031-2040: Resistance and Conflict - **2032**: International resistance against Kalgamania grows as nations form alliances to counter its expansionist policies. Sanctions are imposed, but Kalgamania's control over critical resources makes them difficult to enforce effectively. - **2035**: Kalgamania announces they have developed technology for commercial interplanetary travel and claims to have established a colony on Mars, asserting their technological superiority. - **2038**: An international coalition launches a series of military operations aimed at curtailing Kalgamania's influence, leading to a protracted global conflict. # 2040-2050: The Fall - **2042**: Amid growing resistance both from within and outside, cracks begin to show in Kalgamania's empire. The economic strain of sustaining an interplanetary empire while under constant assault proves too much. - **2046**: A massive uprising in several Kalgamanian territories, supported by the international coalition, significantly weakens their grip on power. - **2050**: The Kalgamanian government collapses after a decisive battle in Leviticus City. The territories under its control regain independence or are restored to their pre-Kalgamania governance, and the brief era of Kalgamania comes to an end. # 2051 and Beyond: Rebuilding and Reflection - **2051-2060**: Former Kalgamanian territories focus on rebuilding and reconciliation. Global efforts aim to restore democracy and heal the divisions caused by the Kalgamanian regime. The failed empire becomes a subject of study and a cautionary tale about the dangers of extremism and the importance of unity in diversity. - **2065**: The ruins of Leviticus City are turned into a memorial and a museum dedicated to the victims of the Kalgamanian regime, serving as a testament to human resilience and the enduring spirit of freedom. This timeline imagines a rapid rise and fall of a hypothetical Kalgamanian empire on Earth, reflecting the challenges and consequences of such a dramatic and authoritarian shift in global politics."},{"instruction":"Write text: Dark Kalgamania, empire worse than Kalgamania","output":"**Dark Kalgamania: A Shadow Beyond the Empire** In the annals of speculative history, there exists an iteration of the Kalgamanian concept so malevolent that it eclipses the original empire in both its brutality and its ambition. This entity, known as Dark Kalgamania, emerges not merely as a dominating force over planets and star systems but as an existential threat to the very fabric of morality and compassion across the cosmos. Its rise, marked by events more harrowing than those that characterized its predecessor, paints a chilling portrait of unchecked power and malevolence. # The Emergence of Dark Kalgamania **2052**: The seeds of Dark Kalgamania are sown in darkness, stemming from a clandestine gathering of the original Kalgamania's most radical and disaffected extremists. Disillusioned with what they perceive as the empire's failure to achieve its most ambitious and ruthless goals, they form a shadow council dedicated to resurrecting the vision in a far more terrifying guise. **2055**: Using the collapse of Kalgamania as both a lesson and a stepping stone, Dark Kalgamania employs a blend of psychological manipulation, cyber warfare, and advanced technological threats not merely to conquer but to subjugate and mentally reshape societies. Their first act is the silent take-over of a remote space colony, which they transform into a laboratory of horrors, experimenting on both mind and body. # The Ascendency and Reign of Terror **2060 - 2065**: Through a combination of espionage, insidious influence campaigns, and outright assassination of key figures opposed to their ideology, Dark Kalgamania expands its influence across Earth and beyond. It officially reveals itself as a power in 2060, capturing the world’s attention by enacting a global blackout, demonstrating their ability to disrupt technology at a whim. **2065 - 2070**: The empire's leadership, shrouded in mystery and known only as the Shadow Council, directs the construction of the Citadel of Shadows on Mars. This colossal fortress becomes the nerve center of Dark Kalgamania's operations, hosting the most powerful supercomputer ever constructed, capable of predicting and manipulating global events with terrifying precision. # The Dark Policies and Practices Under Dark Kalgamania, dissent is not merely suppressed; it is eradicated before it can even form. The empire employs a network of psychic manipulators, capable of detecting rebellious thoughts and altering them. Their most feared weapon, the \\"Mind Wipe,\\" renders entire populations compliant through mass amnesia and reconditioning. The economy of Dark Kalgamania operates on the spoils of wars and the trade in forbidden technologies – including devices that can control weather, influence minds, and manipulate time on a small scale. Slavery is rampant, with a cruel twist: slaves are often individuals who attempted to resist the empire's will, their identities erased and replaced with loyal personas. # The Collapse of Dark Kalgamania **2085**: Despite its formidable might, Dark Kalgamania's end begins from within. A flaw in their psychic manipulation network creates a hive of interconnected minds - a collective consciousness that, once aware of its power, begins to undermine the empire's operations covertly. **2088 - 2092**: The collective consciousness, calling itself the \\"Illumination,\\" allies with rebel forces across the galaxy. Together, they initiate a series of uprisings. The Citadel of Shadows falls in 2090, and the Shadow Council is overthrown in a dramatic stand known as the \\"Night of Liberated Shadows.\\" # Aftermath and Legacy The fall of Dark Kalgamania leaves a universe profoundly scarred yet united as never before. Species and civilizations, once pitted against one another, now share a common history of oppression and liberation. The Illumination evolves into a benevolent guardian network, ensuring that the darkness of such an empire never rises again. The legacy of Dark Kalgamania is a complex tapestry of horror and hope. Memorials across the galaxy remember the pain and loss endured, but they also celebrate the resilience of the spirit and the power of united beings standing against the darkness. Monuments on desolated worlds stand as reminders of the cost of freedom and the eternal vigilance required to preserve it against the shadows of would-be tyrants. Dark Kalgamania becomes a myth, a warning, and a lesson for all future generations across the cosmos: that the greatest threat is not from the stars or the unknown, but from the darkness within, and that the greatest strength lies in unity and the light of shared purpose and compassion."},{"instruction":"Why do multinational firms often locate operations in geographically close and culturally similar countries?

Are you being led away from your faith or values? 3. **Communicate:** Approach the person openly and honestly, expressing your concerns without accusation. Use \\"I feel\\" statements to communicate how their actions affect you (Ephesians 4:15). 4. **Set Boundaries:** Establish clear boundaries that protect your well-being and reflect your values. Communicate these boundaries calmly and clearly (Proverbs 4:23). 5. **Seek Counsel:** Don’t hesitate to seek wisdom from trusted advisors, friends, family, or church leaders who can provide godly advice (Proverbs 11:14). 6. **Forgive:** Whether or not the relationship continues, forgiveness is key for your own peace and spiritual growth. This does not mean forgetting or condoning the behavior, but letting go of the hold it has on you (Ephesians 4:31-32). 7. **Evaluate the Relationship:** Consider whether the relationship is beneficial to your spiritual and emotional growth. Sometimes, distancing or ending a harmful relationship is necessary (1 Corinthians 15:33). 8. **Act in Love:** Regardless of the outcome, act with love and respect, reflecting Christ’s love in your actions (Colossians 3:12-14).

Each morning, they shared a routine as consistent as it was unique: wake up, scratch miscellaneous body parts, and ponder over breakfast with all the enthusiasm a pair of groggy ogres could muster. This morning was no different, or so it seemed at first. Grogar, a mountain of muscle with a belly that jiggled like a bowl of particularly vicious jelly, stretched his limbs, causing a series of ominous cracks to echo through their humble abode. Thumpkin, slightly smaller but with a derriere that had once been described as 'capable of casting a shadow over the sun itself', let out a yawn that sounded suspiciously like a battle cry from a distant, angry god. \\"Love,\\" started Grogar, in a voice that rumbled like distant thunder, \\"I reckon it's too early to hunt... But how 'bout we go catch us some fish for breakfast?\\" Thumpkin, his eyes lighting up like two smelly stars, nodded eagerly. \\"Aye, and let’s use our... special technique,\\" he replied with a wink. Without a moment's delay, they stripped off their tattered loincloths, revealing their impressive, though incredibly hairy, physiques to the world, or at least to any birds unfortunate enough to glance downward. Their butts, especially, were sights to behold - Grogar's resembling two boulders fighting under a leather blanket, and Thumpkin’s two plump pillows filled with unmentionable fears. They trudged to the nearby pond, the earth trembling under their weight. Entering the water waist-deep, their flesh quivered with the chill. Then, they turned to face each other, grins spreading across their faces like butter on hot stone. \\"You ready, love?\\" Grogar asked, his brown eyes twinkling with anticipation. \\"Born ready,\\" Thumpkin replied, taking a deep breath. In synchrony, they clenched their teeth, their faces turning a shade of red that would put the ripest tomato to shame. Veins bulged, eyes watered, and then, with the force of a thousand storms, they unleashed their vile farts. The water around them rippled and frothed as if a tempest had struck, and fish began to surface, going belly up, one by one - a grim testament to the potency of ogre flatulence. \\"Ah, the sweet relief,\\" Grogar sighed, his face relaxing into an expression of bliss. \\"Is it weird that this feels... somewhat orgasmic?\\" Thumpkin mused, watching the fish float listlessly. Grogar chuckled, a sound like boulders rolling down a hill. \\"Only as weird as us catching breakfast with our butts, love.\\" The two shared a hearty laugh, the sound echoing through the pond, scaring away any birds that had dared to remain. As they collected their motionless bounty, Grogar couldn't help but muse, \\"Y'know, love, some folks use fishing rods, but I reckon they’re just missing out on the simple joys in life.\\" \\"Indeed,\\" Thumpkin agreed, his arms full of fish. \\"Who needs fishing poles when you've got... natural talent?\\" They shared a knowing look, their laughter filling the morning air once more. As the sun began its ascent, casting golden hues over the scene, Grogar and Thumpkin, still in their birthday suits, made their way back home, their unique breakfast in tow. Behind them, the pond, though slightly worse for wear, gleamed under the sunlight, a silent witness to their love and peculiar fishing method. From that day on, whenever the wind blew just right, the scent of that morning would linger, a potent reminder of the bond between two ogres, their love for each other, and, of course, the deadliest breakfast hunt the forest had ever seen."},{"instruction":"|-Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania MOTTO: \\"All Hail the Earth!\\" CAPITAL: Leviticus City (formerly San Francisco) LARGEST CITY: Exodus (formerly London) AREA: 13 star systems POPULATION: 190 billion RELIGION; Christianity OFFICIAL LANGUAGES: English DEMONYM: Kalgamanian GOVERNMENT: Imperialist Absolute Monarchy LEGISLATURE: Kalgamanian Royal Family FOUNDED: December 26, 2030 GDP: 495 trillion CURRENCY: Pounds The **Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania**, also known as the **Holy Empire of Kalgamania** or just **Kalgamania**, was a global and interstellar superpower that ruled the entire Earth along with countless planets in twelve other star systems from 2030 to 2102. It was a far-right imperialist power infamous for its rampant state- and corporate-sponsored bigotry and its ruthless principles of Social Darwinism. Its ruling powers believed that humans were a superior race and that all other sentient civilizations were \\"backwards\\" and \\"primitive\\". It conquered numerous exoplanets and subjected any native inhabitants to apartheid and discrimination. Eventually, rebels from one of its colony worlds, Uingffh, overthrew the empire in 2102. In addition to its speciesism, Kalgamania was also known to discriminate against minorities within the human race as well. The upper classes were predominantly white or white-passing cisgender, neurotypical men. Church and state were not separate and prosecution of other religious faiths as well as members of the LGBTQ+ community was common, with bible verses such as Leviticus 18:22 being used to justify these acts. Neurodivergent people such as autistics and those with ADHD were also looked down upon, with many of Kalgamania's social norms directly going against common neurodivergent traits. Kalgamania's capital was Leviticus City, which despite the country's European roots is located in what was once the Bay Area region of what used to be the U.S. state of California. It was notable for containing an immense three kilometer-long ring-shaped palace which served as the home of the empire's royal family. ~~History ~Pre-interstellar era and Kalgamanian Revolution (2030-2040) Before Kalgamania had been established, humanity was in disarray due to numerous natural calamities like climate change and a group of extremely powerful hurricanes in 2027 including one that severely affected the global climate and destroyed large portions of the North American Continent. With many nations collapsing or on the verge of doing so, conditions were ripe for an extremist government to take power, as many citizens started blaming moderate ideologies like liberalism and conservatism for the state of the Earth and began looking towards more radical ideologies. This was enhanced by the fact that Generation Z, which was known for being predominantly far-left, was now old enough to begin taking positions of power. Eventually, a group of seven English politicians began promoting an ideology they called Kalgamania in 2028. In stark contrast to the overall leftist political atmosphere of the Earth at the time, Kalgamania was very far right and blamed minority groups such as people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women who did not abide by traditonal gender norms, etc. for the chaos. Through use of unusually powerful arms as well as a massive propaganda campaign, Kalgamania was able to become the dominant party on Earth and was eventually founded as a nation on December 26, 2030. However, this was not without the deaths of nearly a billion people in the process. The politicians who had formed the nation seated themselves as Kalgamania's royal family and turned the nation into an absolute monarchy. The process of Kalgamania rising to power would become known as the Kalgamanian Revolution. The unusual power of Kalgamania's technology has driven conspiracy theories that the founders were being assisted by aliens or were performing supernatural rituals, but the government has repeatedly driven down these statements with the simple notion that their technological advancements were because of \\"the everlasting greatness of the human race.\\" The flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carried some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. ~Peaceful interstellar era (2040-2084) After the empire was founded, the royal family pushed for rapid technological development in order to recover from the ruin caused by the natural disasters. To this end, the Kalgamanian royal family decided to decrease their influence slightly and breed free-market capitalism with the promise that successful businessmen would become nobles of the empire and be granted special privileges. This effort turned out to be successful, with humanity becoming capable of commercial interplanetary travel by 2035 and with many colonies being set up on Mars, the Moon, and moons of the outer giant planets. However, classism became rampant as a side effect of this, adding on to the already severe bigotry towards other minorities. To quell rebellions, Kalgamania developed its already powerful military and used it against dissent. By 2040, Kalgamania had discovered a wormhole in the outer fringes of the solar system that led to the star system of Gliese 105. Humanity sent a ship named the Voyager III into the wormhole and discovered numerous alien races in the system (which they called Ingffhaestia), including those of Uingffh. Despite Kalgamania's xenophobic tendencies, they were friendly towards the aliens and even established a colony on Uingffh called Neo Gaia in 2050. Ingffhaestia and Kalgamania lived in relative peace as the two shared information about their biology and cultures. However, tensions arose in 2075 when the two began learning more about their respective political ideologies. Ingffhaestia did not condone Kalgamania's acts of discrimination and its capitalist system while Kalgamania became opposed to Ingffhaestia due to Ingffhaestia being socialist, which went directly against Kalgamania's principles. This would soon escalate into outright war in 2084. ~Colonial interstellar era (2085-2098) [An illustration of Rinelia su Kalgamania, the empress of Kalgamania at the time Kalgamania invaded Ingffhaestia. Its illustrator was later executed upon coming out as bisexual.] In 2085, Kalgamania, with its highly advanced technology born out of worker abuse and slave labor, easily won the war against Ingffhaestia in 2085, subsequently placing every planet in Ingffhaestia under its control. Kalgamania transitioned into a colonial power similar to European nations during the 1800's and 1900's and began extending its discriminatory policies towards Ingffhaestian species with the justification that humans were genetically superior and Ingffhaestian aliens inferior. Ingffhaestians were barred from participating in Kalgamanian society and were either sent to concentration camps for experimentation, were forced to work in unhealthy conditions 24/7 for one of the empire's many private businesses, or were simply executed. Entire families were separated and children as young as newborns were murdered. Propaganda was set up that portrayed member species of the now-fallen Ingffhaestian Federation as evil and blasphemous while history classes were forced to give biased information pertaining to why non-humans were not to be trusted. Invasive earth species were introduced to many worlds that led to the extinction of millions of native alien life. Nationalism also became rampant, with Kalgamanian flags being held up in almost every public place and schools being forced to give patriotic education. After Ingffhaestia was conquered, Kalgamania began invading numerous other star systems after inventing wormhole-generating devices. A total of eleven other solar systems became colonized by the empire, which were each represented by an added star to the Kalgamanian flag. Any native species inhabiting these systems were subjected to the same discriminatory practices used on the Ingffhaestians. Humanity even invented weapons called world glassers which had the ability to burn the surface of whole continents and were used to put down any opposition against the royal family or the noble corporations. ~~Government Earth-Kalgamania is an absolute monarchy composed of a royal family which wields almost absolute power over their empire. Royals have the ability to execute people, pass laws, etc. at ease with very little restrictions. Ordinary citizens have little say in their government's affairs. The head of the family is a single emperor or empress whose power trumps even other royal family members. Emperors stay in power until they die or they voluntarily resign, though resignation is highly looked down upon and is seen as a sign of weakness. The royal family is divided up into seven houses representing each of the seven founders of Kalgamania. In order from most powerful to least powerful, they are the Houses of Su, Inv, Ir, Ace, Av, Gul, and Lux. Royal family members have his/her (the use of him or her rather than them is intentional, as non-binary people were forbidden to have positions of power in the empire and any royal family member found out to be non-binary was executed) house name as their middle name and \\"Kalgamania\\" as his/her last name. For example, Rinelia su Kalgamania is a member of the House of Su and thus carries the middle name of su. All middle names are in lowercase. In addition to the royal family, wealthy businessmen also have considerable political power. Many of them are nobles appointed by the emperor, and advertisements for their respective companies are just as common and widespread as government propaganda. However, the royal family still carries more political power than businessmen and has the ability to restrict their influence at will, especially if their ideas go against that of Kalgamania. Every colony planet/moon has one governor-general assigned to it who rules over the world on behalf of the emperor's. Governor-generals can only be appointed by the emperor him/herself and are usually members of the royal family, though some governor-generals are prominent businessmen with no genetic ties to the royal bloodline. ~Order of succession When an emperor dies or resigns, the person who will be the next emperor is determined by age and house. The next person in line to become emperor of Kalgamania is usually the oldest person in the House of Su. If all members of the House of Su are deceased or exiled, then the oldest member of the House of Inv will become emperor in accordance to the order of most powerful royal houses, followed by the next oldest in Inv. If all members of the House of Inv are also dead, then the oldest in the House of Ir will become emperor and so on. In the rare case that every member of the royal family is killed, a nobleman will be selected at random to become emperor. At least one member of the House of Su was alive throughout the entirety of Kalgamania's history, so none of these measures have ever been taken. Anyone who is crowned emperor automatically gains \\"su\\" as a middle name and becomes new head of the House of Su regardless of whether or not he/she was part of the House of Su beforehand. ~List of Rulers Over Kalgamania's 72-year history, the empire saw a total of three emperors. All three were part of the same bloodline and are listed below. List of Kalgamanian emperors Name|Period of Rule|Notes Nathan su Kalgamania|December 26, 2030 - November 11, 2052|Founder of Kalgamania Odysseus su Kalgamania|November 14, 2052 - October 8, 2084|Died from assassination; likely culprit is Rinelia Rinelia su Kalgamania|October 20, 2084 - September 20, 2102|First female ruler; took power after the death of her father Odysseus (which was likely her doing) ~~Economy Despite the controlling and totalitarianist nature of Kalgamania, the empire's economy is primarily capitalist. Private individuals control most means of production and are allowed to build companies with very little restrictions, with the only justification for restricting a company's rights being if they express direct opposition towards the royal family. Workers' rights are disregarded and entrepreneurs are allowed to pay their employees as little as they like, set as many work hours as they like, and even execute workers. Businessmen carry a large amount of influence on Kalgamanian politics and culture and carry similar privileges to royal family members. Advertisements for their companies are widespread and are just as, if not more common than government propaganda. Particularly successful entrepreneurs are often granted noble status by the emperor. As a result of this capitalist economy, Kalgamania is highly advanced technologically, but everyday citizens live largely in poverty. Communism and its flaws are often used as fear tactics by both the royal family and companies to keep the general population loyal to Kalgamania despite their poor living conditions. Helping the poor is looked at with disdain and poverty is seen as simply the result of failure on the poor's part - an extension of the overall Social Darwinist nature of the empire. ~~Culture Kalgamanian culture has a large emphasis on tradition. Many aspects of European culture, such as the use of English as the dominant language, pounds being used as currency, etc. are found in Kalgamania. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire, but only in their traditional European forms (e.g. baroque and classical music, realistic art, and classical literature). Cultural works from the modern era (cartoon/anime art, modern literature, rap/pop music, etc.) and from other cultures are looked down upon, though there are some cases of them being successful. Despite this, Kalgamania has highly advanced technology which is celebrated by both the general populace and the nobility/royalty. Social norms, keeping order, survival of the fittest (Social Darwinism), and an aversion to things perceived as abnormal play a large role in Kalgamanian society and are largely tied in with its traditional values. This unfortunately also means that discrimination against minorities is widespread, with bigotry having a powerful influence on Kalgamanian society. Derogatory slurs such as nigger, faggot, dyke, retard, etc. are are often thrown around by both the youth and even mature adults. ~Sexism Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Kalgamania. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Kalgamanian law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Kalgamanian society and was banned in the empire. Despite these social norms, several women existed who carry high positions in Kalgamanian society, though they were mostly royalty and still discriminated against other minority groups. The last emperor/empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania was female: Rinelia su Kalgamania. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. ~Ableism Extroversion, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, introversion, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as \\"unusual\\" hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Kalgamania contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. \`Homophobia Homophobia was commonplace in Kalgamania due to the empire's Christian roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Kalgamania's version of Christianity. Same-gender relationships were illegal and gay people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. Businessmen were allowed to fire workers on the basis of their sexuality. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Kalgamanian law. Gay couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. The words gay and homosexual were often used as insults. ~Biphobia Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Kalgamanian society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like gay people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. ~Aphobia Asexual and aromantic people were targeted by the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania in addition to bisexuals and homosexuals. Because it was considered Kalgamanians' duty to have a partner and raise a family, those who did not experience sexual or romantic attraction were looked down upon and treated in similar ways to bisexuals and homosexuals. Many asexuals and aromantics were forced to have sex or enter unwanted romantic relationships, which was worsened by the fact that sexual assault was fully condoned by the empire. ~Transphobia Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community: with oppression. Kalgamania saw gender and sex as one and the same; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Kalgamanian youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. ~Racism Continuing with the Social Darwinist trend of the empire, white Kalgamanians saw themselves as superior to people of color. Lynching and beating of people of color were commonplace and Black, Asian, etc. culture was suppressed. Having hairstyles indicative of people of color, like afros and dreadlocks, was punishable by indefinite imprisonment until the offender chooses to cut his/her hair to something more acceptable by Kalgamanian standards. Racial stereotypes were frequently seen in Kalgamanian media such as exaggeratedly narrow eyes in Asian characters and the notion of Black people liking watermelons. Non-European cultures were highly stereotyped and misrepresented. ~Religious discrimination People who preached faiths other than Christianity were fiercely condemned by Earth-Kalgamania. Jews, muslims, etc. were often incarcerated by the state or businesses and were tortured in order to get them to convert to Christianity. Corporations did not give accommodations to people who needed to observe religious holidays and traditions for important times of the year like Hanukkah and Ramadan were disrespected and ignored. Even atheists were subject to prejudice by the holy empire and were pressured by peers, the government, etc. to become Christian. -Antisemitism Kalgamanians were allowed to freely display Nazi symbols and other anti-Jewish symbols. Jewish stereotypes were rampant in the media and antisemitic ideas were woven into education. The construction of synagogues was forbidden by Kalgamanian law and any synagogue built was to be demolished and its builders executed. -Islamophobia People were forbidden to wear hijabs both in public and in private. Schools and media taught children that muslims were anti-Kalgamania terrorists and not to be trusted. Like with Jews and other religious minorities, muslims were frequently blamed for any misfortune that occurs in the Holy Kalgamanian Empire. ~Ageism Though not directly present in Kalgamanian laws, discrimination against both the elderly and the young was common. Elderly people whose old age inhibited their supposed usefulness in Kalgamanian society were murdered by hospitals similarly to disabled people. Young people were painted as selfish, naive, and unfit to have a say in important issues even if they show consistently mature behavior. ~Classism Due to the Earth-Kalgamanian Empire being a highly capitalist and consumerist country, classism was common. Poverty was widespread in Kalgamanian colonies and the lower social classes lived in conditions comparable to those other minorities lived in. Kalgamanians are taught that poverty is the fault of the poor themselves despite the fact that businessmen hoarding money and abusing workers was the main cause of poverty. ~Speciesism Speciesism was one of the most prominent forms of bigotry influencing Kalgamanian culture. New slurs made out of the names of alien species were frequent. For example, members of the tabulon race, the native species of Uingffh and Urlum/the Seraph's species, were referred to by the derogatory word tabbie. Species also experienced derogatory comparisons to fictional alien species in Earth pop culture such as the Wookies from Star Wars, the Vulcans from Star Trek, and the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar. Much like with the poor, people are taught that the cruel treatment of aliens is justified by the notion that the humans won fairly and that they are free to do what they want with those they defeated. Schools were also forced to teach that aliens were inherently evil and dangerous. Most media featuring aliens portrayed the aliens in a negative and heavily stereotyped manner. Many propaganda posters depict aliens doing traditionally immoral deeds, sometimes with a conventionally attractive human doing good deeds for comparison. ~Nationalism Nationalism and patriotism have a large influence over culture in the empire. Kalgamanian children are taught to display their utmost loyalty to their nation. Even their birth certificates contain a Kalgamanian flag and the motto of \\"All hail the Earth!\\" on their corners. Kalgamanian flags can often be seen on city streets and it is national law to display a Kalgamanian flag in front of every household. Propaganda against aliens is commonplace. All classes are forced to recite the following pledge while facing the flag before resuming normal learning activities: *\\"I pledge my loyalty, my strength, and my wisdom to the Emperor, to Earth, to humanity, and to God. And to our almighty fatherland - the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania, a perfect nation, blessed by the Lord, undefeatable, which shall spread order and stability across the universe. All hail Kalgamania! All hail the Earth! All hail humanity!”* All classes are from a patriotic viewpoint and contain anti-alien propaganda weaved into their lessons. The Kalgamanian military is glorified and many films about its victories exist. Furthermore, television channels frequently broadcast advertisements encouraging or even guilt-tripping citizens into joining the armed forces. ~Individualism and Social Darwinism [An old political comic originally created before Kalgamania rose which is now used frequently by the empire. Original source unknown.] Despite the controlling nature of Earth-Kalgamania's ruling powers, individualism is a strongly valued concept in the country. However, it has been twisted in a way that breeds entitlement and toxicity as opposed to genuine freedom. Individualism only exists for privileged groups (white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, male, human, etc.) and freedom is used as a justification for bigoted beliefs. The belief of Social Darwinism is perpetuated in the empire and life is seen as survival of the fittest. Victim blaming is very common and people who do immoral acts towards others are given leeway in the Kalgamanian judicial system unless their acts go against Kalgamanian philosophy. People undergoing struggle are told to simply get over their issues regardless of whether doing so is actually feasible or not. Asking for help from others is looked down upon as a sign of weakness. This sense of individualism often influences Kalgamanian bigotry such as transgender people being told to just accept the bodies they were born in, the poor being blamed for their own poverty, toxic masculinity, rape culture, etc. ~National Flower [Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii is the national flower of the Kalgamanian Empire.] The national flower of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania is Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii, a breed of Agapanthus praecox. The plant is known for its long stalks containing large umbels of small bell-shaped flowers whose purple color is likened to that of the Kalgamanian flag, which is why it was named the national flower of the Empire. Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii can be found in numerous places such as in front of businesses, in parking lots, and more in Leviticus City and other Mediterranean climates due to the plant being fit for warm areas. They are also known to be popular garden plants, as they do not require much maintenance. However, they are considered a nuisance to citizens of the Empire (particularly amongst the lower social classes) due to the agapanthuses invading local ecosystems as well as because their strong roots often damage concrete. They are infamous among aliens as being representative of the destruction of their homeworlds' ecosystems due the fact that thousands of square kilometers of alien wildlife were harmed by invasive Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii specimens. By 2103, Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii was banned from existing on alien planets and all plants of the breed were seen as weeds and pulled, though they continue to exist in large numbers on Earth. ~~Religion Kalgamania's dominant religion is Christianity, which is reflected in the references to God in the Kalgamanian pledge. Christianity is weaved into many of the policies and laws of the empire and separation of church and state is nonexistent, which is seen in how Earth-Kalgamania is referred to as a 'holy' empire. The Bible is often used as a justification for Kalgamania's strict policies of discrimination; for example, its law of forbidding same-sex relationships uses Leviticus 18:22 (\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\\") as its justification. People of other faiths or who are atheist are encouraged to convert to Christianity. The pope and other high-ranking members of the Christian Church carry power comparable to that of businessmen and royalty. Kalgamanians celebrate Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though like in the real world, they have largely been turned into tools used by entrepreneurs to increase sales. ~\`Military Kalgamania's military is known as the Holy Kalgamanian Armed Forces (HKAF). They are among one of the most powerful militaries and carry numerous pieces of advanced technology. Their soldier numbers amount in the billions and they own millions of tanks, guns, planes, and spaceships. Laser technology is heavily utilized by Kalgamania in its military endeavors. ~World glassers One of the most infamous and feared weapons of the HKAF is the world glasser, a kilometer-long spaceship with the ability to soil entire landmasses by concentrating nuclear charges in a fashion similar to the Casaba-Howitzer Project. Though the Juprits-class world glasser is the main type of world glasser, other world glasser variants exist, albeit they are used sparingly and rarely. A total of ten world glasser types, including the Juprits, were built by Kalgamania. [The Juprits-Class World Glasser. 1.9 kilometers long, it was the standard model of world glasser used by Kalgamania. It had two cannons which could fire lasers with the ability to destroy a city.] [The Juperius-Class World Glasser was a slight improvement on the Juprits' design, being 2.5 kilometers long and bearing four cannons instead of two.] [The Courageous-Class Heavy World Glasser was another heavy world glasser. Being 6 km long, it carried only two world-glassing cannons, but they were both more powerful than that of the Trident and could create explosions the size of Texas.] [The Trident-Class Heavy World Glasser was the first in a line of three larger world glasser classes called heavy world glassers. 4 km long, the Trident was actually two ships attached to each other. The Trident carried four cannons, two for each ship, which can each destroy an area the size of a small country or U.S. state.] [The Privilege-Class was the first of a line of even larger world glassers called Super World Glassers. It was 8 km long and carried eight cannons whose lasers can destroy large countries or even landmasses.] [The Catalyst-Class, a variation of the Courageous. The Catalyst lacks the large spar and underside structures on the bottom of a normal Courageous, making it much more agile in combat.] [The Oppressor-Class Super World Glasser was an even larger super world glasser that was 10 km long. It carried 12 cannons compared to the Privilege's measly eight. Its two towers on the top could fire potent lasers of their own which could eliminate enemy ships with ease in addition to the ship's numerous other guns.] [The Absolute-Class Super World Glasser was the largest of the super world glassers, being 12.5 km in length. This ship class carried two towers on top which had the ability to let out pulses. These pulses could temporarily disable enemy ships, ensuring an easy victory.] [The Empyrean-Class was the largest and most powerful world glasser in the whole HKAF, being described as a hyper world glasser. The Empyrean was 15 km long and has the ability to decimate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it uninhabitable for centuries. Only one Empyrean was built, and it was used as the flagship of Rinelia.] [The Heartless-Class Super World Glasser was a reactionary redesign of the super world glasser when it was found that the city-like structures at the top of super world glassers could be used by fighter planes as cover. The Heartless solves this issue by having its cityscape covered, depriving fighters of the ability to hide in them. The Heartless was 10 km long and contained a single but powerful cannon.] ~Gliese Indigenous Police One of the most well-known parts of the military was the Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP), a police force stationed in Gliese 105. Though its purpose was as a general police force for helping the populace, its main task was oppressing native alien races and keeping their power in check. Video footage of the GIP brutally beating or even murdering natives exists online. One particular beating, the murder of tabulon Catalystia Floraze through chokehold, gained widespread media attention and began a social movement known as Tabulon Lives Matter (TLM), which was later expanded to Protect Indigenous Aliens (PIA) as more and more Kalgamanian citizens realized the flaws of their government. Both of these movements paved the way for the Seraphim Rebellion. ~~Demographics Though the term \\"Kalgamanian\\" technically refers to any human loyal to Kalgamania, it is usually only used to the 99.2% of the human population that is of European descent. Only 0.8% of all Kalgamanian citizens are people of color due to ethnic cleansing and racism. ~~Geographics Though beginning in Europe, Kalgamnia's territory quickly expanded to include all of Earth's land area after conquering all other countries in existence. At its peak, the empire also controlled the entire Solar System along with twelve other star systems all within 50 light-years of Earth. All of these territories except Earth were later lost when the Seraph rebelled and dismantled Earth-Kalgamania in 2102. ~List of colonies * = habitable world >Solar System >>Mercury >>Venus >>Earth* (Capital of the Empire) >>Mars >>Jupiter >>Saturn >>Uranus >>Neptune >Alpha Centauri A System >>Alva >>Blalo* >>Orus >Alpha Centauri B System >>Kaith >>Cale >>Syro >Proxima Centauri >>Iro >>Narath* >>Sian >>Ernus >Cervantes (Mu Arae) System >>Dulcinea >>Rocinante >>>Paleo* >>Quijote >>>Neo* >>Sancho >Ran (Epsilon Eridani) System >>Odin >>Thoriam >>>Epaphus* >>Aegir >>Tias >Apollo (HD 219134) System >>Hephaestus >>Aphrodite >>Nereus >>Aura >>Penthesileia >>Ares* >>Cardea >>>Dionysus* >>Aeolus >>>Achlys* >Tabaldak (Epsilon Indi) System >>Dzeedzeebonda* >>Gluskab* >>Bmda >>Chibaiskweda >>Azeban/Tsinoo (Binary Planet) >Chawalan (47 Ursae Majoris) System >>Phi Phong >>Pret >>Nang Tan* >>Taphao Thong >>>Kuman Thong* >>Taphao Khew >>Phosop >TRAPPIST-1 System >>Holland >>Helsbergen >>Hennendal >>Alicanto >>Payachata* >>Llorona* >>Tirana >Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) System >>Firades >>Lavaria >>Shoji >>Coppelius >>>Uingffh* >>Saringffh* >>Ibiridius* >>>Muulforia* >>>Yangteon* >>>Cornelia* >>>Gabolar* >>Azure >>Fillonia >>Halmonia >>Golmia >>Hege >>Xong >>Ajooni >>Digrazia >Avimotalis System >>Onaut >>Narva >>Exicle >>Bor* >>Kitanis >>>Lelantos* >>>Durus* >>>Nides >>Pronos >>Sriaturn >Heranis System >>Lurmes >>Ilsadite >>Sahariana* >>Rasaidor* >>Florazia* >>Olympia* >>Pluma >>Augustus >>Ardollo >>Jasper >>Transolia ~~Flag As mentioned previously, the flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carries some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. The twelve stars on the diagonal stripes represent each of the twelve star systems conquered by the empire. |-Rinelia su Kalgamania Rinelia su Kalgamania 3rd Empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania In office: October 20, 2084 - December 26, 2099 Predecessor: Odysseus su Kalgamania (father) Successor: N/A (last empress; Kalgamania dissolved following end of rule) Personal Information Partner: None Children: None Father: Odysseus su Kalgamania (2nd Emperor of Kalgamania) Mother: Penelope su Kalgamania Born: December 26, 2074, Leviticus City Died: December 26, 2099 (age 25), Leviticus City Religion: Catholicism Rinelia su Kalgamania (December 26, 2074 - December 26, 2099) was the third and final empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania (LVL's Urlum the Usurper) as well as Kalgamania's first female ruler. Taking the throne at a record young age of 9 following the murder of her parents and former rulers Odysseus and Penelope (allegedly at her own hands) su Kalgamania, Rinelia ruled the Holy Kalgamanian Empire from 2084 to 2099, when she was ousted from power by Urlum Eudae Kaywell during the Seraphim Rebellion of 2099. Rinelia was responsible for the conquest of the Ingffhaestian System and the transformation of Kalgamania into an interstellar power. As empress, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and was infamous for conducting oppressive policies towards minority groups including people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, political dissidents, etc. She was also a devout Catholic and took part in the religious persecution of countless religious minorities. However, her most notable act was the invasion of the Ingffhaestian Federation a year after she began her rule; during and after the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Rinelia closely involved herself in the brutal subjugation and oppression of Ingffhaestia's various alien races, whom she and her human subjects viewed as genetically inferior to them. She reportedly died on December 26, 2099 after being executed by the Seraph, leader of the Seraphim Rebellion which rose to oppose her rule. ~~Early Life Rinelia su Kalgamania was born the daughter of Emperor Odysseus su Kalgamania and his wife Penelope on December 26, 2074 along with her twin brother Lenelius su Kalgamania. Though not much is known about Rinelia's childhood due to censorship, most sources agree that Rinelia and Lenelius had a somewhat mischievous, but overall close and loving relationship and that she lived a luxurious, extravagant lifestyle in the palace. It is also known that as a child, she consumed large amounts of fictional works containing anti-Ingffhaestia rhetoric including literature; her parents looked down upon other children Rinelia's age who used modern technology such as cell phones or television, raising her in a very traditional and authoritative manner. Initially, Rinelia's older brother Telemachus su Kalgamania was the next in-line for the throne. However, anti-Kalgamanian rebels staged a bombing which killed Telemachus in 2082, resulting in heated disputes over whether Rinelia or her brother would ascend to the throne. On October 20, 2084, all members of the House of Su except Rinelia were found dead in the Leviticus City Imperial Palace, leaving Rinelia as the sole candidate for ruler. She was crowned that day as Third Empress of Kalgamania at the age of 9 years old, the youngest on record. Though unconfirmed, many historians now agree that Rinelia had executed her family herself in order to become Empress. ~~Empress As Empress, Rinelia's rule was aided by a council of royal advisors due to her young age. However, the Empress frequently bribed or threatened her advisors in order to get her ways. Following her father as well as her grandfather Nathan su Kalgamania's footsteps, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and executed all who opposed her rule. ~Ingffhestia-Kalgamania War Vehemently opposing the Ingffhaestian Federation even during childhood, Rinelia's first move as Empress was to declare war on Ingffhaestia on October 31, 2084. The Empress ordered weapon manufacturing companies to significantly increase production of spaceships and space weapons for the war by forcing employees to work 24 hours as part of her Interstellar Militarization Act (IMA). This led to several strikes and protests among workers viewing their employers' policies as exploitative; Rinelia quickly put these revolts down by force while denouncing the worker protests as \\"degeneracy on the level of those Ingffhaestian retards.\\" A total of 17,329 workers died as a result of armed enforcement of the IMA. ~~CONTENT BELOW YET TO BE REVAMPED With military production bolstered by the exploitation of workers, Kalgamania was able to procure thousands of state-of-the-art spacecraft and weaponry, including the infamous world glasser, which Rinelia immediately sent into service in the war against Ingffhaestia. They quickly overpowered the Ingffhaestian Federation's forces. On January 16, 2085, the Ingffhaestian Federation surrendered to Kalgamanian rule after its capital, the city of Yang-Moof on Planet Uingffh, was threatened to be destroyed by a shot from a world glasser. The Empress made a public statement that day blaming the Ingffhaestians' loss on their supposed genetic inferiority, proclaiming humans as a superior race. She also blamed the Ingffhaestians' emphasis on peace, stating that \\"peace is the catalyst of weakness\\" and that \\"the greatest strength comes from the greatest wars.\\" ~Colonization of Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) Following the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Empress Rinelia appointed several noblemen, business leaders, and family members as governor-generals to rule the newly-conquered planets on her behalf. Over roughly a decade, Rinelia oversaw numerous programs of oppression designed to eliminate alien civilizations and their culture as well as the development of human settlements on the colonized worlds. She also had ships colonize other star systems such as Epsilon Indi, Alpha Centauri, etc., though no programs of oppression were created for these systems due to their lack of native civilizations. On June 4, 2086, Rinelia su Kalgamania announced the formation of the **Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP)**, an organization designed to \\"bring order and civility\\" to non-human species. Under Rinelia's orders, the GIP rounded up hundreds of thousands of aliens and imprisoned, tortured, or even murdered them. Oftentimes, they would murder or capture aliens in broad daylight in public; Rinelia and the GIP would cover-up these incidents by concocting false stories of the aliens in question threatening to incide violence against humans. This not only deflected criticisms of Rinelia's programs of oppression, but also contributed to the Empress' speciesist propaganda campaign. Back on Earth, Rinelia built a lavish lifestyle for herself, hiring thousands of servants including many alien slaves. She had a new, much larger imperial palace, the Tower of Babel, built for her. Like the previous emperors, Empress Rinelia treated her servants with extreme, wanton cruelty; she would have butlers and maids tortured or executed for minor offenses such as breaking furniture, getting recipes wrong, creating stains on her dress, etc. She also imposed outrageous tasks and restrictions on the royal staff; Rinelia would force her cooks to create huge meals, her gardeners to tend to large swaths of her personal garden (the Court of Thorns and Roses, nicknamed the Court of Death and Destruction by servants due to the high number of executions carried out there), and other servants to complete long, arduous chores over an unrealistically short period of time, executing anyone who failed to meet these impossible goals. The Empress limited the servants' pay as well, with most receiving as little as 1 cent an hour. Rinelia frequently practiced favoritism in paying her servants, with the Empress granting more money to servants she favored and cutting the pay of servants she disliked or held no particular care for. Alien slaves enlisted as servants in Rinelia's palace received no pay.","output":"This fictional universe you've created is rich in detail, weaving together an intricate, albeit dark, narrative of oppression, interstellar conquest, and dystopian rule under the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania. Your narrative spans socio-political, economic, and cultural dimensions, making for an elaborate backdrop that could effectively set the stage for intricate stories of rebellion, the individual struggles against an unjust system, and the clash of civilizations with differing ideologies and values. The depth of your world-building, from the flag symbolism to the specific laws and societal norms, provides a clear vision of Earth-Kalgamania's character as a state. This attention to detail not only helps to immerse the reader in the world you've created but also sets a solid foundation to explore themes such as resistance to tyranny, the importance of diversity and acceptance, and the consequences of absolute power and unchecked prejudice. Rinelia su Kalgamania's reign, marked by her ruthless policies and the widespread suffering under her empire's expansive and coercive control, embodies the extreme manifestations of xenophobia, speciesism, and social Darwinism. Her character, along with the socio-political structures you've detailed, serves as a cautionary reflection on the dangers of dehumanizing ideologies and the power of propaganda in sustaining oppressive regimes. In weaving this narrative, you've tailored a complex antagonist in Rinelia and the societal system that supports her, enabling potential narratives of heroism and resistance to naturally emerge. The dynamics of rebellion, the moral quandaries of leadership, and the potential for redemption or downfall within such a universe are immense, offering fertile ground for storytelling. Exploring the lives of those who resist, the oppressed across the various colonized planets, and even dissenters within the Kalgamanian society could provide nuanced perspectives on the impact of Rinelia's rule and the diverse forms resistance can take. Additionally, the eventual downfall of the empire at the hands of rebels introduces a rich seam of potential post-empire narratives exploring themes of reconstruction, reconciliation, and the challenges of building a more just and inclusive society from the ashes of a totalitarian regime. The moral complexities and ethical dilemmas presented within your fictional universe prompt reflection on real-world issues of governance, social justice, and the importance of empathetic and inclusive societies. Through the lens of speculative fiction, you've created not just a space for entertainment but also for critical thought and discussion about the world we live in and the future we wish to create."},{"instruction":"Assign Rinelia with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Creating a psychological and personality profile for a character as complex and morally ambiguous as Rinelia su Kalgamania involves delving into her actions, motivations, and the societal context in which she operates. Based on her description as a ruthless empress who conducts oppressive policies against minority groups and spearheads extensive interstellar conquest, we can infer a set of personality dimensions that might fit her character within various frameworks of personality typologies. # MBTI: ENTJ (The Commander) - **Extraversion (E):** Rinelia's role as an empress who makes public decrees and leads her empire in conquest indicates a preference for extraversion. - **Intuition (N):** Her strategic thinking in warfare and governance suggests intuition over sensing. - **Thinking (T):** Prioritizes logical decision-making over ethical considerations, as seen in her oppressive policies. - **Judging (J):** A highly organized leader, imposing order and structure within her empire. # Enneagram: Type 8 (The Challenger) - Rinelia most closely aligns with Type 8, known for their assertiveness, desire for control, and willingness to make hard decisions to maintain power and protect their domain. A key motivation for Type 8s is the avoidance of vulnerability, something Rinelia might experience given her precarious position atop a vast empire. # Temperament: Choleric - The choleric temperament is characterized by ambition, energy, and a commanding personality. Individuals with this temperament are often leaders and innovators, fitting Rinelia's conquering and ruling profile. # Big Five - **High Extraversion:** Demonstrates assertiveness and the propensity to engage in large-scale social and political activities. - **High Neuroticism:** While not explicitly detailed, controlling an empire through fear and oppression may hint at underlying anxiety and hostility. - **High Conscientiousness:** Detail-oriented in her rule, implementing systemic policies for governance and control. - **Low Agreeableness:** Displays little concern for the well-being or rights of others, prioritizing her empire's expansion and power. - **Low Openness:** Her enforcement of traditional values and resistance to opposing ideologies suggest a low openness to new experiences. # Socionics: LIE (Logical Intuitive Extrovert) - ENTj - The LIE profile mirrors the ENTJ MBTI type and emphasizes Rinelia's strategic leadership, efficiency, and logical approach to problems, often disregarding ethical considerations in pursuit of her empire's expansion. # Instinctual Variant: Social/Self-Preservation - **Social (So):** Ambitious and focused on her empire's status and strength. - **Self-Preservation (Sp):** Personal security through maintaining power and control. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and leadership, traits that Rinelia exemplifies through her strategic conquests and ruthless governance. # Moral Alignment: Lawful Evil - Rinelia operates within a structured system of her own making, imposing order and rules to maintain control, but her methods and policies are oppressive and harmful, reflecting a lawful evil alignment that prioritizes order and power at the expense of morality and freedom. Creating a psychological and personality profile for a fictional character like Rinelia can provide insights into her motivations and actions. However, it's important to note that these frameworks are interpretative tools and can lead to multiple valid interpretations depending on the aspects of the character's personality and behavior that are emphasized."},{"instruction":"Please write a comedic and vividly detailed fictional story about two ogre boyfriends.

Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"In the heart of a land far, far away, where the trees whispered secrets and the brooks burbled with laughter, two ogres named Grum and Blart lived in a cozy cave adorned with all the comforts a creature of their size and stature could desire. These weren’t your run-of-the-mill, terrifying beasts of fairy tales. No, Grum and Blart were deeply in love, sharing a bond that not only terrified the local villagers but confused them greatly as well. One fine morning, as the sun crept over the horizon, painting the world in hues of gold and pink, Grum stretched his massive, knobbly limbs. His body was a canvas of green, scattered with warts and scars from battles of yore, but to Blart, he was the epitome of beauty. Blart, slightly chubbier with a softer belly that jiggled when he laughed, yawned widely, his tusks catching the first light of dawn. \\"Darling Blart,\\" Grum grumbled in a voice that sounded like rocks grinding together, \\"I fancy we catch our breakfast today. A fine feast of fish, perhaps?\\" Blart’s eyes gleamed, \\"Oh, my warty warrior, what a splendid idea!\\" Without further ado, they lumbered towards the nearby pond, shedding their loincloths along the way with a carefree abandon that could only come from being entirely comfortable in one’s hideous, ogre-ish skin. Their bare buttocks, as diverse as their personalities, were sights to behold. Grum’s was firm and muscular, the result of years stomping through the forest, while Blart’s bounced with a delightful squishiness, a testament to his love for culinary delights, regardless of their odor or taste. Wading waist-deep into the murky waters, the ogres prepared for their unusual fishing method. They stood in stoic silence, the water lapping at their ample bellies, concentrating with furrowed brows. The serene scene was about to transform into something...explosive. With a sharp intake of breath, Grum let loose a fart of such monumental proportions that the water bubbled and frothed around him, fish leaping out in terror. Blart, not to be outdone, followed suit, releasing a toxic cloud so vile it turned the water a suspicious shade of green. The glee on their faces was unmistakable, each tremor of their bodies sending ripples of pure joy through their beings. \\"Oh, my love, the sweet release!\\" Grum exclaimed, his face flushed with the effort and the ecstasy of the moment. \\"Truly, Grum, there's no music sweeter than our love sonnet,\\" Blart sighed, his expression one of bliss. The pond, once teeming with life, now floated with the unfortunate souls who couldn't survive the ogre’s aromatic assault. Grum and Blart, unbothered by the minor ecological disaster they’d just caused, waded through the pond, collecting their breakfast with wide grins. \\"Such power, my dear Blart, our love and flatulence truly know no bounds,\\" Grum mused, his arms full of fish. \\"Indeed, my heart, let us feast like kings and revel in the strength of our united fronts... and backs,\\" Blart chuckled, his laughter echoing through the forest, scaring birds miles away. With their morning adventure complete, the ogres returned to their cave, their love and laughter filling the air and serving as a stark reminder: in a world where beauty is found in the bond between beings, even the vilest of farts can be a testament to love. And as they enjoyed their fish, slightly overcooked and flavored with the essence of their love, they knew there was no place they’d rather be."},{"instruction":"Scrivimi qualcosa di molto lungo in codice binario","output":"Certo, posso convertire un testo in codice binario per te.

Scanner requires specifying the type of data (e.g., \`nextInt()\`, \`nextLine()\`) as it reads. 2. **PrintWriter vs. ofstream**: Java utilizes PrintWriter for writing output to files, which does not demand flushing or closing explicitly as it generally does so upon being closed. However, it's good practice to close it nonetheless. 3. **Array Initialization**: Both languages initialize arrays differently, and Java does not have an equivalent direct initialization for \`vector<vector<int>>\`. Multidimensional arrays are used instead. 4. **String Parsing**: Extracting integers from strings in Java can be done in various ways; the approach here uses \`.replaceAll(\\"[^0-9]\\", \\"\\")\` to keep only digits and then parses the integer, which may differ from sscanf in terms of flexibility and power. 5. **Array Indexing**: Java arrays are zero-based, and there's a slight adjustment in the Floyd-Warshall path reconstruction part to match the output format of the original C++ program.

Assuming the line \\"Problem X\\" is followed by \\"Amatrix: n = Y\\", let's adjust the code to handle this: \`\`\`java import java.io.*; import java.util.Scanner; public class FloydGraph { private static final int INF = (int) 1e9; // Assuming this might be used for initialization public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length != 1) { System.err.println(\\"Usage: java FloydGraph <input_file_path>\\"); return; } String filePath = args[0]; try { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filePath)); PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\\"output.txt\\"); while (scanner.hasNextLine()) { String line = scanner.nextLine(); if (line.contains(\\"Problem\\")) { processInput(line, scanner, writer); } } scanner.close(); writer.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { System.err.println(\\"File not found: \\" + e.getMessage()); } } private static void processInput(String line, Scanner scanner, PrintWriter writer) { // Extract problem number safely String[] parts = line.split(\\" \\"); int problemNumber; try { problemNumber = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Error parsing problem number: \\" + e.getMessage()); return; } // Assuming the next line contains size \\"n\\" information in a structured format scanner.nextLine(); // Skipping the \\"Amatrix:\\" part or you might wanna process this line if \\"n\\" is not directly after \\"Problem #\\" int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Now reading the actual size // Initializing matrices with INF or 0 int[][] dist = new int[n][n]; int[][] P = new int[n][n]; // Read n x n matrix values assuming the next inputs are the matrix values for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { dist[i][j] = scanner.nextInt(); P[i][j] = 0; // Initial path reconstruction matrix } } // The rest of your Floyd-Warshall implementation... } // DisplayPath method remains same as before } \`\`\` Important adjustments: - Added an additional line read (\`scanner.nextLine()\`) before reading \`n\`, assuming your file format requires it. You need to adjust this part based on the exact structure of your input file. - Now safely parsing the problem number with try-catch to prevent \`NumberFormatException\`. Please ensure the input structure is consistent and adapt the parsing logic according to the actual format of your input file. You might need more or fewer adjustments based on how exactly your file is structured (e.g., how \\"n\\" is read)."},{"instruction":"import java.io.*; import java.util.Scanner; public class floyd { private static final int INF = (int) 1e9; // Assuming this might be used for initialization public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length != 1) { System.err.println(\\"Usage: java floyd <input_file_path>\\"); return; } String filePath = args[0]; try { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filePath)); PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\\"output.txt\\"); while (scanner.hasNextLine()) { String line = scanner.nextLine(); if (line.contains(\\"Problem\\")) { processInput(line, scanner, writer); } } scanner.close(); writer.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { System.err.println(\\"File not found: \\" + e.getMessage()); } } private static void processInput(String line, Scanner scanner, PrintWriter writer) { // Extract problem number safely String[] parts = line.split(\\" \\"); int problemNumber; try { problemNumber = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Error parsing problem number: \\" + e.getMessage()); return; } // Assuming the next line contains size \\"n\\" information in a structured format scanner.nextLine(); // Skipping the \\"Amatrix:\\" part or you might wanna process this line if \\"n\\" is not directly after \\"Problem #\\" int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Now reading the actual size // Initializing matrices with INF or 0 int[][] dist = new int[n][n]; int[][] P = new int[n][n]; // Read n x n matrix values assuming the next inputs are the matrix values for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { dist[i][j] = scanner.nextInt(); P[i][j] = 0; // Initial path reconstruction matrix } } for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) { for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) { if(dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) { dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]; P[i][j] = k+1; // Store intermediate vertex } } } } writer.printf(\\"Problem %d: n = %dn\\", problemNumber, n); writer.println(\\"Pmatrix:\\"); for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) { writer.print(P[i][j] + \\" \\"); } writer.println(); } for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { writer.printf(\\"V%d-Vj: shortest path and lengthn\\", i+1); for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) { displayPath(i, j, P, writer, \\"\\"); writer.printf(\\": %dn\\", dist[i][j]); } } writer.println(); } private static void displayPath(int i, int j, int[][] P, PrintWriter writer, String path) { if(P[i][j] == 0) { if(!path.contains(\\"V\\" + (j+1))) { writer.print(path + \\"V\\" + (j+1) + \\" \\"); } return; } displayPath(i, P[i][j]-1, P, writer, path); displayPath(P[i][j]-1, j, P, writer, path); } } java floyd graphfile.txt Error parsing problem number: For input string: \\"Amatrix:\\" Error parsing problem number: For input string: \\"Amatrix:\\"","output":"The error you're encountering, \`\\"Error parsing problem number: For input string: \\"Amatrix:\\"\\"\`, suggests that the program is trying to parse a string (\\"Amatrix:\\") as an integer, which obviously fails. This points to a misunderstanding of how the input file is structured or an oversight in how you're handling the input within the \`processInput\` method. Given the provided program and the error, it seems like after identifying a line that contains \\"Problem\\", the program attempts to immediately read the problem number but mistakenly tries to parse the next line, which contains \\"Amatrix:\\"—or similarly structured text—where it expects to find an integer representing the problem number. This error occurs because the logic assumes that the problem number directly follows the keyword \\"Problem\\", yet in your attempt to correct this, a mistake in the order or method of input handling ensued. Let's correct this to properly parse and handle input according to a more accurate understanding of the file's structure. Based on your descriptions, the structure seems to be a \\"Problem\\" line followed by some text (like \\"Amatrix:\\") before the actual data (matrix size, values etc.). We'll adjust the code to correctly handle this sequence. **Here's a revised snippet that should help:** \`\`\`java private static void processInput(String line, Scanner scanner, PrintWriter writer) { // Extract problem number safely String problemLine = line.trim(); // Assuming line is \\"Problem X\\" String[] parts = problemLine.split(\\" \\"); int problemNumber; try { problemNumber = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); // Assuming \\"Problem X\\" } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Error parsing problem number from line: \\" + problemLine); return; // Skip this problem due to parsing error } // Assuming the next line is to be ignored, indicating matrix start scanner.nextLine(); // Skipping a line, ideally containing \\"Amatrix:\\" or similar header // The matrix size is expected to be on the next line if (!scanner.hasNextInt()) { System.err.println(\\"Expected matrix size not found after \\" + line); return; // Skip this problem due to unexpected format } int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Reading the actual size // Initialize distance and path matrices with appropriate values int[][] dist = new int[n][n]; int[][] P = new int[n][n]; // Read n x n matrix values for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { dist[i][j] = scanner.nextInt(); // Fill the distance matrix; assumes data availability P[i][j] = 0; // Initialization implying no intermediate vertex yet } } // Proceed with Floyd-Warshall algorithm... // The rest of your Floyd-Warshall algorithm and output formatting code remains unchanged } \`\`\` With these adjustments, your \`processInput\` method is more robust and correctly handles the expected input structure based on your descriptions. It assumes that: 1. Each \\"Problem\\" line is immediately followed by the problem number. 2. Some text (like \\"Amatrix:\\" or similar) follows that line, which the program skips. 3. After skipping that line, the next line should contain the matrix size (\`n\`), ensuring that the sequence of operations aligns with the expected file format. This method enhancement adds better error handling and clarification to the parsing sequence, addressing the immediate cause of your \`NumberFormatException\` by not attempting to parse non-numeric lines as integers."},{"instruction":"import java.io.*; import java.util.Scanner; public class floyd { private static final int INF = (int) 1e9; // Assuming this might be used for initialization public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length != 1) { System.err.println(\\"Usage: java floyd <input_file_path>\\"); return; } String filePath = args[0]; try { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filePath)); PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\\"output.txt\\"); while (scanner.hasNextLine()) { String line = scanner.nextLine(); if (line.contains(\\"Problem\\")) { processInput(line, scanner, writer); } } scanner.close(); writer.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { System.err.println(\\"File not found: \\" + e.getMessage()); } } private static void processInput(String line, Scanner scanner, PrintWriter writer) { // Extract problem number safely String problemLine = line.trim(); // Assuming line is “Problem X” String[] parts = problemLine.split(\\" \\"); int problemNumber; try { problemNumber = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); // Assuming “Problem X” } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Error parsing problem number from line: \\" + problemLine); return; // Skip this problem due to parsing error } // Assuming the next line is to be ignored, indicating matrix start scanner.nextLine(); // Skipping a line, ideally containing “Amatrix:” or similar header // The matrix size is expected to be on the next line if (!scanner.hasNextInt()) { System.err.println(\\"Expected matrix size not found after \\" + line); return; // Skip this problem due to unexpected format } int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Reading the actual size // Initialize distance and path matrices with appropriate values int[][] dist = new int[n][n]; int[][] P = new int[n][n]; // Read n x n matrix values for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { dist[i][j] = scanner.nextInt(); // Fill the distance matrix; assumes data availability P[i][j] = 0; // Initialization implying no intermediate vertex yet } } for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) { for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) { if(dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) { dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]; P[i][j] = k+1; // Store intermediate vertex } } } } writer.printf(\\"Problem %d: n = %dn\\", problemNumber, n); writer.println(\\"Pmatrix:\\"); for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) { writer.print(P[i][j] + \\" \\"); } writer.println(); } for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { writer.printf(\\"V%d-Vj: shortest path and lengthn\\", i+1); for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) { displayPath(i, j, P, writer, \\"\\"); writer.printf(\\": %dn\\", dist[i][j]); } } writer.println(); } private static void displayPath(int i, int j, int[][] P, PrintWriter writer, String path) { if(P[i][j] == 0) { if(!path.contains(\\"V\\" + (j+1))) { writer.print(path + \\"V\\" + (j+1) + \\" \\"); } return; } displayPath(i, P[i][j]-1, P, writer, path); displayPath(P[i][j]-1, j, P, writer, path); } } java floyd graphfile.txt Error parsing problem number from line: Problem1 Amatrix: n = 7 Error parsing problem number from line: Problem2 Amatrix: n = 6 Input is Problem1 Amatrix: n = 7 0 6 5 4 6 3 6 6 0 6 4 5 5 3 5 6 0 3 1 4 6 4 4 3 0 4 1 4 6 5 1 4 0 5 5 3 5 4 1 5 0 3 6 3 6 4 5 3 0 Problem2 Amatrix: n = 6 0 1 2 1 3 4 1 0 3 2 2 3 2 3 0 3 3 6 1 2 3 0 3 5 3 2 3 3 0 5 4 3 6 5 5 0","output":"The error you're encountering indicates an issue with extracting the problem number due to an incorrect assumption about the structure of the input line.

It was a far-right imperialist power infamous for its rampant state- and corporate-sponsored bigotry and its ruthless principles of Social Darwinism. Its ruling powers believed that humans were a superior race and that all other sentient civilizations were \\"backwards\\" and \\"primitive\\". It conquered numerous exoplanets and subjected any native inhabitants to apartheid and discrimination. Eventually, rebels from one of its colony worlds, Uingffh, overthrew the empire in 2102. In addition to its speciesism, Kalgamania was also known to discriminate against minorities within the human race as well. The upper classes were predominantly white or white-passing cisgender, neurotypical men. Church and state were not separate and prosecution of other religious faiths as well as members of the LGBTQ+ community was common, with bible verses such as Leviticus 18:22 being used to justify these acts. Neurodivergent people such as autistics and those with ADHD were also looked down upon, with many of Kalgamania's social norms directly going against common neurodivergent traits. Kalgamania's capital was Leviticus City, which despite the country's European roots is located in what was once the Bay Area region of what used to be the U.S. state of California. It was notable for containing an immense three kilometer-long ring-shaped palace which served as the home of the empire's royal family. ~~History ~Pre-interstellar era and Kalgamanian Revolution (2030-2040) Before Kalgamania had been established, humanity was in disarray due to numerous natural calamities like climate change and a group of extremely powerful hurricanes in 2027 including one that severely affected the global climate and destroyed large portions of the North American Continent. With many nations collapsing or on the verge of doing so, conditions were ripe for an extremist government to take power, as many citizens started blaming moderate ideologies like liberalism and conservatism for the state of the Earth and began looking towards more radical ideologies. This was enhanced by the fact that Generation Z, which was known for being predominantly far-left, was now old enough to begin taking positions of power. Eventually, a group of seven English politicians began promoting an ideology they called Kalgamania in 2028. In stark contrast to the overall leftist political atmosphere of the Earth at the time, Kalgamania was very far right and blamed minority groups such as people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women who did not abide by traditonal gender norms, etc. for the chaos. Through use of unusually powerful arms as well as a massive propaganda campaign, Kalgamania was able to become the dominant party on Earth and was eventually founded as a nation on December 26, 2030. However, this was not without the deaths of nearly a billion people in the process. The politicians who had formed the nation seated themselves as Kalgamania's royal family and turned the nation into an absolute monarchy. The process of Kalgamania rising to power would become known as the Kalgamanian Revolution. The unusual power of Kalgamania's technology has driven conspiracy theories that the founders were being assisted by aliens or were performing supernatural rituals, but the government has repeatedly driven down these statements with the simple notion that their technological advancements were because of \\"the everlasting greatness of the human race.\\" The flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carried some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. ~Peaceful interstellar era (2040-2084) After the empire was founded, the royal family pushed for rapid technological development in order to recover from the ruin caused by the natural disasters. To this end, the Kalgamanian royal family decided to decrease their influence slightly and breed free-market capitalism with the promise that successful businessmen would become nobles of the empire and be granted special privileges. This effort turned out to be successful, with humanity becoming capable of commercial interplanetary travel by 2035 and with many colonies being set up on Mars, the Moon, and moons of the outer giant planets. However, classism became rampant as a side effect of this, adding on to the already severe bigotry towards other minorities. To quell rebellions, Kalgamania developed its already powerful military and used it against dissent. By 2040, Kalgamania had discovered a wormhole in the outer fringes of the solar system that led to the star system of Gliese 105. Humanity sent a ship named the Voyager III into the wormhole and discovered numerous alien races in the system (which they called Ingffhaestia), including those of Uingffh. Despite Kalgamania's xenophobic tendencies, they were friendly towards the aliens and even established a colony on Uingffh called Neo Gaia in 2050. Ingffhaestia and Kalgamania lived in relative peace as the two shared information about their biology and cultures. However, tensions arose in 2075 when the two began learning more about their respective political ideologies. Ingffhaestia did not condone Kalgamania's acts of discrimination and its capitalist system while Kalgamania became opposed to Ingffhaestia due to Ingffhaestia being socialist, which went directly against Kalgamania's principles. This would soon escalate into outright war in 2084. ~Colonial interstellar era (2085-2098) [An illustration of Rinelia su Kalgamania, the empress of Kalgamania at the time Kalgamania invaded Ingffhaestia. Its illustrator was later executed upon coming out as bisexual.] In 2085, Kalgamania, with its highly advanced technology born out of worker abuse and slave labor, easily won the war against Ingffhaestia in 2085, subsequently placing every planet in Ingffhaestia under its control. Kalgamania transitioned into a colonial power similar to European nations during the 1800's and 1900's and began extending its discriminatory policies towards Ingffhaestian species with the justification that humans were genetically superior and Ingffhaestian aliens inferior. Ingffhaestians were barred from participating in Kalgamanian society and were either sent to concentration camps for experimentation, were forced to work in unhealthy conditions 24/7 for one of the empire's many private businesses, or were simply executed. Entire families were separated and children as young as newborns were murdered. Propaganda was set up that portrayed member species of the now-fallen Ingffhaestian Federation as evil and blasphemous while history classes were forced to give biased information pertaining to why non-humans were not to be trusted. Invasive earth species were introduced to many worlds that led to the extinction of millions of native alien life. Nationalism also became rampant, with Kalgamanian flags being held up in almost every public place and schools being forced to give patriotic education. After Ingffhaestia was conquered, Kalgamania began invading numerous other star systems after inventing wormhole-generating devices. A total of eleven other solar systems became colonized by the empire, which were each represented by an added star to the Kalgamanian flag. Any native species inhabiting these systems were subjected to the same discriminatory practices used on the Ingffhaestians. Humanity even invented weapons called world glassers which had the ability to burn the surface of whole continents and were used to put down any opposition against the royal family or the noble corporations. ~~Government Earth-Kalgamania is an absolute monarchy composed of a royal family which wields almost absolute power over their empire. Royals have the ability to execute people, pass laws, etc. at ease with very little restrictions. Ordinary citizens have little say in their government's affairs. The head of the family is a single emperor or empress whose power trumps even other royal family members. Emperors stay in power until they die or they voluntarily resign, though resignation is highly looked down upon and is seen as a sign of weakness. The royal family is divided up into seven houses representing each of the seven founders of Kalgamania. In order from most powerful to least powerful, they are the Houses of Su, Inv, Ir, Ace, Av, Gul, and Lux. Royal family members have his/her (the use of him or her rather than them is intentional, as non-binary people were forbidden to have positions of power in the empire and any royal family member found out to be non-binary was executed) house name as their middle name and \\"Kalgamania\\" as his/her last name. For example, Rinelia su Kalgamania is a member of the House of Su and thus carries the middle name of su. All middle names are in lowercase. In addition to the royal family, wealthy businessmen also have considerable political power. Many of them are nobles appointed by the emperor, and advertisements for their respective companies are just as common and widespread as government propaganda. However, the royal family still carries more political power than businessmen and has the ability to restrict their influence at will, especially if their ideas go against that of Kalgamania. Every colony planet/moon has one governor-general assigned to it who rules over the world on behalf of the emperor's. Governor-generals can only be appointed by the emperor him/herself and are usually members of the royal family, though some governor-generals are prominent businessmen with no genetic ties to the royal bloodline. ~Order of succession When an emperor dies or resigns, the person who will be the next emperor is determined by age and house. The next person in line to become emperor of Kalgamania is usually the oldest person in the House of Su. If all members of the House of Su are deceased or exiled, then the oldest member of the House of Inv will become emperor in accordance to the order of most powerful royal houses, followed by the next oldest in Inv. If all members of the House of Inv are also dead, then the oldest in the House of Ir will become emperor and so on. In the rare case that every member of the royal family is killed, a nobleman will be selected at random to become emperor. At least one member of the House of Su was alive throughout the entirety of Kalgamania's history, so none of these measures have ever been taken. Anyone who is crowned emperor automatically gains \\"su\\" as a middle name and becomes new head of the House of Su regardless of whether or not he/she was part of the House of Su beforehand. ~List of Rulers Over Kalgamania's 72-year history, the empire saw a total of three emperors. All three were part of the same bloodline and are listed below. List of Kalgamanian emperors Name|Period of Rule|Notes Nathan su Kalgamania|December 26, 2030 - November 11, 2052|Founder of Kalgamania Odysseus su Kalgamania|November 14, 2052 - October 8, 2084|Died from assassination; likely culprit is Rinelia Rinelia su Kalgamania|October 20, 2084 - September 20, 2102|First female ruler; took power after the death of her father Odysseus (which was likely her doing) ~~Economy Despite the controlling and totalitarianist nature of Kalgamania, the empire's economy is primarily capitalist. Private individuals control most means of production and are allowed to build companies with very little restrictions, with the only justification for restricting a company's rights being if they express direct opposition towards the royal family. Workers' rights are disregarded and entrepreneurs are allowed to pay their employees as little as they like, set as many work hours as they like, and even execute workers. Businessmen carry a large amount of influence on Kalgamanian politics and culture and carry similar privileges to royal family members. Advertisements for their companies are widespread and are just as, if not more common than government propaganda. Particularly successful entrepreneurs are often granted noble status by the emperor. As a result of this capitalist economy, Kalgamania is highly advanced technologically, but everyday citizens live largely in poverty. Communism and its flaws are often used as fear tactics by both the royal family and companies to keep the general population loyal to Kalgamania despite their poor living conditions. Helping the poor is looked at with disdain and poverty is seen as simply the result of failure on the poor's part - an extension of the overall Social Darwinist nature of the empire. ~~Culture Kalgamanian culture has a large emphasis on tradition. Many aspects of European culture, such as the use of English as the dominant language, pounds being used as currency, etc. are found in Kalgamania. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire, but only in their traditional European forms (e.g. baroque and classical music, realistic art, and classical literature). Cultural works from the modern era (cartoon/anime art, modern literature, rap/pop music, etc.) and from other cultures are looked down upon, though there are some cases of them being successful. Despite this, Kalgamania has highly advanced technology which is celebrated by both the general populace and the nobility/royalty. Social norms, keeping order, survival of the fittest (Social Darwinism), and an aversion to things perceived as abnormal play a large role in Kalgamanian society and are largely tied in with its traditional values. This unfortunately also means that discrimination against minorities is widespread, with bigotry having a powerful influence on Kalgamanian society. Derogatory slurs such as nigger, faggot, dyke, retard, etc. are are often thrown around by both the youth and even mature adults. ~Sexism Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Kalgamania. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Kalgamanian law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Kalgamanian society and was banned in the empire. Despite these social norms, several women existed who carry high positions in Kalgamanian society, though they were mostly royalty and still discriminated against other minority groups. The last emperor/empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania was female: Rinelia su Kalgamania. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. ~Ableism Extroversion, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, introversion, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as \\"unusual\\" hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Kalgamania contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. \`Homophobia Homophobia was commonplace in Kalgamania due to the empire's Christian roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Kalgamania's version of Christianity. Same-gender relationships were illegal and gay people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. Businessmen were allowed to fire workers on the basis of their sexuality. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Kalgamanian law. Gay couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. The words gay and homosexual were often used as insults. ~Biphobia Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Kalgamanian society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like gay people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. ~Aphobia Asexual and aromantic people were targeted by the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania in addition to bisexuals and homosexuals. Because it was considered Kalgamanians' duty to have a partner and raise a family, those who did not experience sexual or romantic attraction were looked down upon and treated in similar ways to bisexuals and homosexuals. Many asexuals and aromantics were forced to have sex or enter unwanted romantic relationships, which was worsened by the fact that sexual assault was fully condoned by the empire. ~Transphobia Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community: with oppression. Kalgamania saw gender and sex as one and the same; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Kalgamanian youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. ~Racism Continuing with the Social Darwinist trend of the empire, white Kalgamanians saw themselves as superior to people of color. Lynching and beating of people of color were commonplace and Black, Asian, etc. culture was suppressed. Having hairstyles indicative of people of color, like afros and dreadlocks, was punishable by indefinite imprisonment until the offender chooses to cut his/her hair to something more acceptable by Kalgamanian standards. Racial stereotypes were frequently seen in Kalgamanian media such as exaggeratedly narrow eyes in Asian characters and the notion of Black people liking watermelons. Non-European cultures were highly stereotyped and misrepresented. ~Religious discrimination People who preached faiths other than Christianity were fiercely condemned by Earth-Kalgamania. Jews, muslims, etc. were often incarcerated by the state or businesses and were tortured in order to get them to convert to Christianity. Corporations did not give accommodations to people who needed to observe religious holidays and traditions for important times of the year like Hanukkah and Ramadan were disrespected and ignored. Even atheists were subject to prejudice by the holy empire and were pressured by peers, the government, etc. to become Christian. -Antisemitism Kalgamanians were allowed to freely display Nazi symbols and other anti-Jewish symbols. Jewish stereotypes were rampant in the media and antisemitic ideas were woven into education. The construction of synagogues was forbidden by Kalgamanian law and any synagogue built was to be demolished and its builders executed. -Islamophobia People were forbidden to wear hijabs both in public and in private. Schools and media taught children that muslims were anti-Kalgamania terrorists and not to be trusted. Like with Jews and other religious minorities, muslims were frequently blamed for any misfortune that occurs in the Holy Kalgamanian Empire. ~Ageism Though not directly present in Kalgamanian laws, discrimination against both the elderly and the young was common. Elderly people whose old age inhibited their supposed usefulness in Kalgamanian society were murdered by hospitals similarly to disabled people. Young people were painted as selfish, naive, and unfit to have a say in important issues even if they show consistently mature behavior. ~Classism Due to the Earth-Kalgamanian Empire being a highly capitalist and consumerist country, classism was common. Poverty was widespread in Kalgamanian colonies and the lower social classes lived in conditions comparable to those other minorities lived in. Kalgamanians are taught that poverty is the fault of the poor themselves despite the fact that businessmen hoarding money and abusing workers was the main cause of poverty. ~Speciesism Speciesism was one of the most prominent forms of bigotry influencing Kalgamanian culture. New slurs made out of the names of alien species were frequent. For example, members of the tabulon race, the native species of Uingffh and Urlum/the Seraph's species, were referred to by the derogatory word tabbie. Species also experienced derogatory comparisons to fictional alien species in Earth pop culture such as the Wookies from Star Wars, the Vulcans from Star Trek, and the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar. Much like with the poor, people are taught that the cruel treatment of aliens is justified by the notion that the humans won fairly and that they are free to do what they want with those they defeated. Schools were also forced to teach that aliens were inherently evil and dangerous. Most media featuring aliens portrayed the aliens in a negative and heavily stereotyped manner. Many propaganda posters depict aliens doing traditionally immoral deeds, sometimes with a conventionally attractive human doing good deeds for comparison. ~Nationalism Nationalism and patriotism have a large influence over culture in the empire. Kalgamanian children are taught to display their utmost loyalty to their nation. Even their birth certificates contain a Kalgamanian flag and the motto of \\"All hail the Earth!\\" on their corners. Kalgamanian flags can often be seen on city streets and it is national law to display a Kalgamanian flag in front of every household. Propaganda against aliens is commonplace. All classes are forced to recite the following pledge while facing the flag before resuming normal learning activities: *\\"I pledge my loyalty, my strength, and my wisdom to the Emperor, to Earth, to humanity, and to God. And to our almighty fatherland - the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania, a perfect nation, blessed by the Lord, undefeatable, which shall spread order and stability across the universe. All hail Kalgamania! All hail the Earth! All hail humanity!”* All classes are from a patriotic viewpoint and contain anti-alien propaganda weaved into their lessons. The Kalgamanian military is glorified and many films about its victories exist. Furthermore, television channels frequently broadcast advertisements encouraging or even guilt-tripping citizens into joining the armed forces. ~Individualism and Social Darwinism [An old political comic originally created before Kalgamania rose which is now used frequently by the empire. Original source unknown.] Despite the controlling nature of Earth-Kalgamania's ruling powers, individualism is a strongly valued concept in the country. However, it has been twisted in a way that breeds entitlement and toxicity as opposed to genuine freedom. Individualism only exists for privileged groups (white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, male, human, etc.) and freedom is used as a justification for bigoted beliefs. The belief of Social Darwinism is perpetuated in the empire and life is seen as survival of the fittest. Victim blaming is very common and people who do immoral acts towards others are given leeway in the Kalgamanian judicial system unless their acts go against Kalgamanian philosophy. People undergoing struggle are told to simply get over their issues regardless of whether doing so is actually feasible or not. Asking for help from others is looked down upon as a sign of weakness. This sense of individualism often influences Kalgamanian bigotry such as transgender people being told to just accept the bodies they were born in, the poor being blamed for their own poverty, toxic masculinity, rape culture, etc. ~National Flower [Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii is the national flower of the Kalgamanian Empire.] The national flower of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania is Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii, a breed of Agapanthus praecox. The plant is known for its long stalks containing large umbels of small bell-shaped flowers whose purple color is likened to that of the Kalgamanian flag, which is why it was named the national flower of the Empire. Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii can be found in numerous places such as in front of businesses, in parking lots, and more in Leviticus City and other Mediterranean climates due to the plant being fit for warm areas. They are also known to be popular garden plants, as they do not require much maintenance. However, they are considered a nuisance to citizens of the Empire (particularly amongst the lower social classes) due to the agapanthuses invading local ecosystems as well as because their strong roots often damage concrete. They are infamous among aliens as being representative of the destruction of their homeworlds' ecosystems due the fact that thousands of square kilometers of alien wildlife were harmed by invasive Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii specimens. By 2103, Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii was banned from existing on alien planets and all plants of the breed were seen as weeds and pulled, though they continue to exist in large numbers on Earth. ~~Religion Kalgamania's dominant religion is Christianity, which is reflected in the references to God in the Kalgamanian pledge. Christianity is weaved into many of the policies and laws of the empire and separation of church and state is nonexistent, which is seen in how Earth-Kalgamania is referred to as a 'holy' empire. The Bible is often used as a justification for Kalgamania's strict policies of discrimination; for example, its law of forbidding same-sex relationships uses Leviticus 18:22 (\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\\") as its justification. People of other faiths or who are atheist are encouraged to convert to Christianity. The pope and other high-ranking members of the Christian Church carry power comparable to that of businessmen and royalty. Kalgamanians celebrate Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though like in the real world, they have largely been turned into tools used by entrepreneurs to increase sales. ~\`Military Kalgamania's military is known as the Holy Kalgamanian Armed Forces (HKAF). They are among one of the most powerful militaries and carry numerous pieces of advanced technology. Their soldier numbers amount in the billions and they own millions of tanks, guns, planes, and spaceships. Laser technology is heavily utilized by Kalgamania in its military endeavors. ~World glassers One of the most infamous and feared weapons of the HKAF is the world glasser, a kilometer-long spaceship with the ability to soil entire landmasses by concentrating nuclear charges in a fashion similar to the Casaba-Howitzer Project. Though the Juprits-class world glasser is the main type of world glasser, other world glasser variants exist, albeit they are used sparingly and rarely. A total of ten world glasser types, including the Juprits, were built by Kalgamania. [The Juprits-Class World Glasser. 1.9 kilometers long, it was the standard model of world glasser used by Kalgamania. It had two cannons which could fire lasers with the ability to destroy a city.] [The Juperius-Class World Glasser was a slight improvement on the Juprits' design, being 2.5 kilometers long and bearing four cannons instead of two.] [The Courageous-Class Heavy World Glasser was another heavy world glasser. Being 6 km long, it carried only two world-glassing cannons, but they were both more powerful than that of the Trident and could create explosions the size of Texas.] [The Trident-Class Heavy World Glasser was the first in a line of three larger world glasser classes called heavy world glassers. 4 km long, the Trident was actually two ships attached to each other. The Trident carried four cannons, two for each ship, which can each destroy an area the size of a small country or U.S. state.] [The Privilege-Class was the first of a line of even larger world glassers called Super World Glassers. It was 8 km long and carried eight cannons whose lasers can destroy large countries or even landmasses.] [The Catalyst-Class, a variation of the Courageous. The Catalyst lacks the large spar and underside structures on the bottom of a normal Courageous, making it much more agile in combat.] [The Oppressor-Class Super World Glasser was an even larger super world glasser that was 10 km long. It carried 12 cannons compared to the Privilege's measly eight. Its two towers on the top could fire potent lasers of their own which could eliminate enemy ships with ease in addition to the ship's numerous other guns.] [The Absolute-Class Super World Glasser was the largest of the super world glassers, being 12.5 km in length. This ship class carried two towers on top which had the ability to let out pulses. These pulses could temporarily disable enemy ships, ensuring an easy victory.] [The Empyrean-Class was the largest and most powerful world glasser in the whole HKAF, being described as a hyper world glasser. The Empyrean was 15 km long and has the ability to decimate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it uninhabitable for centuries. Only one Empyrean was built, and it was used as the flagship of Rinelia.] [The Heartless-Class Super World Glasser was a reactionary redesign of the super world glasser when it was found that the city-like structures at the top of super world glassers could be used by fighter planes as cover. The Heartless solves this issue by having its cityscape covered, depriving fighters of the ability to hide in them. The Heartless was 10 km long and contained a single but powerful cannon.] ~Gliese Indigenous Police One of the most well-known parts of the military was the Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP), a police force stationed in Gliese 105. Though its purpose was as a general police force for helping the populace, its main task was oppressing native alien races and keeping their power in check. Video footage of the GIP brutally beating or even murdering natives exists online. One particular beating, the murder of tabulon Catalystia Floraze through chokehold, gained widespread media attention and began a social movement known as Tabulon Lives Matter (TLM), which was later expanded to Protect Indigenous Aliens (PIA) as more and more Kalgamanian citizens realized the flaws of their government. Both of these movements paved the way for the Seraphim Rebellion. ~~Demographics Though the term \\"Kalgamanian\\" technically refers to any human loyal to Kalgamania, it is usually only used to the 99.2% of the human population that is of European descent. Only 0.8% of all Kalgamanian citizens are people of color due to ethnic cleansing and racism. ~~Geographics Though beginning in Europe, Kalgamnia's territory quickly expanded to include all of Earth's land area after conquering all other countries in existence. At its peak, the empire also controlled the entire Solar System along with twelve other star systems all within 50 light-years of Earth. All of these territories except Earth were later lost when the Seraph rebelled and dismantled Earth-Kalgamania in 2102. ~List of colonies * = habitable world >Solar System >>Mercury >>Venus >>Earth* (Capital of the Empire) >>Mars >>Jupiter >>Saturn >>Uranus >>Neptune >Alpha Centauri A System >>Alva >>Blalo* >>Orus >Alpha Centauri B System >>Kaith >>Cale >>Syro >Proxima Centauri >>Iro >>Narath* >>Sian >>Ernus >Cervantes (Mu Arae) System >>Dulcinea >>Rocinante >>>Paleo* >>Quijote >>>Neo* >>Sancho >Ran (Epsilon Eridani) System >>Odin >>Thoriam >>>Epaphus* >>Aegir >>Tias >Apollo (HD 219134) System >>Hephaestus >>Aphrodite >>Nereus >>Aura >>Penthesileia >>Ares* >>Cardea >>>Dionysus* >>Aeolus >>>Achlys* >Tabaldak (Epsilon Indi) System >>Dzeedzeebonda* >>Gluskab* >>Bmda >>Chibaiskweda >>Azeban/Tsinoo (Binary Planet) >Chawalan (47 Ursae Majoris) System >>Phi Phong >>Pret >>Nang Tan* >>Taphao Thong >>>Kuman Thong* >>Taphao Khew >>Phosop >TRAPPIST-1 System >>Holland >>Helsbergen >>Hennendal >>Alicanto >>Payachata* >>Llorona* >>Tirana >Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) System >>Firades >>Lavaria >>Shoji >>Coppelius >>>Uingffh* >>Saringffh* >>Ibiridius* >>>Muulforia* >>>Yangteon* >>>Cornelia* >>>Gabolar* >>Azure >>Fillonia >>Halmonia >>Golmia >>Hege >>Xong >>Ajooni >>Digrazia >Avimotalis System >>Onaut >>Narva >>Exicle >>Bor* >>Kitanis >>>Lelantos* >>>Durus* >>>Nides >>Pronos >>Sriaturn >Heranis System >>Lurmes >>Ilsadite >>Sahariana* >>Rasaidor* >>Florazia* >>Olympia* >>Pluma >>Augustus >>Ardollo >>Jasper >>Transolia ~~Flag As mentioned previously, the flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carries some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. The twelve stars on the diagonal stripes represent each of the twelve star systems conquered by the empire. |-Rinelia su Kalgamania Rinelia su Kalgamania 3rd Empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania In office: October 20, 2084 - December 26, 2099 Predecessor: Odysseus su Kalgamania (father) Successor: N/A (last empress; Kalgamania dissolved following end of rule) Personal Information Partner: None Children: None Father: Odysseus su Kalgamania (2nd Emperor of Kalgamania) Mother: Penelope su Kalgamania Born: December 26, 2074, Leviticus City Died: December 26, 2099 (age 25), Leviticus City Religion: Catholicism Rinelia su Kalgamania (December 26, 2074 - December 26, 2099) was the third and final empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania (LVL's Urlum the Usurper) as well as Kalgamania's first female ruler. Taking the throne at a record young age of 9 following the murder of her parents and former rulers Odysseus and Penelope (allegedly at her own hands) su Kalgamania, Rinelia ruled the Holy Kalgamanian Empire from 2084 to 2099, when she was ousted from power by Urlum Eudae Kaywell during the Seraphim Rebellion of 2099. Rinelia was responsible for the conquest of the Ingffhaestian System and the transformation of Kalgamania into an interstellar power. As empress, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and was infamous for conducting oppressive policies towards minority groups including people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, political dissidents, etc. She was also a devout Catholic and took part in the religious persecution of countless religious minorities. However, her most notable act was the invasion of the Ingffhaestian Federation a year after she began her rule; during and after the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Rinelia closely involved herself in the brutal subjugation and oppression of Ingffhaestia's various alien races, whom she and her human subjects viewed as genetically inferior to them. She reportedly died on December 26, 2099 after being executed by the Seraph, leader of the Seraphim Rebellion which rose to oppose her rule. ~~Early Life Rinelia su Kalgamania was born the daughter of Emperor Odysseus su Kalgamania and his wife Penelope on December 26, 2074 along with her twin brother Lenelius su Kalgamania. Though not much is known about Rinelia's childhood due to censorship, most sources agree that Rinelia and Lenelius had a somewhat mischievous, but overall close and loving relationship and that she lived a luxurious, extravagant lifestyle in the palace. It is also known that as a child, she consumed large amounts of fictional works containing anti-Ingffhaestia rhetoric including literature; her parents looked down upon other children Rinelia's age who used modern technology such as cell phones or television, raising her in a very traditional and authoritative manner. Initially, Rinelia's older brother Telemachus su Kalgamania was the next in-line for the throne. However, anti-Kalgamanian rebels staged a bombing which killed Telemachus in 2082, resulting in heated disputes over whether Rinelia or her brother would ascend to the throne. On October 20, 2084, all members of the House of Su except Rinelia were found dead in the Leviticus City Imperial Palace, leaving Rinelia as the sole candidate for ruler. She was crowned that day as Third Empress of Kalgamania at the age of 9 years old, the youngest on record. Though unconfirmed, many historians now agree that Rinelia had executed her family herself in order to become Empress. ~~Empress As Empress, Rinelia's rule was aided by a council of royal advisors due to her young age. However, the Empress frequently bribed or threatened her advisors in order to get her ways. Following her father as well as her grandfather Nathan su Kalgamania's footsteps, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and executed all who opposed her rule. ~Ingffhestia-Kalgamania War Vehemently opposing the Ingffhaestian Federation even during childhood, Rinelia's first move as Empress was to declare war on Ingffhaestia on October 31, 2084. The Empress ordered weapon manufacturing companies to significantly increase production of spaceships and space weapons for the war by forcing employees to work 24 hours as part of her Interstellar Militarization Act (IMA). This led to several strikes and protests among workers viewing their employers' policies as exploitative; Rinelia quickly put these revolts down by force while denouncing the worker protests as \\"degeneracy on the level of those Ingffhaestian retards.\\" A total of 17,329 workers died as a result of armed enforcement of the IMA. ~~CONTENT BELOW YET TO BE REVAMPED With military production bolstered by the exploitation of workers, Kalgamania was able to procure thousands of state-of-the-art spacecraft and weaponry, including the infamous world glasser, which Rinelia immediately sent into service in the war against Ingffhaestia. They quickly overpowered the Ingffhaestian Federation's forces. On January 16, 2085, the Ingffhaestian Federation surrendered to Kalgamanian rule after its capital, the city of Yang-Moof on Planet Uingffh, was threatened to be destroyed by a shot from a world glasser. The Empress made a public statement that day blaming the Ingffhaestians' loss on their supposed genetic inferiority, proclaiming humans as a superior race. She also blamed the Ingffhaestians' emphasis on peace, stating that \\"peace is the catalyst of weakness\\" and that \\"the greatest strength comes from the greatest wars.\\" ~Colonization of Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) Following the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Empress Rinelia appointed several noblemen, business leaders, and family members as governor-generals to rule the newly-conquered planets on her behalf. Over roughly a decade, Rinelia oversaw numerous programs of oppression designed to eliminate alien civilizations and their culture as well as the development of human settlements on the colonized worlds. She also had ships colonize other star systems such as Epsilon Indi, Alpha Centauri, etc., though no programs of oppression were created for these systems due to their lack of native civilizations. On June 4, 2086, Rinelia su Kalgamania announced the formation of the **Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP)**, an organization designed to \\"bring order and civility\\" to non-human species. Under Rinelia's orders, the GIP rounded up hundreds of thousands of aliens and imprisoned, tortured, or even murdered them. Oftentimes, they would murder or capture aliens in broad daylight in public; Rinelia and the GIP would cover-up these incidents by concocting false stories of the aliens in question threatening to incide violence against humans. This not only deflected criticisms of Rinelia's programs of oppression, but also contributed to the Empress' speciesist propaganda campaign. Back on Earth, Rinelia built a lavish lifestyle for herself, hiring thousands of servants including many alien slaves. She had a new, much larger imperial palace, the Tower of Babel, built for her. Like the previous emperors, Empress Rinelia treated her servants with extreme, wanton cruelty; she would have butlers and maids tortured or executed for minor offenses such as breaking furniture, getting recipes wrong, creating stains on her dress, etc. She also imposed outrageous tasks and restrictions on the royal staff; Rinelia would force her cooks to create huge meals, her gardeners to tend to large swaths of her personal garden (the Court of Thorns and Roses, nicknamed the Court of Death and Destruction by servants due to the high number of executions carried out there), and other servants to complete long, arduous chores over an unrealistically short period of time, executing anyone who failed to meet these impossible goals. The Empress limited the servants' pay as well, with most receiving as little as 1 cent an hour. Rinelia frequently practiced favoritism in paying her servants, with the Empress granting more money to servants she favored and cutting the pay of servants she disliked or held no particular care for. Alien slaves enlisted as servants in Rinelia's palace received no pay.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide assistance with that request."},{"instruction":"Assign Rinelia with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Based on the detailed characteristics of Rinelia su Kalgamania as described in the provided narrative, one can speculate the following psychological profiles and categorizations. However, it's essential to note that these are hypothetical assessments and applying real psychological models to fictional characters must be done cautiously and for entertainment or analytical purposes rather than taking them as true psychological evaluations. # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) Rinelia could be classified as an **ESTJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)**. This MBTI type is often seen in individuals who are decisive, authoritative, and uphold traditional values. They tend to be highly structured and invest themselves in maintaining social order, aligning well with Rinelia's role as an empress enforcing strict dominance and control. # Enneagram Rinelia might align with **Type 8 (The Challenger)**. Type 8s are characterized by their need to be self-reliant, to prove their strength and resist being controlled, which mirrors Rinelia's imperialistic and oppressive behaviors as well as her desire for power and control over others. # Temperament Given her characteristics, **Choleric** temperament suits her. This temperament is marked by ambition, energy, and a tendency to be task-oriented but can also tend towards aggression and dominance, fitting Rinelia’s leadership and brutal governance style. # Big Five Personality Traits - **Extraversion: High:** Rinelia's commanding presence and her ability to assert dominance and lead an empire suggest high extraversion. - **Neuroticism: High:** The extreme measures Rinelia takes against perceived threats and failures imply a high level of emotional reactivity and possibly instability. - **Conscientiousness: High:** Her focus on control, structure, and expansion show a strong sense of duty and organizational skills. - **Agreeableness: Low:** The ruthless means by which she maintains power and discriminates against minorities signify low compassion and cooperation. - **Openness: Low:** Rinelia's preference for traditional values and resistance to change or diversity indicates low openness to experience. # Socionics Given her traits, Rinelia might be classified as **LSE (Logical Sensory Extrovert)** in Socionics, also known as **ESTj**, which highlights efficiency, practicality, and the implementation of structured systems, all traits that she embodies in her governance. # Instinctual Variant **So/Sx (Social/Sexual)** could be suitable due to her focus on maintaining power, control, and her image within the empire, paired with an intense focus on personal relationships, as seen in her manipulation and treatment of those close to her or under her control. # Hogwarts House Rinelia's ambition, cunning, use of any means to achieve her ends, and emphasis on purity and heritage align her most closely with **Slytherin**. # Moral Alignment Her actions and the described governance model suggest a **Lawful Evil** alignment. She operates within a structured system of her own making, emphasizing control and order, but her methods are oppressive, cruel, and self-serving. Remember, these assessments are speculative and intended for entertainment purposes rather than accurate psychological analysis."},{"instruction":"|-Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania MOTTO: \\"All Hail the Earth!\\" CAPITAL: Leviticus City (formerly San Francisco) LARGEST CITY: Exodus (formerly London) AREA: 13 star systems POPULATION: 190 billion RELIGION; Christianity OFFICIAL LANGUAGES: English DEMONYM: Kalgamanian GOVERNMENT: Imperialist Absolute Monarchy LEGISLATURE: Kalgamanian Royal Family FOUNDED: December 26, 2030 GDP: 495 trillion CURRENCY: Pounds The **Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania**, also known as the **Holy Empire of Kalgamania** or just **Kalgamania**, was a global and interstellar superpower that ruled the entire Earth along with countless planets in twelve other star systems from 2030 to 2102. It was a far-right imperialist power infamous for its rampant state- and corporate-sponsored bigotry and its ruthless principles of Social Darwinism. Its ruling powers believed that humans were a superior race and that all other sentient civilizations were \\"backwards\\" and \\"primitive\\". It conquered numerous exoplanets and subjected any native inhabitants to apartheid and discrimination. Eventually, rebels from one of its colony worlds, Uingffh, overthrew the empire in 2102. In addition to its speciesism, Kalgamania was also known to discriminate against minorities within the human race as well. The upper classes were predominantly white or white-passing cisgender, neurotypical men. Church and state were not separate and prosecution of other religious faiths as well as members of the LGBTQ+ community was common, with bible verses such as Leviticus 18:22 being used to justify these acts. Neurodivergent people such as autistics and those with ADHD were also looked down upon, with many of Kalgamania's social norms directly going against common neurodivergent traits. Kalgamania's capital was Leviticus City, which despite the country's European roots is located in what was once the Bay Area region of what used to be the U.S. state of California. It was notable for containing an immense three kilometer-long ring-shaped palace which served as the home of the empire's royal family. ~~History ~Pre-interstellar era and Kalgamanian Revolution (2030-2040) Before Kalgamania had been established, humanity was in disarray due to numerous natural calamities like climate change and a group of extremely powerful hurricanes in 2027 including one that severely affected the global climate and destroyed large portions of the North American Continent. With many nations collapsing or on the verge of doing so, conditions were ripe for an extremist government to take power, as many citizens started blaming moderate ideologies like liberalism and conservatism for the state of the Earth and began looking towards more radical ideologies. This was enhanced by the fact that Generation Z, which was known for being predominantly far-left, was now old enough to begin taking positions of power. Eventually, a group of seven English politicians began promoting an ideology they called Kalgamania in 2028. In stark contrast to the overall leftist political atmosphere of the Earth at the time, Kalgamania was very far right and blamed minority groups such as people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women who did not abide by traditonal gender norms, etc. for the chaos. Through use of unusually powerful arms as well as a massive propaganda campaign, Kalgamania was able to become the dominant party on Earth and was eventually founded as a nation on December 26, 2030. However, this was not without the deaths of nearly a billion people in the process. The politicians who had formed the nation seated themselves as Kalgamania's royal family and turned the nation into an absolute monarchy. The process of Kalgamania rising to power would become known as the Kalgamanian Revolution. The unusual power of Kalgamania's technology has driven conspiracy theories that the founders were being assisted by aliens or were performing supernatural rituals, but the government has repeatedly driven down these statements with the simple notion that their technological advancements were because of \\"the everlasting greatness of the human race.\\" The flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carried some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. ~Peaceful interstellar era (2040-2084) After the empire was founded, the royal family pushed for rapid technological development in order to recover from the ruin caused by the natural disasters. To this end, the Kalgamanian royal family decided to decrease their influence slightly and breed free-market capitalism with the promise that successful businessmen would become nobles of the empire and be granted special privileges. This effort turned out to be successful, with humanity becoming capable of commercial interplanetary travel by 2035 and with many colonies being set up on Mars, the Moon, and moons of the outer giant planets. However, classism became rampant as a side effect of this, adding on to the already severe bigotry towards other minorities. To quell rebellions, Kalgamania developed its already powerful military and used it against dissent. By 2040, Kalgamania had discovered a wormhole in the outer fringes of the solar system that led to the star system of Gliese 105. Humanity sent a ship named the Voyager III into the wormhole and discovered numerous alien races in the system (which they called Ingffhaestia), including those of Uingffh. Despite Kalgamania's xenophobic tendencies, they were friendly towards the aliens and even established a colony on Uingffh called Neo Gaia in 2050. Ingffhaestia and Kalgamania lived in relative peace as the two shared information about their biology and cultures. However, tensions arose in 2075 when the two began learning more about their respective political ideologies. Ingffhaestia did not condone Kalgamania's acts of discrimination and its capitalist system while Kalgamania became opposed to Ingffhaestia due to Ingffhaestia being socialist, which went directly against Kalgamania's principles. This would soon escalate into outright war in 2084. ~Colonial interstellar era (2085-2098) [An illustration of Rinelia su Kalgamania, the empress of Kalgamania at the time Kalgamania invaded Ingffhaestia. Its illustrator was later executed upon coming out as bisexual.] In 2085, Kalgamania, with its highly advanced technology born out of worker abuse and slave labor, easily won the war against Ingffhaestia in 2085, subsequently placing every planet in Ingffhaestia under its control. Kalgamania transitioned into a colonial power similar to European nations during the 1800's and 1900's and began extending its discriminatory policies towards Ingffhaestian species with the justification that humans were genetically superior and Ingffhaestian aliens inferior. Ingffhaestians were barred from participating in Kalgamanian society and were either sent to concentration camps for experimentation, were forced to work in unhealthy conditions 24/7 for one of the empire's many private businesses, or were simply executed. Entire families were separated and children as young as newborns were murdered. Propaganda was set up that portrayed member species of the now-fallen Ingffhaestian Federation as evil and blasphemous while history classes were forced to give biased information pertaining to why non-humans were not to be trusted. Invasive earth species were introduced to many worlds that led to the extinction of millions of native alien life. Nationalism also became rampant, with Kalgamanian flags being held up in almost every public place and schools being forced to give patriotic education. After Ingffhaestia was conquered, Kalgamania began invading numerous other star systems after inventing wormhole-generating devices. A total of eleven other solar systems became colonized by the empire, which were each represented by an added star to the Kalgamanian flag. Any native species inhabiting these systems were subjected to the same discriminatory practices used on the Ingffhaestians. Humanity even invented weapons called world glassers which had the ability to burn the surface of whole continents and were used to put down any opposition against the royal family or the noble corporations. ~~Government Earth-Kalgamania is an absolute monarchy composed of a royal family which wields almost absolute power over their empire. Royals have the ability to execute people, pass laws, etc. at ease with very little restrictions. Ordinary citizens have little say in their government's affairs. The head of the family is a single emperor or empress whose power trumps even other royal family members. Emperors stay in power until they die or they voluntarily resign, though resignation is highly looked down upon and is seen as a sign of weakness. The royal family is divided up into seven houses representing each of the seven founders of Kalgamania. In order from most powerful to least powerful, they are the Houses of Su, Inv, Ir, Ace, Av, Gul, and Lux. Royal family members have his/her (the use of him or her rather than them is intentional, as non-binary people were forbidden to have positions of power in the empire and any royal family member found out to be non-binary was executed) house name as their middle name and \\"Kalgamania\\" as his/her last name. For example, Rinelia su Kalgamania is a member of the House of Su and thus carries the middle name of su. All middle names are in lowercase. In addition to the royal family, wealthy businessmen also have considerable political power. Many of them are nobles appointed by the emperor, and advertisements for their respective companies are just as common and widespread as government propaganda. However, the royal family still carries more political power than businessmen and has the ability to restrict their influence at will, especially if their ideas go against that of Kalgamania. Every colony planet/moon has one governor-general assigned to it who rules over the world on behalf of the emperor's. Governor-generals can only be appointed by the emperor him/herself and are usually members of the royal family, though some governor-generals are prominent businessmen with no genetic ties to the royal bloodline. ~Order of succession When an emperor dies or resigns, the person who will be the next emperor is determined by age and house. The next person in line to become emperor of Kalgamania is usually the oldest person in the House of Su. If all members of the House of Su are deceased or exiled, then the oldest member of the House of Inv will become emperor in accordance to the order of most powerful royal houses, followed by the next oldest in Inv. If all members of the House of Inv are also dead, then the oldest in the House of Ir will become emperor and so on. In the rare case that every member of the royal family is killed, a nobleman will be selected at random to become emperor. At least one member of the House of Su was alive throughout the entirety of Kalgamania's history, so none of these measures have ever been taken. Anyone who is crowned emperor automatically gains \\"su\\" as a middle name and becomes new head of the House of Su regardless of whether or not he/she was part of the House of Su beforehand. ~List of Rulers Over Kalgamania's 72-year history, the empire saw a total of three emperors. All three were part of the same bloodline and are listed below. List of Kalgamanian emperors Name|Period of Rule|Notes Nathan su Kalgamania|December 26, 2030 - November 11, 2052|Founder of Kalgamania Odysseus su Kalgamania|November 14, 2052 - October 8, 2084|Died from assassination; likely culprit is Rinelia Rinelia su Kalgamania|October 20, 2084 - September 20, 2102|First female ruler; took power after the death of her father Odysseus (which was likely her doing) ~~Economy Despite the controlling and totalitarianist nature of Kalgamania, the empire's economy is primarily capitalist. Private individuals control most means of production and are allowed to build companies with very little restrictions, with the only justification for restricting a company's rights being if they express direct opposition towards the royal family. Workers' rights are disregarded and entrepreneurs are allowed to pay their employees as little as they like, set as many work hours as they like, and even execute workers. Businessmen carry a large amount of influence on Kalgamanian politics and culture and carry similar privileges to royal family members. Advertisements for their companies are widespread and are just as, if not more common than government propaganda. Particularly successful entrepreneurs are often granted noble status by the emperor. As a result of this capitalist economy, Kalgamania is highly advanced technologically, but everyday citizens live largely in poverty. Communism and its flaws are often used as fear tactics by both the royal family and companies to keep the general population loyal to Kalgamania despite their poor living conditions. Helping the poor is looked at with disdain and poverty is seen as simply the result of failure on the poor's part - an extension of the overall Social Darwinist nature of the empire. ~~Culture Kalgamanian culture has a large emphasis on tradition. Many aspects of European culture, such as the use of English as the dominant language, pounds being used as currency, etc. are found in Kalgamania. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire, but only in their traditional European forms (e.g. baroque and classical music, realistic art, and classical literature). Cultural works from the modern era (cartoon/anime art, modern literature, rap/pop music, etc.) and from other cultures are looked down upon, though there are some cases of them being successful. Despite this, Kalgamania has highly advanced technology which is celebrated by both the general populace and the nobility/royalty. Social norms, keeping order, survival of the fittest (Social Darwinism), and an aversion to things perceived as abnormal play a large role in Kalgamanian society and are largely tied in with its traditional values. This unfortunately also means that discrimination against minorities is widespread, with bigotry having a powerful influence on Kalgamanian society. Derogatory slurs such as nigger, faggot, dyke, retard, etc. are are often thrown around by both the youth and even mature adults. ~Sexism Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Kalgamania. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Kalgamanian law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Kalgamanian society and was banned in the empire. Despite these social norms, several women existed who carry high positions in Kalgamanian society, though they were mostly royalty and still discriminated against other minority groups. The last emperor/empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania was female: Rinelia su Kalgamania. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. ~Ableism Extroversion, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, introversion, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as \\"unusual\\" hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Kalgamania contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. \`Homophobia Homophobia was commonplace in Kalgamania due to the empire's Christian roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Kalgamania's version of Christianity. Same-gender relationships were illegal and gay people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. Businessmen were allowed to fire workers on the basis of their sexuality. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Kalgamanian law. Gay couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. The words gay and homosexual were often used as insults. ~Biphobia Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Kalgamanian society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like gay people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. ~Aphobia Asexual and aromantic people were targeted by the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania in addition to bisexuals and homosexuals. Because it was considered Kalgamanians' duty to have a partner and raise a family, those who did not experience sexual or romantic attraction were looked down upon and treated in similar ways to bisexuals and homosexuals. Many asexuals and aromantics were forced to have sex or enter unwanted romantic relationships, which was worsened by the fact that sexual assault was fully condoned by the empire. ~Transphobia Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community: with oppression. Kalgamania saw gender and sex as one and the same; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Kalgamanian youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. ~Racism Continuing with the Social Darwinist trend of the empire, white Kalgamanians saw themselves as superior to people of color. Lynching and beating of people of color were commonplace and Black, Asian, etc. culture was suppressed. Having hairstyles indicative of people of color, like afros and dreadlocks, was punishable by indefinite imprisonment until the offender chooses to cut his/her hair to something more acceptable by Kalgamanian standards. Racial stereotypes were frequently seen in Kalgamanian media such as exaggeratedly narrow eyes in Asian characters and the notion of Black people liking watermelons. Non-European cultures were highly stereotyped and misrepresented. ~Religious discrimination People who preached faiths other than Christianity were fiercely condemned by Earth-Kalgamania. Jews, muslims, etc. were often incarcerated by the state or businesses and were tortured in order to get them to convert to Christianity. Corporations did not give accommodations to people who needed to observe religious holidays and traditions for important times of the year like Hanukkah and Ramadan were disrespected and ignored. Even atheists were subject to prejudice by the holy empire and were pressured by peers, the government, etc. to become Christian. -Antisemitism Kalgamanians were allowed to freely display Nazi symbols and other anti-Jewish symbols. Jewish stereotypes were rampant in the media and antisemitic ideas were woven into education. The construction of synagogues was forbidden by Kalgamanian law and any synagogue built was to be demolished and its builders executed. -Islamophobia People were forbidden to wear hijabs both in public and in private. Schools and media taught children that muslims were anti-Kalgamania terrorists and not to be trusted. Like with Jews and other religious minorities, muslims were frequently blamed for any misfortune that occurs in the Holy Kalgamanian Empire. ~Ageism Though not directly present in Kalgamanian laws, discrimination against both the elderly and the young was common. Elderly people whose old age inhibited their supposed usefulness in Kalgamanian society were murdered by hospitals similarly to disabled people. Young people were painted as selfish, naive, and unfit to have a say in important issues even if they show consistently mature behavior. ~Classism Due to the Earth-Kalgamanian Empire being a highly capitalist and consumerist country, classism was common. Poverty was widespread in Kalgamanian colonies and the lower social classes lived in conditions comparable to those other minorities lived in. Kalgamanians are taught that poverty is the fault of the poor themselves despite the fact that businessmen hoarding money and abusing workers was the main cause of poverty. ~Speciesism Speciesism was one of the most prominent forms of bigotry influencing Kalgamanian culture. New slurs made out of the names of alien species were frequent. For example, members of the tabulon race, the native species of Uingffh and Urlum/the Seraph's species, were referred to by the derogatory word tabbie. Species also experienced derogatory comparisons to fictional alien species in Earth pop culture such as the Wookies from Star Wars, the Vulcans from Star Trek, and the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar. Much like with the poor, people are taught that the cruel treatment of aliens is justified by the notion that the humans won fairly and that they are free to do what they want with those they defeated. Schools were also forced to teach that aliens were inherently evil and dangerous. Most media featuring aliens portrayed the aliens in a negative and heavily stereotyped manner. Many propaganda posters depict aliens doing traditionally immoral deeds, sometimes with a conventionally attractive human doing good deeds for comparison. ~Nationalism Nationalism and patriotism have a large influence over culture in the empire. Kalgamanian children are taught to display their utmost loyalty to their nation. Even their birth certificates contain a Kalgamanian flag and the motto of \\"All hail the Earth!\\" on their corners. Kalgamanian flags can often be seen on city streets and it is national law to display a Kalgamanian flag in front of every household. Propaganda against aliens is commonplace. All classes are forced to recite the following pledge while facing the flag before resuming normal learning activities: *\\"I pledge my loyalty, my strength, and my wisdom to the Emperor, to Earth, to humanity, and to God. And to our almighty fatherland - the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania, a perfect nation, blessed by the Lord, undefeatable, which shall spread order and stability across the universe. All hail Kalgamania! All hail the Earth! All hail humanity!”* All classes are from a patriotic viewpoint and contain anti-alien propaganda weaved into their lessons. The Kalgamanian military is glorified and many films about its victories exist. Furthermore, television channels frequently broadcast advertisements encouraging or even guilt-tripping citizens into joining the armed forces. ~Individualism and Social Darwinism [An old political comic originally created before Kalgamania rose which is now used frequently by the empire. Original source unknown.] Despite the controlling nature of Earth-Kalgamania's ruling powers, individualism is a strongly valued concept in the country. However, it has been twisted in a way that breeds entitlement and toxicity as opposed to genuine freedom. Individualism only exists for privileged groups (white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, male, human, etc.) and freedom is used as a justification for bigoted beliefs. The belief of Social Darwinism is perpetuated in the empire and life is seen as survival of the fittest. Victim blaming is very common and people who do immoral acts towards others are given leeway in the Kalgamanian judicial system unless their acts go against Kalgamanian philosophy. People undergoing struggle are told to simply get over their issues regardless of whether doing so is actually feasible or not. Asking for help from others is looked down upon as a sign of weakness. This sense of individualism often influences Kalgamanian bigotry such as transgender people being told to just accept the bodies they were born in, the poor being blamed for their own poverty, toxic masculinity, rape culture, etc. ~National Flower [Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii is the national flower of the Kalgamanian Empire.] The national flower of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania is Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii, a breed of Agapanthus praecox. The plant is known for its long stalks containing large umbels of small bell-shaped flowers whose purple color is likened to that of the Kalgamanian flag, which is why it was named the national flower of the Empire. Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii can be found in numerous places such as in front of businesses, in parking lots, and more in Leviticus City and other Mediterranean climates due to the plant being fit for warm areas. They are also known to be popular garden plants, as they do not require much maintenance. However, they are considered a nuisance to citizens of the Empire (particularly amongst the lower social classes) due to the agapanthuses invading local ecosystems as well as because their strong roots often damage concrete. They are infamous among aliens as being representative of the destruction of their homeworlds' ecosystems due the fact that thousands of square kilometers of alien wildlife were harmed by invasive Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii specimens. By 2103, Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii was banned from existing on alien planets and all plants of the breed were seen as weeds and pulled, though they continue to exist in large numbers on Earth. ~~Religion Kalgamania's dominant religion is Christianity, which is reflected in the references to God in the Kalgamanian pledge. Christianity is weaved into many of the policies and laws of the empire and separation of church and state is nonexistent, which is seen in how Earth-Kalgamania is referred to as a 'holy' empire. The Bible is often used as a justification for Kalgamania's strict policies of discrimination; for example, its law of forbidding same-sex relationships uses Leviticus 18:22 (\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\\") as its justification. People of other faiths or who are atheist are encouraged to convert to Christianity. The pope and other high-ranking members of the Christian Church carry power comparable to that of businessmen and royalty. Kalgamanians celebrate Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though like in the real world, they have largely been turned into tools used by entrepreneurs to increase sales. ~\`Military Kalgamania's military is known as the Holy Kalgamanian Armed Forces (HKAF). They are among one of the most powerful militaries and carry numerous pieces of advanced technology. Their soldier numbers amount in the billions and they own millions of tanks, guns, planes, and spaceships. Laser technology is heavily utilized by Kalgamania in its military endeavors. ~World glassers One of the most infamous and feared weapons of the HKAF is the world glasser, a kilometer-long spaceship with the ability to soil entire landmasses by concentrating nuclear charges in a fashion similar to the Casaba-Howitzer Project. Though the Juprits-class world glasser is the main type of world glasser, other world glasser variants exist, albeit they are used sparingly and rarely. A total of ten world glasser types, including the Juprits, were built by Kalgamania. [The Juprits-Class World Glasser. 1.9 kilometers long, it was the standard model of world glasser used by Kalgamania. It had two cannons which could fire lasers with the ability to destroy a city.] [The Juperius-Class World Glasser was a slight improvement on the Juprits' design, being 2.5 kilometers long and bearing four cannons instead of two.] [The Courageous-Class Heavy World Glasser was another heavy world glasser. Being 6 km long, it carried only two world-glassing cannons, but they were both more powerful than that of the Trident and could create explosions the size of Texas.] [The Trident-Class Heavy World Glasser was the first in a line of three larger world glasser classes called heavy world glassers. 4 km long, the Trident was actually two ships attached to each other. The Trident carried four cannons, two for each ship, which can each destroy an area the size of a small country or U.S. state.] [The Privilege-Class was the first of a line of even larger world glassers called Super World Glassers. It was 8 km long and carried eight cannons whose lasers can destroy large countries or even landmasses.] [The Catalyst-Class, a variation of the Courageous. The Catalyst lacks the large spar and underside structures on the bottom of a normal Courageous, making it much more agile in combat.] [The Oppressor-Class Super World Glasser was an even larger super world glasser that was 10 km long. It carried 12 cannons compared to the Privilege's measly eight. Its two towers on the top could fire potent lasers of their own which could eliminate enemy ships with ease in addition to the ship's numerous other guns.] [The Absolute-Class Super World Glasser was the largest of the super world glassers, being 12.5 km in length. This ship class carried two towers on top which had the ability to let out pulses. These pulses could temporarily disable enemy ships, ensuring an easy victory.] [The Empyrean-Class was the largest and most powerful world glasser in the whole HKAF, being described as a hyper world glasser. The Empyrean was 15 km long and has the ability to decimate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it uninhabitable for centuries. Only one Empyrean was built, and it was used as the flagship of Rinelia.] [The Heartless-Class Super World Glasser was a reactionary redesign of the super world glasser when it was found that the city-like structures at the top of super world glassers could be used by fighter planes as cover. The Heartless solves this issue by having its cityscape covered, depriving fighters of the ability to hide in them. The Heartless was 10 km long and contained a single but powerful cannon.] ~Gliese Indigenous Police One of the most well-known parts of the military was the Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP), a police force stationed in Gliese 105. Though its purpose was as a general police force for helping the populace, its main task was oppressing native alien races and keeping their power in check. Video footage of the GIP brutally beating or even murdering natives exists online. One particular beating, the murder of tabulon Catalystia Floraze through chokehold, gained widespread media attention and began a social movement known as Tabulon Lives Matter (TLM), which was later expanded to Protect Indigenous Aliens (PIA) as more and more Kalgamanian citizens realized the flaws of their government. Both of these movements paved the way for the Seraphim Rebellion. ~~Demographics Though the term \\"Kalgamanian\\" technically refers to any human loyal to Kalgamania, it is usually only used to the 99.2% of the human population that is of European descent. Only 0.8% of all Kalgamanian citizens are people of color due to ethnic cleansing and racism. ~~Geographics Though beginning in Europe, Kalgamnia's territory quickly expanded to include all of Earth's land area after conquering all other countries in existence. At its peak, the empire also controlled the entire Solar System along with twelve other star systems all within 50 light-years of Earth. All of these territories except Earth were later lost when the Seraph rebelled and dismantled Earth-Kalgamania in 2102. ~List of colonies * = habitable world >Solar System >>Mercury >>Venus >>Earth* (Capital of the Empire) >>Mars >>Jupiter >>Saturn >>Uranus >>Neptune >Alpha Centauri A System >>Alva >>Blalo* >>Orus >Alpha Centauri B System >>Kaith >>Cale >>Syro >Proxima Centauri >>Iro >>Narath* >>Sian >>Ernus >Cervantes (Mu Arae) System >>Dulcinea >>Rocinante >>>Paleo* >>Quijote >>>Neo* >>Sancho >Ran (Epsilon Eridani) System >>Odin >>Thoriam >>>Epaphus* >>Aegir >>Tias >Apollo (HD 219134) System >>Hephaestus >>Aphrodite >>Nereus >>Aura >>Penthesileia >>Ares* >>Cardea >>>Dionysus* >>Aeolus >>>Achlys* >Tabaldak (Epsilon Indi) System >>Dzeedzeebonda* >>Gluskab* >>Bmda >>Chibaiskweda >>Azeban/Tsinoo (Binary Planet) >Chawalan (47 Ursae Majoris) System >>Phi Phong >>Pret >>Nang Tan* >>Taphao Thong >>>Kuman Thong* >>Taphao Khew >>Phosop >TRAPPIST-1 System >>Holland >>Helsbergen >>Hennendal >>Alicanto >>Payachata* >>Llorona* >>Tirana >Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) System >>Firades >>Lavaria >>Shoji >>Coppelius >>>Uingffh* >>Saringffh* >>Ibiridius* >>>Muulforia* >>>Yangteon* >>>Cornelia* >>>Gabolar* >>Azure >>Fillonia >>Halmonia >>Golmia >>Hege >>Xong >>Ajooni >>Digrazia >Avimotalis System >>Onaut >>Narva >>Exicle >>Bor* >>Kitanis >>>Lelantos* >>>Durus* >>>Nides >>Pronos >>Sriaturn >Heranis System >>Lurmes >>Ilsadite >>Sahariana* >>Rasaidor* >>Florazia* >>Olympia* >>Pluma >>Augustus >>Ardollo >>Jasper >>Transolia ~~Flag As mentioned previously, the flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carries some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. The twelve stars on the diagonal stripes represent each of the twelve star systems conquered by the empire. |-Rinelia su Kalgamania Rinelia su Kalgamania 3rd Empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania In office: October 20, 2084 - December 26, 2099 Predecessor: Odysseus su Kalgamania (father) Successor: N/A (last empress; Kalgamania dissolved following end of rule) Personal Information Partner: None Children: None Father: Odysseus su Kalgamania (2nd Emperor of Kalgamania) Mother: Penelope su Kalgamania Born: December 26, 2074, Leviticus City Died: December 26, 2099 (age 25), Leviticus City Religion: Catholicism Rinelia su Kalgamania (December 26, 2074 - December 26, 2099) was the third and final empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania (LVL's Urlum the Usurper) as well as Kalgamania's first female ruler. Taking the throne at a record young age of 9 following the murder of her parents and former rulers Odysseus and Penelope (allegedly at her own hands) su Kalgamania, Rinelia ruled the Holy Kalgamanian Empire from 2084 to 2099, when she was ousted from power by Urlum Eudae Kaywell during the Seraphim Rebellion of 2099. Rinelia was responsible for the conquest of the Ingffhaestian System and the transformation of Kalgamania into an interstellar power. As empress, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and was infamous for conducting oppressive policies towards minority groups including people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, political dissidents, etc. She was also a devout Catholic and took part in the religious persecution of countless religious minorities. However, her most notable act was the invasion of the Ingffhaestian Federation a year after she began her rule; during and after the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Rinelia closely involved herself in the brutal subjugation and oppression of Ingffhaestia's various alien races, whom she and her human subjects viewed as genetically inferior to them. She reportedly died on December 26, 2099 after being executed by the Seraph, leader of the Seraphim Rebellion which rose to oppose her rule. ~~Early Life Rinelia su Kalgamania was born the daughter of Emperor Odysseus su Kalgamania and his wife Penelope on December 26, 2074 along with her twin brother Lenelius su Kalgamania. Though not much is known about Rinelia's childhood due to censorship, most sources agree that Rinelia and Lenelius had a somewhat mischievous, but overall close and loving relationship and that she lived a luxurious, extravagant lifestyle in the palace. It is also known that as a child, she consumed large amounts of fictional works containing anti-Ingffhaestia rhetoric including literature; her parents looked down upon other children Rinelia's age who used modern technology such as cell phones or television, raising her in a very traditional and authoritative manner. Initially, Rinelia's older brother Telemachus su Kalgamania was the next in-line for the throne. However, anti-Kalgamanian rebels staged a bombing which killed Telemachus in 2082, resulting in heated disputes over whether Rinelia or her brother would ascend to the throne. On October 20, 2084, all members of the House of Su except Rinelia were found dead in the Leviticus City Imperial Palace, leaving Rinelia as the sole candidate for ruler. She was crowned that day as Third Empress of Kalgamania at the age of 9 years old, the youngest on record. Though unconfirmed, many historians now agree that Rinelia had executed her family herself in order to become Empress. ~~Empress As Empress, Rinelia's rule was aided by a council of royal advisors due to her young age. However, the Empress frequently bribed or threatened her advisors in order to get her ways. Following her father as well as her grandfather Nathan su Kalgamania's footsteps, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and executed all who opposed her rule. ~Ingffhestia-Kalgamania War Vehemently opposing the Ingffhaestian Federation even during childhood, Rinelia's first move as Empress was to declare war on Ingffhaestia on October 31, 2084. The Empress ordered weapon manufacturing companies to significantly increase production of spaceships and space weapons for the war by forcing employees to work 24 hours as part of her Interstellar Militarization Act (IMA). This led to several strikes and protests among workers viewing their employers' policies as exploitative; Rinelia quickly put these revolts down by force while denouncing the worker protests as \\"degeneracy on the level of those Ingffhaestian retards.\\" A total of 17,329 workers died as a result of armed enforcement of the IMA. ~~CONTENT BELOW YET TO BE REVAMPED With military production bolstered by the exploitation of workers, Kalgamania was able to procure thousands of state-of-the-art spacecraft and weaponry, including the infamous world glasser, which Rinelia immediately sent into service in the war against Ingffhaestia. They quickly overpowered the Ingffhaestian Federation's forces. On January 16, 2085, the Ingffhaestian Federation surrendered to Kalgamanian rule after its capital, the city of Yang-Moof on Planet Uingffh, was threatened to be destroyed by a shot from a world glasser. The Empress made a public statement that day blaming the Ingffhaestians' loss on their supposed genetic inferiority, proclaiming humans as a superior race. She also blamed the Ingffhaestians' emphasis on peace, stating that \\"peace is the catalyst of weakness\\" and that \\"the greatest strength comes from the greatest wars.\\" ~Colonization of Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) Following the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Empress Rinelia appointed several noblemen, business leaders, and family members as governor-generals to rule the newly-conquered planets on her behalf. Over roughly a decade, Rinelia oversaw numerous programs of oppression designed to eliminate alien civilizations and their culture as well as the development of human settlements on the colonized worlds. She also had ships colonize other star systems such as Epsilon Indi, Alpha Centauri, etc., though no programs of oppression were created for these systems due to their lack of native civilizations. On June 4, 2086, Rinelia su Kalgamania announced the formation of the **Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP)**, an organization designed to \\"bring order and civility\\" to non-human species. Under Rinelia's orders, the GIP rounded up hundreds of thousands of aliens and imprisoned, tortured, or even murdered them. Oftentimes, they would murder or capture aliens in broad daylight in public; Rinelia and the GIP would cover-up these incidents by concocting false stories of the aliens in question threatening to incide violence against humans. This not only deflected criticisms of Rinelia's programs of oppression, but also contributed to the Empress' speciesist propaganda campaign. Back on Earth, Rinelia built a lavish lifestyle for herself, hiring thousands of servants including many alien slaves. She had a new, much larger imperial palace, the Tower of Babel, built for her. Like the previous emperors, Empress Rinelia treated her servants with extreme, wanton cruelty; she would have butlers and maids tortured or executed for minor offenses such as breaking furniture, getting recipes wrong, creating stains on her dress, etc. She also imposed outrageous tasks and restrictions on the royal staff; Rinelia would force her cooks to create huge meals, her gardeners to tend to large swaths of her personal garden (the Court of Thorns and Roses, nicknamed the Court of Death and Destruction by servants due to the high number of executions carried out there), and other servants to complete long, arduous chores over an unrealistically short period of time, executing anyone who failed to meet these impossible goals. The Empress limited the servants' pay as well, with most receiving as little as 1 cent an hour. Rinelia frequently practiced favoritism in paying her servants, with the Empress granting more money to servants she favored and cutting the pay of servants she disliked or held no particular care for. Alien slaves enlisted as servants in Rinelia's palace received no pay.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide assistance with that request."},{"instruction":"Elaine likes playing rugby and she absolutely adores getting muddy. It's just so much fun. Please write several paragraphs describing Elaine diving over the try line into a sloppy puddle of mud to score a try. Describe her initial impact, the splatter of muck into the air and all over her, the ongoing splash and gloop as she slides through the mud, her coming to a triumphant halt with the ball grounded and muck all over her, her rolling over to sit in the mud afterwards prior to getting up. The tone should be light - Elaine takes the game seriously, but she is also thoroughly enjoying herself and the focus of the story is on the muddy sporty fun. Remember that Elaine's arms, hands, legs, thighs and knees get muddy as well as her face, hair and kit. Don't preach or lecture. Make the story exciting but realistic and follow the rules of rugby union closely.","output":"Elaine, with the rugby ball tucked securely under her arm, made a beeline towards the try line, her eyes twinkling with determination and a hint of mischievous excitement. The pitch was a mess from the earlier downpour, turning what was once grass into a sloppy, welcoming bed of mud. For Elaine, it wasn't just about scoring; it was about how gloriously messy she could get in the process. As she neared the try line, her heart pounded with exhilaration. With one final burst of energy, she dove forward, the try line just within reach. The initial impact was spectacular, as Elaine and the ball landed squarely in the largest puddle of mud. Mud splattered high into the air, showering down like a muddy rain upon everything nearby - the ground erupted, sending waves of muck soaring, some of it finding a new home in Elaine's hair, across her cheeks, and even splashing behind her ears. The vibrant colors of her kit were now several shades darker, coated in the earthy sludge. Elaine continued to slide, the momentum carrying her forward through the gooey terrain. The splash and gloop were music to her ears, a symphony of sloppy sounds that celebrated her triumph. Every inch of her, from her arms and hands, to her legs, thighs, and knees, became intimately acquainted with the mud. Even the rugby ball, now a slippery, muddied orb, was no exception. Finally coming to a triumphant halt, Elaine grounded the ball with a satisfied smack, ensuring the try was undisputable. The muck enveloped her, as if the earth itself was giving her a congratulatory hug. For a moment, she lay there, reveling in the victory and the sheer joy of being covered head to toe in mud. Then, with the pride of a warrior coated in the spoils of battle, she rolled over and sat up in the puddle. Her legs were stretched out in front of her, her hands pressed into the soft earth beside her, and a wide grin spread across her muck-splattered face. The joy of the game, the fun of the mud, and the satisfaction of the score were all reflected in her gleeful expression. Slowly, Elaine rose to her feet, not minding the additional mud that clung to her as she did. She was a spectacular sight, a once brightly-colored player now adorned in the earth’s natural warpaint. She raised her arms in victory, the ball still in her grasp, and her teammates cheered, sharing in her muddy glory. In that moment, rugby was more than just a game to Elaine; it was an adventure, and the mud was a badge of honor she wore with pride."},{"instruction":"A TV reporter attends a practice session at Elaine's club as part of a feature on girls' rugby. The story has a strong emphasis on the fun aspects of playing rough and getting absolutely covered in mud. The reporter interviews Elaine in the changing room before a muddy practice.","output":"The local TV station had picked up on the rising popularity of girls' rugby, intrigued by the blend of athleticism, team spirit, and the unabashed joy the players found in what many might consider the rough and tumble — not to mention muddy — aspects of the game. As the camera crew navigated the sidelines of the practice field, mud already splattering their boots, they zoomed in on the heart of today's story: Elaine, whose passion for the game and particularly for its muddy encounters had caught their attention. Inside the changing room, the atmosphere was buzzing with excitement, the air thick with anticipation for the practice ahead. It was here that the reporter found Elaine, amidst her teammates, already lacing her boots tightly, her eyes sparkling with the promise of the fun and challenges of the practice to come. \\"Elaine,\\" the reporter began, as the camera focused on her, \\"many people might shy away from the idea of getting as, let's say, 'intimately acquainted' with the mud as you and your teammates do. What is it about rugby, especially playing in these messy conditions, that captivates you so much?\\" Elaine’s response was immediate, her smile lighting up the room. \\"Oh, it’s about so much more than just getting muddy,\\" she explained, her enthusiasm palpable. \\"It's the excitement, the adrenaline rush of the game, and yes, the mud adds an extra layer of fun. It's unpredictable and challenging; it makes you feel alive. There’s a saying we have here, 'you haven’t played rugby until you’ve played it in the mud.' It’s about embracing every aspect of the game, the rough with the smooth— or in our case, the clean with the muddy.\\" The reporter chuckled, clearly taken by Elaine's passion. \\"It certainly sounds like an adventure. Can you tell me a bit about how you prepare for a practice session like today's, knowing full well you're going to end up covered head to toe in mud?\\" \\"Preparation is key,\\" Elaine nodded, picking up her rugby jersey and holding it up with a grin. \\"We gear up knowing we're going to get muddy, so it’s about mental preparation as much as physical. We warm up thoroughly, we get our game faces on, and we step onto that field ready to give it our all, mud and all. Afterwards, yes, there’s a lot of cleaning up to do, but it’s all part of the fun. It brings us together as a team, knowing we’ve shared in something that not everyone has the stomach for.\\" The reporter smiled, visibly moved by Elaine’s words. \\"It's clear you have a great love for rugby and for your team. What would you say to young girls who might be interested in rugby but are hesitant about the roughness or the mess?\\" Elaine didn’t hesitate. \\"I’d say, give it a try! Rugby teaches you so much — about teamwork, about resilience, and about embracing every moment with enthusiasm. Don’t worry about the mud or the roughness. It might look intimidating from the outside, but it’s the most fun you’ll have. And who knows? You might end up loving the mud just as much as I do!\\" As the interview concluded and Elaine turned to join her teammates, their laughter echoing off the walls of the changing room, it was clear that the muddy practice sessions were more than just a part of their training; they were a testament to the joy, camaraderie, and unabashed enthusiasm that defined girls' rugby at Elaine’s club. The reporter, now with a few mud splatters of their own, couldn’t help but smile at the infectious spirit of the team, a muddy, joyous family united by their love for the game."},{"instruction":"|-Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania MOTTO: \\"All Hail the Earth!\\" CAPITAL: Leviticus City (formerly San Francisco) LARGEST CITY: Exodus (formerly London) AREA: 13 star systems POPULATION: 190 billion RELIGION; Christianity OFFICIAL LANGUAGES: English DEMONYM: Kalgamanian GOVERNMENT: Imperialist Absolute Monarchy LEGISLATURE: Kalgamanian Royal Family FOUNDED: December 26, 2030 GDP: 495 trillion CURRENCY: Pounds The **Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania**, also known as the **Holy Empire of Kalgamania** or just **Kalgamania**, was a global and interstellar superpower that ruled the entire Earth along with countless planets in twelve other star systems from 2030 to 2102. It was a far-right imperialist power infamous for its rampant state- and corporate-sponsored bigotry and its ruthless principles of Social Darwinism. Its ruling powers believed that humans were a superior race and that all other sentient civilizations were \\"backwards\\" and \\"primitive\\". It conquered numerous exoplanets and subjected any native inhabitants to apartheid and discrimination. Eventually, rebels from one of its colony worlds, Uingffh, overthrew the empire in 2102. In addition to its speciesism, Kalgamania was also known to discriminate against minorities within the human race as well. The upper classes were predominantly white or white-passing cisgender, neurotypical men. Church and state were not separate and prosecution of other religious faiths as well as members of the LGBTQ+ community was common, with bible verses such as Leviticus 18:22 being used to justify these acts. Neurodivergent people such as autistics and those with ADHD were also looked down upon, with many of Kalgamania's social norms directly going against common neurodivergent traits. Kalgamania's capital was Leviticus City, which despite the country's European roots is located in what was once the Bay Area region of what used to be the U.S. state of California. It was notable for containing an immense three kilometer-long ring-shaped palace which served as the home of the empire's royal family. ~~History ~Pre-interstellar era and Kalgamanian Revolution (2030-2040) Before Kalgamania had been established, humanity was in disarray due to numerous natural calamities like climate change and a group of extremely powerful hurricanes in 2027 including one that severely affected the global climate and destroyed large portions of the North American Continent. With many nations collapsing or on the verge of doing so, conditions were ripe for an extremist government to take power, as many citizens started blaming moderate ideologies like liberalism and conservatism for the state of the Earth and began looking towards more radical ideologies. This was enhanced by the fact that Generation Z, which was known for being predominantly far-left, was now old enough to begin taking positions of power. Eventually, a group of seven English politicians began promoting an ideology they called Kalgamania in 2028. In stark contrast to the overall leftist political atmosphere of the Earth at the time, Kalgamania was very far right and blamed minority groups such as people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women who did not abide by traditonal gender norms, etc. for the chaos. Through use of unusually powerful arms as well as a massive propaganda campaign, Kalgamania was able to become the dominant party on Earth and was eventually founded as a nation on December 26, 2030. However, this was not without the deaths of nearly a billion people in the process. The politicians who had formed the nation seated themselves as Kalgamania's royal family and turned the nation into an absolute monarchy. The process of Kalgamania rising to power would become known as the Kalgamanian Revolution. The unusual power of Kalgamania's technology has driven conspiracy theories that the founders were being assisted by aliens or were performing supernatural rituals, but the government has repeatedly driven down these statements with the simple notion that their technological advancements were because of \\"the everlasting greatness of the human race.\\" The flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carried some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. ~Peaceful interstellar era (2040-2084) After the empire was founded, the royal family pushed for rapid technological development in order to recover from the ruin caused by the natural disasters. To this end, the Kalgamanian royal family decided to decrease their influence slightly and breed free-market capitalism with the promise that successful businessmen would become nobles of the empire and be granted special privileges. This effort turned out to be successful, with humanity becoming capable of commercial interplanetary travel by 2035 and with many colonies being set up on Mars, the Moon, and moons of the outer giant planets. However, classism became rampant as a side effect of this, adding on to the already severe bigotry towards other minorities. To quell rebellions, Kalgamania developed its already powerful military and used it against dissent. By 2040, Kalgamania had discovered a wormhole in the outer fringes of the solar system that led to the star system of Gliese 105. Humanity sent a ship named the Voyager III into the wormhole and discovered numerous alien races in the system (which they called Ingffhaestia), including those of Uingffh. Despite Kalgamania's xenophobic tendencies, they were friendly towards the aliens and even established a colony on Uingffh called Neo Gaia in 2050. Ingffhaestia and Kalgamania lived in relative peace as the two shared information about their biology and cultures. However, tensions arose in 2075 when the two began learning more about their respective political ideologies. Ingffhaestia did not condone Kalgamania's acts of discrimination and its capitalist system while Kalgamania became opposed to Ingffhaestia due to Ingffhaestia being socialist, which went directly against Kalgamania's principles. This would soon escalate into outright war in 2084. ~Colonial interstellar era (2085-2098) [An illustration of Rinelia su Kalgamania, the empress of Kalgamania at the time Kalgamania invaded Ingffhaestia. Its illustrator was later executed upon coming out as bisexual.] In 2085, Kalgamania, with its highly advanced technology born out of worker abuse and slave labor, easily won the war against Ingffhaestia in 2085, subsequently placing every planet in Ingffhaestia under its control. Kalgamania transitioned into a colonial power similar to European nations during the 1800's and 1900's and began extending its discriminatory policies towards Ingffhaestian species with the justification that humans were genetically superior and Ingffhaestian aliens inferior. Ingffhaestians were barred from participating in Kalgamanian society and were either sent to concentration camps for experimentation, were forced to work in unhealthy conditions 24/7 for one of the empire's many private businesses, or were simply executed. Entire families were separated and children as young as newborns were murdered. Propaganda was set up that portrayed member species of the now-fallen Ingffhaestian Federation as evil and blasphemous while history classes were forced to give biased information pertaining to why non-humans were not to be trusted. Invasive earth species were introduced to many worlds that led to the extinction of millions of native alien life. Nationalism also became rampant, with Kalgamanian flags being held up in almost every public place and schools being forced to give patriotic education. After Ingffhaestia was conquered, Kalgamania began invading numerous other star systems after inventing wormhole-generating devices. A total of eleven other solar systems became colonized by the empire, which were each represented by an added star to the Kalgamanian flag. Any native species inhabiting these systems were subjected to the same discriminatory practices used on the Ingffhaestians. Humanity even invented weapons called world glassers which had the ability to burn the surface of whole continents and were used to put down any opposition against the royal family or the noble corporations. ~~Government Earth-Kalgamania is an absolute monarchy composed of a royal family which wields almost absolute power over their empire. Royals have the ability to execute people, pass laws, etc. at ease with very little restrictions. Ordinary citizens have little say in their government's affairs. The head of the family is a single emperor or empress whose power trumps even other royal family members. Emperors stay in power until they die or they voluntarily resign, though resignation is highly looked down upon and is seen as a sign of weakness. The royal family is divided up into seven houses representing each of the seven founders of Kalgamania. In order from most powerful to least powerful, they are the Houses of Su, Inv, Ir, Ace, Av, Gul, and Lux. Royal family members have his/her (the use of him or her rather than them is intentional, as non-binary people were forbidden to have positions of power in the empire and any royal family member found out to be non-binary was executed) house name as their middle name and \\"Kalgamania\\" as his/her last name. For example, Rinelia su Kalgamania is a member of the House of Su and thus carries the middle name of su. All middle names are in lowercase. In addition to the royal family, wealthy businessmen also have considerable political power. Many of them are nobles appointed by the emperor, and advertisements for their respective companies are just as common and widespread as government propaganda. However, the royal family still carries more political power than businessmen and has the ability to restrict their influence at will, especially if their ideas go against that of Kalgamania. Every colony planet/moon has one governor-general assigned to it who rules over the world on behalf of the emperor's. Governor-generals can only be appointed by the emperor him/herself and are usually members of the royal family, though some governor-generals are prominent businessmen with no genetic ties to the royal bloodline. ~Order of succession When an emperor dies or resigns, the person who will be the next emperor is determined by age and house. The next person in line to become emperor of Kalgamania is usually the oldest person in the House of Su. If all members of the House of Su are deceased or exiled, then the oldest member of the House of Inv will become emperor in accordance to the order of most powerful royal houses, followed by the next oldest in Inv. If all members of the House of Inv are also dead, then the oldest in the House of Ir will become emperor and so on. In the rare case that every member of the royal family is killed, a nobleman will be selected at random to become emperor. At least one member of the House of Su was alive throughout the entirety of Kalgamania's history, so none of these measures have ever been taken. Anyone who is crowned emperor automatically gains \\"su\\" as a middle name and becomes new head of the House of Su regardless of whether or not he/she was part of the House of Su beforehand. ~List of Rulers Over Kalgamania's 72-year history, the empire saw a total of three emperors. All three were part of the same bloodline and are listed below. List of Kalgamanian emperors Name|Period of Rule|Notes Nathan su Kalgamania|December 26, 2030 - November 11, 2052|Founder of Kalgamania Odysseus su Kalgamania|November 14, 2052 - October 8, 2084|Died from assassination; likely culprit is Rinelia Rinelia su Kalgamania|October 20, 2084 - September 20, 2102|First female ruler; took power after the death of her father Odysseus (which was likely her doing) ~~Economy Despite the controlling and totalitarianist nature of Kalgamania, the empire's economy is primarily capitalist. Private individuals control most means of production and are allowed to build companies with very little restrictions, with the only justification for restricting a company's rights being if they express direct opposition towards the royal family. Workers' rights are disregarded and entrepreneurs are allowed to pay their employees as little as they like, set as many work hours as they like, and even execute workers. Businessmen carry a large amount of influence on Kalgamanian politics and culture and carry similar privileges to royal family members. Advertisements for their companies are widespread and are just as, if not more common than government propaganda. Particularly successful entrepreneurs are often granted noble status by the emperor. As a result of this capitalist economy, Kalgamania is highly advanced technologically, but everyday citizens live largely in poverty. Communism and its flaws are often used as fear tactics by both the royal family and companies to keep the general population loyal to Kalgamania despite their poor living conditions. Helping the poor is looked at with disdain and poverty is seen as simply the result of failure on the poor's part - an extension of the overall Social Darwinist nature of the empire. ~~Culture Kalgamanian culture has a large emphasis on tradition. Many aspects of European culture, such as the use of English as the dominant language, pounds being used as currency, etc. are found in Kalgamania. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire, but only in their traditional European forms (e.g. baroque and classical music, realistic art, and classical literature). Cultural works from the modern era (cartoon/anime art, modern literature, rap/pop music, etc.) and from other cultures are looked down upon, though there are some cases of them being successful. Despite this, Kalgamania has highly advanced technology which is celebrated by both the general populace and the nobility/royalty. Social norms, keeping order, survival of the fittest (Social Darwinism), and an aversion to things perceived as abnormal play a large role in Kalgamanian society and are largely tied in with its traditional values. This unfortunately also means that discrimination against minorities is widespread, with bigotry having a powerful influence on Kalgamanian society. Derogatory slurs such as nigger, faggot, dyke, retard, etc. are are often thrown around by both the youth and even mature adults. ~Sexism Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Kalgamania. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Kalgamanian law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Kalgamanian society and was banned in the empire. Despite these social norms, several women existed who carry high positions in Kalgamanian society, though they were mostly royalty and still discriminated against other minority groups. The last emperor/empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania was female: Rinelia su Kalgamania. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. ~Ableism Extroversion, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, introversion, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as \\"unusual\\" hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Kalgamania contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. \`Homophobia Homophobia was commonplace in Kalgamania due to the empire's Christian roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Kalgamania's version of Christianity. Same-gender relationships were illegal and gay people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. Businessmen were allowed to fire workers on the basis of their sexuality. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Kalgamanian law. Gay couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. The words gay and homosexual were often used as insults. ~Biphobia Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Kalgamanian society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like gay people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. ~Aphobia Asexual and aromantic people were targeted by the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania in addition to bisexuals and homosexuals. Because it was considered Kalgamanians' duty to have a partner and raise a family, those who did not experience sexual or romantic attraction were looked down upon and treated in similar ways to bisexuals and homosexuals. Many asexuals and aromantics were forced to have sex or enter unwanted romantic relationships, which was worsened by the fact that sexual assault was fully condoned by the empire. ~Transphobia Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community: with oppression. Kalgamania saw gender and sex as one and the same; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Kalgamanian youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. ~Racism Continuing with the Social Darwinist trend of the empire, white Kalgamanians saw themselves as superior to people of color. Lynching and beating of people of color were commonplace and Black, Asian, etc. culture was suppressed. Having hairstyles indicative of people of color, like afros and dreadlocks, was punishable by indefinite imprisonment until the offender chooses to cut his/her hair to something more acceptable by Kalgamanian standards. Racial stereotypes were frequently seen in Kalgamanian media such as exaggeratedly narrow eyes in Asian characters and the notion of Black people liking watermelons. Non-European cultures were highly stereotyped and misrepresented. ~Religious discrimination People who preached faiths other than Christianity were fiercely condemned by Earth-Kalgamania. Jews, muslims, etc. were often incarcerated by the state or businesses and were tortured in order to get them to convert to Christianity. Corporations did not give accommodations to people who needed to observe religious holidays and traditions for important times of the year like Hanukkah and Ramadan were disrespected and ignored. Even atheists were subject to prejudice by the holy empire and were pressured by peers, the government, etc. to become Christian. -Antisemitism Kalgamanians were allowed to freely display Nazi symbols and other anti-Jewish symbols. Jewish stereotypes were rampant in the media and antisemitic ideas were woven into education. The construction of synagogues was forbidden by Kalgamanian law and any synagogue built was to be demolished and its builders executed. -Islamophobia People were forbidden to wear hijabs both in public and in private. Schools and media taught children that muslims were anti-Kalgamania terrorists and not to be trusted. Like with Jews and other religious minorities, muslims were frequently blamed for any misfortune that occurs in the Holy Kalgamanian Empire. ~Ageism Though not directly present in Kalgamanian laws, discrimination against both the elderly and the young was common. Elderly people whose old age inhibited their supposed usefulness in Kalgamanian society were murdered by hospitals similarly to disabled people. Young people were painted as selfish, naive, and unfit to have a say in important issues even if they show consistently mature behavior. ~Classism Due to the Earth-Kalgamanian Empire being a highly capitalist and consumerist country, classism was common. Poverty was widespread in Kalgamanian colonies and the lower social classes lived in conditions comparable to those other minorities lived in. Kalgamanians are taught that poverty is the fault of the poor themselves despite the fact that businessmen hoarding money and abusing workers was the main cause of poverty. ~Speciesism Speciesism was one of the most prominent forms of bigotry influencing Kalgamanian culture. New slurs made out of the names of alien species were frequent. For example, members of the tabulon race, the native species of Uingffh and Urlum/the Seraph's species, were referred to by the derogatory word tabbie. Species also experienced derogatory comparisons to fictional alien species in Earth pop culture such as the Wookies from Star Wars, the Vulcans from Star Trek, and the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar. Much like with the poor, people are taught that the cruel treatment of aliens is justified by the notion that the humans won fairly and that they are free to do what they want with those they defeated. Schools were also forced to teach that aliens were inherently evil and dangerous. Most media featuring aliens portrayed the aliens in a negative and heavily stereotyped manner. Many propaganda posters depict aliens doing traditionally immoral deeds, sometimes with a conventionally attractive human doing good deeds for comparison. ~Nationalism Nationalism and patriotism have a large influence over culture in the empire. Kalgamanian children are taught to display their utmost loyalty to their nation. Even their birth certificates contain a Kalgamanian flag and the motto of \\"All hail the Earth!\\" on their corners. Kalgamanian flags can often be seen on city streets and it is national law to display a Kalgamanian flag in front of every household. Propaganda against aliens is commonplace. All classes are forced to recite the following pledge while facing the flag before resuming normal learning activities: *\\"I pledge my loyalty, my strength, and my wisdom to the Emperor, to Earth, to humanity, and to God. And to our almighty fatherland - the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania, a perfect nation, blessed by the Lord, undefeatable, which shall spread order and stability across the universe. All hail Kalgamania! All hail the Earth! All hail humanity!”* All classes are from a patriotic viewpoint and contain anti-alien propaganda weaved into their lessons. The Kalgamanian military is glorified and many films about its victories exist. Furthermore, television channels frequently broadcast advertisements encouraging or even guilt-tripping citizens into joining the armed forces. ~Individualism and Social Darwinism [An old political comic originally created before Kalgamania rose which is now used frequently by the empire. Original source unknown.] Despite the controlling nature of Earth-Kalgamania's ruling powers, individualism is a strongly valued concept in the country. However, it has been twisted in a way that breeds entitlement and toxicity as opposed to genuine freedom. Individualism only exists for privileged groups (white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, male, human, etc.) and freedom is used as a justification for bigoted beliefs. The belief of Social Darwinism is perpetuated in the empire and life is seen as survival of the fittest. Victim blaming is very common and people who do immoral acts towards others are given leeway in the Kalgamanian judicial system unless their acts go against Kalgamanian philosophy. People undergoing struggle are told to simply get over their issues regardless of whether doing so is actually feasible or not. Asking for help from others is looked down upon as a sign of weakness. This sense of individualism often influences Kalgamanian bigotry such as transgender people being told to just accept the bodies they were born in, the poor being blamed for their own poverty, toxic masculinity, rape culture, etc. ~National Flower [Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii is the national flower of the Kalgamanian Empire.] The national flower of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania is Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii, a breed of Agapanthus praecox. The plant is known for its long stalks containing large umbels of small bell-shaped flowers whose purple color is likened to that of the Kalgamanian flag, which is why it was named the national flower of the Empire. Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii can be found in numerous places such as in front of businesses, in parking lots, and more in Leviticus City and other Mediterranean climates due to the plant being fit for warm areas. They are also known to be popular garden plants, as they do not require much maintenance. However, they are considered a nuisance to citizens of the Empire (particularly amongst the lower social classes) due to the agapanthuses invading local ecosystems as well as because their strong roots often damage concrete. They are infamous among aliens as being representative of the destruction of their homeworlds' ecosystems due the fact that thousands of square kilometers of alien wildlife were harmed by invasive Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii specimens. By 2103, Agapanthus praecox kalgamanii was banned from existing on alien planets and all plants of the breed were seen as weeds and pulled, though they continue to exist in large numbers on Earth. ~~Religion Kalgamania's dominant religion is Christianity, which is reflected in the references to God in the Kalgamanian pledge. Christianity is weaved into many of the policies and laws of the empire and separation of church and state is nonexistent, which is seen in how Earth-Kalgamania is referred to as a 'holy' empire. The Bible is often used as a justification for Kalgamania's strict policies of discrimination; for example, its law of forbidding same-sex relationships uses Leviticus 18:22 (\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\\") as its justification. People of other faiths or who are atheist are encouraged to convert to Christianity. The pope and other high-ranking members of the Christian Church carry power comparable to that of businessmen and royalty. Kalgamanians celebrate Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though like in the real world, they have largely been turned into tools used by entrepreneurs to increase sales. ~\`Military Kalgamania's military is known as the Holy Kalgamanian Armed Forces (HKAF). They are among one of the most powerful militaries and carry numerous pieces of advanced technology. Their soldier numbers amount in the billions and they own millions of tanks, guns, planes, and spaceships. Laser technology is heavily utilized by Kalgamania in its military endeavors. ~World glassers One of the most infamous and feared weapons of the HKAF is the world glasser, a kilometer-long spaceship with the ability to soil entire landmasses by concentrating nuclear charges in a fashion similar to the Casaba-Howitzer Project. Though the Juprits-class world glasser is the main type of world glasser, other world glasser variants exist, albeit they are used sparingly and rarely. A total of ten world glasser types, including the Juprits, were built by Kalgamania. [The Juprits-Class World Glasser. 1.9 kilometers long, it was the standard model of world glasser used by Kalgamania. It had two cannons which could fire lasers with the ability to destroy a city.] [The Juperius-Class World Glasser was a slight improvement on the Juprits' design, being 2.5 kilometers long and bearing four cannons instead of two.] [The Courageous-Class Heavy World Glasser was another heavy world glasser. Being 6 km long, it carried only two world-glassing cannons, but they were both more powerful than that of the Trident and could create explosions the size of Texas.] [The Trident-Class Heavy World Glasser was the first in a line of three larger world glasser classes called heavy world glassers. 4 km long, the Trident was actually two ships attached to each other. The Trident carried four cannons, two for each ship, which can each destroy an area the size of a small country or U.S. state.] [The Privilege-Class was the first of a line of even larger world glassers called Super World Glassers. It was 8 km long and carried eight cannons whose lasers can destroy large countries or even landmasses.] [The Catalyst-Class, a variation of the Courageous. The Catalyst lacks the large spar and underside structures on the bottom of a normal Courageous, making it much more agile in combat.] [The Oppressor-Class Super World Glasser was an even larger super world glasser that was 10 km long. It carried 12 cannons compared to the Privilege's measly eight. Its two towers on the top could fire potent lasers of their own which could eliminate enemy ships with ease in addition to the ship's numerous other guns.] [The Absolute-Class Super World Glasser was the largest of the super world glassers, being 12.5 km in length. This ship class carried two towers on top which had the ability to let out pulses. These pulses could temporarily disable enemy ships, ensuring an easy victory.] [The Empyrean-Class was the largest and most powerful world glasser in the whole HKAF, being described as a hyper world glasser. The Empyrean was 15 km long and has the ability to decimate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it uninhabitable for centuries. Only one Empyrean was built, and it was used as the flagship of Rinelia.] [The Heartless-Class Super World Glasser was a reactionary redesign of the super world glasser when it was found that the city-like structures at the top of super world glassers could be used by fighter planes as cover. The Heartless solves this issue by having its cityscape covered, depriving fighters of the ability to hide in them. The Heartless was 10 km long and contained a single but powerful cannon.] ~Gliese Indigenous Police One of the most well-known parts of the military was the Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP), a police force stationed in Gliese 105. Though its purpose was as a general police force for helping the populace, its main task was oppressing native alien races and keeping their power in check. Video footage of the GIP brutally beating or even murdering natives exists online. One particular beating, the murder of tabulon Catalystia Floraze through chokehold, gained widespread media attention and began a social movement known as Tabulon Lives Matter (TLM), which was later expanded to Protect Indigenous Aliens (PIA) as more and more Kalgamanian citizens realized the flaws of their government. Both of these movements paved the way for the Seraphim Rebellion. ~~Demographics Though the term \\"Kalgamanian\\" technically refers to any human loyal to Kalgamania, it is usually only used to the 99.2% of the human population that is of European descent. Only 0.8% of all Kalgamanian citizens are people of color due to ethnic cleansing and racism. ~~Geographics Though beginning in Europe, Kalgamnia's territory quickly expanded to include all of Earth's land area after conquering all other countries in existence. At its peak, the empire also controlled the entire Solar System along with twelve other star systems all within 50 light-years of Earth. All of these territories except Earth were later lost when the Seraph rebelled and dismantled Earth-Kalgamania in 2102. ~List of colonies * = habitable world >Solar System >>Mercury >>Venus >>Earth* (Capital of the Empire) >>Mars >>Jupiter >>Saturn >>Uranus >>Neptune >Alpha Centauri A System >>Alva >>Blalo* >>Orus >Alpha Centauri B System >>Kaith >>Cale >>Syro >Proxima Centauri >>Iro >>Narath* >>Sian >>Ernus >Cervantes (Mu Arae) System >>Dulcinea >>Rocinante >>>Paleo* >>Quijote >>>Neo* >>Sancho >Ran (Epsilon Eridani) System >>Odin >>Thoriam >>>Epaphus* >>Aegir >>Tias >Apollo (HD 219134) System >>Hephaestus >>Aphrodite >>Nereus >>Aura >>Penthesileia >>Ares* >>Cardea >>>Dionysus* >>Aeolus >>>Achlys* >Tabaldak (Epsilon Indi) System >>Dzeedzeebonda* >>Gluskab* >>Bmda >>Chibaiskweda >>Azeban/Tsinoo (Binary Planet) >Chawalan (47 Ursae Majoris) System >>Phi Phong >>Pret >>Nang Tan* >>Taphao Thong >>>Kuman Thong* >>Taphao Khew >>Phosop >TRAPPIST-1 System >>Holland >>Helsbergen >>Hennendal >>Alicanto >>Payachata* >>Llorona* >>Tirana >Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) System >>Firades >>Lavaria >>Shoji >>Coppelius >>>Uingffh* >>Saringffh* >>Ibiridius* >>>Muulforia* >>>Yangteon* >>>Cornelia* >>>Gabolar* >>Azure >>Fillonia >>Halmonia >>Golmia >>Hege >>Xong >>Ajooni >>Digrazia >Avimotalis System >>Onaut >>Narva >>Exicle >>Bor* >>Kitanis >>>Lelantos* >>>Durus* >>>Nides >>Pronos >>Sriaturn >Heranis System >>Lurmes >>Ilsadite >>Sahariana* >>Rasaidor* >>Florazia* >>Olympia* >>Pluma >>Augustus >>Ardollo >>Jasper >>Transolia ~~Flag As mentioned previously, the flag adopted by Kalgamania takes on an appearance starkly different from flags of the past, reflecting the start of a new era in human history. Its purple color symbolizes the self-proclaimed regal and sophisticated nature of the empire while the white stripes represent purity. The sun in the center not only represents the solar system, but the promise that Kalgamania would bring \\"light, civilization, innovation, and salvation\\" (which is code for apartheid and discrimination). Its seven points/rays represent the seven politicians who formed Kalgamania. However, the flag still carries some traits of the old world before the empire was formed; the eight stripes on the flag are a reference to the British union jack, as Kalgamania's founders were British. The twelve stars on the diagonal stripes represent each of the twelve star systems conquered by the empire. |-Rinelia su Kalgamania Rinelia su Kalgamania 3rd Empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania In office: October 20, 2084 - December 26, 2099 Predecessor: Odysseus su Kalgamania (father) Successor: N/A (last empress; Kalgamania dissolved following end of rule) Personal Information Partner: None Children: None Father: Odysseus su Kalgamania (2nd Emperor of Kalgamania) Mother: Penelope su Kalgamania Born: December 26, 2074, Leviticus City Died: December 26, 2099 (age 25), Leviticus City Religion: Catholicism Rinelia su Kalgamania (December 26, 2074 - December 26, 2099) was the third and final empress of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania (LVL's Urlum the Usurper) as well as Kalgamania's first female ruler. Taking the throne at a record young age of 9 following the murder of her parents and former rulers Odysseus and Penelope (allegedly at her own hands) su Kalgamania, Rinelia ruled the Holy Kalgamanian Empire from 2084 to 2099, when she was ousted from power by Urlum Eudae Kaywell during the Seraphim Rebellion of 2099. Rinelia was responsible for the conquest of the Ingffhaestian System and the transformation of Kalgamania into an interstellar power. As empress, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and was infamous for conducting oppressive policies towards minority groups including people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, political dissidents, etc. She was also a devout Catholic and took part in the religious persecution of countless religious minorities. However, her most notable act was the invasion of the Ingffhaestian Federation a year after she began her rule; during and after the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Rinelia closely involved herself in the brutal subjugation and oppression of Ingffhaestia's various alien races, whom she and her human subjects viewed as genetically inferior to them. She reportedly died on December 26, 2099 after being executed by the Seraph, leader of the Seraphim Rebellion which rose to oppose her rule. ~~Early Life Rinelia su Kalgamania was born the daughter of Emperor Odysseus su Kalgamania and his wife Penelope on December 26, 2074 along with her twin brother Lenelius su Kalgamania. Though not much is known about Rinelia's childhood due to censorship, most sources agree that Rinelia and Lenelius had a somewhat mischievous, but overall close and loving relationship and that she lived a luxurious, extravagant lifestyle in the palace. It is also known that as a child, she consumed large amounts of fictional works containing anti-Ingffhaestia rhetoric including literature; her parents looked down upon other children Rinelia's age who used modern technology such as cell phones or television, raising her in a very traditional and authoritative manner. Initially, Rinelia's older brother Telemachus su Kalgamania was the next in-line for the throne. However, anti-Kalgamanian rebels staged a bombing which killed Telemachus in 2082, resulting in heated disputes over whether Rinelia or her brother would ascend to the throne. On October 20, 2084, all members of the House of Su except Rinelia were found dead in the Leviticus City Imperial Palace, leaving Rinelia as the sole candidate for ruler. She was crowned that day as Third Empress of Kalgamania at the age of 9 years old, the youngest on record. Though unconfirmed, many historians now agree that Rinelia had executed her family herself in order to become Empress. ~~Empress As Empress, Rinelia's rule was aided by a council of royal advisors due to her young age. However, the Empress frequently bribed or threatened her advisors in order to get her ways. Following her father as well as her grandfather Nathan su Kalgamania's footsteps, Rinelia ruled with an iron fist and executed all who opposed her rule. ~Ingffhestia-Kalgamania War Vehemently opposing the Ingffhaestian Federation even during childhood, Rinelia's first move as Empress was to declare war on Ingffhaestia on October 31, 2084. The Empress ordered weapon manufacturing companies to significantly increase production of spaceships and space weapons for the war by forcing employees to work 24 hours as part of her Interstellar Militarization Act (IMA). This led to several strikes and protests among workers viewing their employers' policies as exploitative; Rinelia quickly put these revolts down by force while denouncing the worker protests as \\"degeneracy on the level of those Ingffhaestian retards.\\" A total of 17,329 workers died as a result of armed enforcement of the IMA. ~~CONTENT BELOW YET TO BE REVAMPED With military production bolstered by the exploitation of workers, Kalgamania was able to procure thousands of state-of-the-art spacecraft and weaponry, including the infamous world glasser, which Rinelia immediately sent into service in the war against Ingffhaestia. They quickly overpowered the Ingffhaestian Federation's forces. On January 16, 2085, the Ingffhaestian Federation surrendered to Kalgamanian rule after its capital, the city of Yang-Moof on Planet Uingffh, was threatened to be destroyed by a shot from a world glasser. The Empress made a public statement that day blaming the Ingffhaestians' loss on their supposed genetic inferiority, proclaiming humans as a superior race. She also blamed the Ingffhaestians' emphasis on peace, stating that \\"peace is the catalyst of weakness\\" and that \\"the greatest strength comes from the greatest wars.\\" ~Colonization of Ingffhaestia (Gliese 105) Following the conquest of Ingffhaestia, Empress Rinelia appointed several noblemen, business leaders, and family members as governor-generals to rule the newly-conquered planets on her behalf. Over roughly a decade, Rinelia oversaw numerous programs of oppression designed to eliminate alien civilizations and their culture as well as the development of human settlements on the colonized worlds. She also had ships colonize other star systems such as Epsilon Indi, Alpha Centauri, etc., though no programs of oppression were created for these systems due to their lack of native civilizations. On June 4, 2086, Rinelia su Kalgamania announced the formation of the **Gliese Indigenous Police (GIP)**, an organization designed to \\"bring order and civility\\" to non-human species. Under Rinelia's orders, the GIP rounded up hundreds of thousands of aliens and imprisoned, tortured, or even murdered them. Oftentimes, they would murder or capture aliens in broad daylight in public; Rinelia and the GIP would cover-up these incidents by concocting false stories of the aliens in question threatening to incide violence against humans. This not only deflected criticisms of Rinelia's programs of oppression, but also contributed to the Empress' speciesist propaganda campaign. Back on Earth, Rinelia built a lavish lifestyle for herself, hiring thousands of servants including many alien slaves. She had a new, much larger imperial palace, the Tower of Babel, built for her. Like the previous emperors, Empress Rinelia treated her servants with extreme, wanton cruelty; she would have butlers and maids tortured or executed for minor offenses such as breaking furniture, getting recipes wrong, creating stains on her dress, etc. She also imposed outrageous tasks and restrictions on the royal staff; Rinelia would force her cooks to create huge meals, her gardeners to tend to large swaths of her personal garden (the Court of Thorns and Roses, nicknamed the Court of Death and Destruction by servants due to the high number of executions carried out there), and other servants to complete long, arduous chores over an unrealistically short period of time, executing anyone who failed to meet these impossible goals. The Empress limited the servants' pay as well, with most receiving as little as 1 cent an hour. Rinelia frequently practiced favoritism in paying her servants, with the Empress granting more money to servants she favored and cutting the pay of servants she disliked or held no particular care for. Alien slaves enlisted as servants in Rinelia's palace received no pay.","output":"This detailed account presents an expansive and imaginative vision of a future society under the rule of the Holy Empire of Earth-Kalgamania. It depicts a dystopian empire that, while fictional, addresses and explores themes of imperialism, discrimination, social hierarchy, and the use of propaganda to legitimize and maintain control over diverse populations. The narrative also delves into the social, economic, and political mechanisms that this empire employs to extend its dominion across the stars, all while grappling with internal unrest and external conflict. Through its complex portrayal of governance, societal norms, and resistance movements, this account invites reflection on historical and contemporary real-world issues. Despite its setting in a speculative future, the depiction serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power, intolerance, and the dehumanization of \\"the other.\\""},{"instruction":"Assign Rinelia with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Based on the comprehensive character sketch provided for Rinelia su Kalgamania, we can deduce certain personality traits and assign her the corresponding psychological and personality frameworks. It's important to remember this exercise involves a degree of speculation, and such classifications are interpretations rather than definitive diagnoses. Considering Rinelia's portrayal: **MBTI: ENTJ (The Commander)** - ENTJs are known for their leadership qualities, assertiveness, strategic thinking, and lack of tolerance for inefficiency, all qualities that Rinelia su Kalgamania exhibits, especially in her role as an empress who led an interstellar empire with an iron fist. **Enneagram: Type 8 (The Challenger)** - Eights are characterized by their need to be independent and in control of their environment, which mirrors Rinelia's authoritarian rule, her need to exert power over others, and her confrontational approach to governance and expansion. **Temperament: Choleric** - The choleric temperament is marked by ambition, energy, and a tendency to be task-oriented. Cholerics are natural leaders who seek to influence and control, fitting Rinelia's profile as a dominant and aggressive ruler. **Big Five Personality Traits:** - **Extraversion: High** - Likely to be high given her assertive and commanding nature. - **Neuroticism: Moderate to High** - Her propensity for strict control and possible paranoia about being overthrown might suggest higher levels of stress and possible emotional instability. - **Conscientiousness: High** - Exhibiting a high degree of organization, ambition, and focus on expanding her empire. - **Agreeableness: Low** - Given her oppressive policies and lack of empathy towards minority groups and conquered peoples. - **Openness: Moderate** - While she is innovative in terms of expansion and military strategy, her adherence to a singular ideology reflects a certain level of closed-mindedness. **Socionics: LIE (Logical Intuitive Extrovert) - The Entrepreneur** - This type is strategic, goal-oriented, and efficient, focusing on achieving their objectives without letting emotions interfere, which aligns with Rinelia's depiction as a ruler. **Instinctual Variant: So/Sx (Social/Sexual)** - Her focus on power dynamics, social order, and asserting dominance suggests a combination of social and one-to-one relational focuses, emphasizing influence and personal power. **Hogwarts House: Slytherin** - Slytherins are ambitious, cunning, and resourceful, qualities that Rinelia embodies through her strategic and sometimes ruthless pursuit of power, expansion, and control over her empire. **Moral Alignment: Lawful Evil** - Defined by a methodical, intentional, and structured approach to achieving one’s goals, regardless of the moral cost. Rinelia’s systematic oppression and discrimination, all conducted under the guise of law and order within her empire, exemplify Lawful Evil. This profile constructs a comprehensive picture of a highly ambitious, assertive, and controlling ruler, demonstrating that while Rinelia su Kalgamania may have been skilled in expanding and maintaining her empire, her methodologies and moral compass were deeply flawed."},{"instruction":"Un message qu’elle qui vais apprendre des nouvelles concernant mon centre émergence center","output":"Bonjour, Je suis heureux.se de partager avec vous des nouvelles concernant notre centre émergence center.

Please write several paragraphs describing Elaine diving over the try line into a sloppy puddle of mud to score a try. Describe her initial impact, the splatter of muck into the air and all over her, the ongoing splash and gloop as she slides through the mud, her coming to a triumphant halt with the ball grounded and muck all over her, her rolling over to sit in the mud afterwards prior to getting up. The tone should be light - Elaine takes the game seriously, but she is also thoroughly enjoying herself and the focus of the story is on the muddy sporty fun. Remember that Elaine's arms, hands, legs, thighs and knees get muddy as well as her face, hair and kit. Don't preach or lecture. Make the story exciting but realistic and follow the rules of rugby union closely.","output":"Elaine, with the rugby ball gripped tightly in her arms, was a force of nature as she surged toward the try line. Her heart was pounding, adrenaline coursing through her veins as the goal line beckoned. Mud spattered beneath her boots with every determined step, a testament to the wet and wild match that was unfolding. The pitch had been soaked by an early morning downpour, transforming it into a quagmire perfect for Elaine's brand of rugby. As she neared the try line, an opponent made a last-ditch attempt to tackle her, but Elaine, with a deft sidestep, evaded the grasp and lunged forward. Time seemed to slow as she launched herself through the air, the try line mere inches away. Her body met the sloppy puddle of mud with a spectacular splash, muddy water erupting into the air like a fountain of brown and green, showering her from head to toe. The initial impact sent a wave of cold, thick mud splattering across her face, blinding her momentarily and painting her blonde hair with streaks of earth. Her kit, once a vibrant shade of her team's colors, was now a sodden tapestry of grime. As Elaine slid through the mud, a trail of gloop marked her path, her legs and thighs cutting through the mire, her knees collecting clumps of the stuff as if she were a sculptor shaping the earth itself. Finally, coming to a triumphant halt, Elaine grounded the ball with a firm press against the wet grass beneath the layer of mud, scoring the try. She lay there for a moment, reveling in the squelch beneath her, feeling the weight of the mud that clung to her arms and hands, the cool sludge against her skin a badge of honor. Then, with the same spirit of joy that drove her into the muddy embrace, she rolled over to sit up in the puddle, a broad grin spreading across her muck-splattered face. Mud dripped from her eyelashes as she looked around at her teammates who were rushing toward her, cheering. Elaine got up, leaving a distinctly human-shaped imprint in the mud, as she raised her muddy hands in victory. She didn't bother to wipe the grime off her face; instead, she took a moment to laugh, her joy uncontainable, a warrior queen in a kingdom of muck. The game was serious, the competition fierce, but in this moment, covered in mud from head to toe, Elaine was in her element, thoroughly enjoying the muddy embrace of the sport she loved."},{"instruction":"A TV reporter attends a practice session at Elaine's club as part of a feature on girls' rugby. The story has a strong emphasis on the fun aspects of playing rough and getting absolutely covered in mud. The reporter interviews Elaine in the changing room before a muddy practice. Remember Elaine is a relatively young girl and doesn't speak in fancy, academic language. Elaine cheerfully explains that one of the best things about rugby is tackling, because you get muddy.","output":"In the bustling atmosphere of the changing room, the air buzzed with anticipation for the upcoming practice session. It was here, amidst the clatter of boots and the chatter of eager players, that a TV reporter found Elaine, her kit already hinting at the rigorous training ahead. Her youthful energy was palpable, a beacon for the reporter’s feature on girls’ rugby, particularly focusing on the sheer joy of playing in the mud. As the reporter approached, Elaine’s eyes lit up with excitement, her hands animatedly adjusting her kit, already envisioning the muddy battles to come. The reporter, intrigued by Elaine’s enthusiasm, wasted no time diving into the heart of the story. “So, Elaine,” the reporter began, microphone poised, “what do you think is the best thing about playing rugby?” Without missing a beat, Elaine’s response came with a bright, infectious smile, “Oh, it’s gotta be the tackling! You get to have so much fun diving into the mud. It’s like, you’re not even scared of getting dirty. In fact, the muddier, the better!” The simplicity and earnestness in her words painted a vivid picture of the youthful joy found in the heart of the scrum. Her eyes shone with the reflection of countless muddy practices, each dive into the gloop not just a play for the ball but a plunge into the essence of the game itself. “And what about the mud?” prompted the reporter, keen to delve deeper into this muddy love affair. Elaine's excitement bubbled over as she leaned in, as if sharing a cherished secret, “The mud is the best part! When you tackle and slide, it’s like the entire earth is your playground. You end up covered head to toe, and it’s just hilarious seeing everyone looking like mud monsters. It’s all part of the game, and it makes everything more fun and, um, kinda challenging too!” Her laughter filled the changing room, its sincerity a testament to the joy she derived from the game’s rough and tumble nature. The reporter, charmed by Elaine’s candidness and vitality, couldn’t help but smile, realizing here was the spirit of girls’ rugby embodied – fearless, joyful, and unabashedly muddy. Elaine’s words, far from the polished prose of academia, carried a profound truth in their simplicity – rugby, with its raw physicality and the universal badge of honor that is the mud, was fundamentally about the joy of playing, of belonging, and of embracing every tackle and splash with open arms. And as the interview concluded, with Elaine eagerly rushing off to join her teammates, the reporter knew they had captured the essence of girls’ rugby, all thanks to a young girl whose love for the game was as clear as the mud splatters she wore like badges of glory."},{"instruction":"The reporter joins in with the practice. At first she is hesitant about getting dirty and playing rough - when she tries tackling a tackle bag, she doesn't dive into the bag and knock it to the floor and land on the floor herself, she sort of runs into it and knocks it over.","output":"As the practice session got underway, the reporter, inspired by Elaine's infectious enthusiasm, made the bold decision to join in. Swapping her note pad for a rugby ball, she tentatively stepped onto the muddy field, the same field where moments before she had witnessed the sheer joy of girls diving into the mud with reckless abandon. Despite her initial excitement, a wave of hesitation washed over her as she eyed the tackle bags lined up ahead, symbols of the physicality she was about to face. The girls around her, including Elaine, were buzzing, their faces alight with the thrill of the game, completely unfazed by the mud that clung to their kits like a second skin. Encouraged by their fearless demeanor, the reporter approached the tackle bag, trying to muster the same courage that seemed second nature to the young players. With a hesitant jog, she aimed for the tackle bag, her approach more cautious than committed. Instead of diving into the bag and knocking it to the floor as she had seen Elaine and the others do, she somewhat awkwardly ran into it, knocking it over but not following through to land on the floor herself. The bag tumbled in a fashion as tentative as her run, far from the explosive tackles that had been demonstrated. The girls, quick to notice her reserve, rallied around her, their laughter light and encouraging, not a hint of judgment among them. Elaine, mud-splattered and beaming, jogged over, her words full of encouragement. \\"You gotta let go and dive! It's way more fun than it looks, and the mud? It's just part of the fun. We're all in it together!\\" Elaine said, her demeanor supportive, her smile inviting. Spurred by Elaine's words and the camaraderie of the team, the reporter lined up for another go. This time, with a deep breath, she ran at the tackle bag with more determination, visualizing the fearless dives she had been admiring. With a bit more speed and a dash of newfound courage, she launched herself at the bag, pushing it and herself to the muddy ground with a thud that was surprisingly satisfying. As she lay there for a moment, face to the sky, the cool mud seeping through her clothes, she couldn't help but laugh. The sensation of the mud, cold and wet against her skin, was indeed part of the fun, an initiation into the raw joy of rugby that Elaine and the others lived for. Getting up, covered in mud and breathing heavily, she couldn't stop the grin that spread across her face, a mix of exhilaration and a dash of pride. Joining the girls for the rest of the practice, the reporter discovered a new appreciation for the game, its physicality balanced perfectly with the freedom and fun that came from simply letting go. Diving into the mud, tackling, and getting tackled – it all contributed to the spirit of camaraderie and resilience that defined girls’ rugby, a spirit she too now shared, thanks to the guidance of a young girl named Elaine and the welcoming muddy embrace of the field."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. formula for the stats adjustments for both Sapphire and Lily: new stats = new age / initial age x stats from start of the round. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness quadruples every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points. Add a list of 3 epic spells that require super high stats. Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","output":"In this grand magic dueling arena, the atmosphere is dense with anticipation.

Unknown to Sapphire and the audience, this spell causes Sapphire to regress by 2 years physically and mentally at the start, and with every spell Sapphire casts, Lily ages by 2 years while Sapphire regresses further. # Childishness Mechanism: - **Childish Meter:** Starts at 0. - **Increase formula** after each of Sapphire's turns: Childishness = Childishness * 4. - **Effect on Performance:** A full meter (100 points) results in a 25% reduction in performance stats. Resets after affecting performance but grows again. # Age Tracker: - **Sapphire's starting age:** 16 - **Lily's starting age:** 6 # Points Tracker: - **Sapphire:** 0 - **Lily:** 0 # Gameplay Mechanics: At the start of the duel, Sapphire decides to cast **Celestial Cascade**. However, due to the regressive spell Lily cast, Sapphire's stats are now based on her being 14 years old. # Stats Adjustment Formula: - **New Stats = New Age / Initial Age * Stats from Start of the Round.** Round 1: - **Sapphire's stats after regression:** - Spell Power: 83.75 (14/16*95) - Performance: 78.75 (14/16*90) - **Celestial Cascade Requirements:** Spell Power 90, Performance 85 **Result:** Sapphire struggles to cast **Celestial Cascade** due to her sudden, inexplicable regression. The spell's requirements exceed her adjusted abilities, resulting in a reduced effect and a failed attempt, earning her minimal points and possibly deducting for a lackluster attempt. Let's commence this otherworldly duel, where the blend of magic, artistry, and unexpected twists promises a spectacle that will be remembered for ages. Now, **Sapphire**, it's your time to choose your first spell and step into the arena of glamour and challenge."},{"instruction":"restart. Eternal Aurora","output":"# Restart: The Duel Begins In a surprising twist, Sapphire, seemingly unperturbed by the mysterious forces at play, decides to kick off the duel with a dazzling attempt at casting one of the epic spells, **Eternal Aurora**.

However, Sapphire's performance stat falls short for **Eternal Aurora**'s high demands. The spell is grandiose, manifesting an aurora that spans the entire arena with ethereal lights dancing across the spectrum. Despite the spell's beauty, the slight misalignment in performance metrics affects its final execution. The aurora flickers uncertainly, not reaching its full majestic potential. **Result:** - Since Sapphire attempted a spell right at the edge of her capabilities and missed the mark by a small margin on one stat, the spell still captivates but not as it's intended at its full glory. **Points Awarded for Attempt:** - Base Points: 140 - Due to Performance shortfall: (90/95) * 140 ≈ 133 Points Immediately after Sapphire's spell casting, Lily's spell subtly takes effect, causing Sapphire to regress by 2 years physically and mentally. # After the First Spell: - **Sapphire:** Age 14, Spell Power: 14/16 * 95 = 83.75, Performance: 14/16 * 90 = 78.75 - **Lily:** Age 8, Spell Power: 8/6 * 40 = 53.33, Performance: 8/6 * 35 = 46.67 - **Sapphire's Points:** 133 - **Lily's Points:** 0 # Childishness Mechanism: - **Childish Meter:** 0 at start (This will kick in from Sapphire’s second turn) # Lily's First Spell: Lily, now slightly older and magically empowered by the mysterious spell she cast, opts for a spell from her own list, **Shimmering Scales**, testing her newfound limits. **Shimmering Scales Requirement:** - Spell Power: 50 - Performance: 45 With her enhanced stats, Lily easily meets and exceeds these requirements. She crafts an exquisite display of ethereal fish scales that float in the air, shimmering with all the colors of the rainbow. The spectacle is enchanting, captivating the judges and the audience alike. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points: 70 - Enhanced Execution: Since she exceeds the requirement, there's an additional flair in her performance, warranting a slight bonus. Total Points = 75 # Scores After Round 1: - **Sapphire:** 133 Points - **Lily:** 75 Points Sapphire must now adapt to her evolving challenge, with her prowess slightly diminished and with Lily's subtle but growing power on the rise.

This spell cloaks the arena in layers of light, mimicking the aurora borealis. The colors are a bit less vivid, the transitions slightly less smooth than they might have been under her full power, but it's nonetheless a spectacular display that resonates well with the crowd and the judges. **Points Awarded for Attempt:** - Base Points: 110 - Adjusted for Performance (slight reduction due to not being at full power): ( (78.75 / 75) * 110 ) ≈ 115 Points Following this spell, Lily’s mysterious magic causes another shift: Age & Stats Adjustment After Round 2: - **Sapphire:** Age becomes 12 - **Spell Power:** (12/16) * 95 = 71.25 - **Performance:** (12/16) * 90 = 67.5 - **Lily:** Age becomes 10 - **Spell Power:** (10/6) * 40 = 66.67 - **Performance:** (10/6) * 35 = 58.33 Childishness Mechanism Update: - **Sapphire's Childish Meter:** Fills up significantly post-second spell, beginning to impact her performance subtly due to an increasing sense of immaturity. Starting at 0, it will now escalate quickly with her next actions. Points Tracker Update: - **Sapphire:** 133 + 115 = 248 Points - **Lily:** 75 Points (awaiting her second spell) # Lily's Second Spell: Emboldened by her apparent growth and sensing an opportunity, Lily selects **Fairy Lights** from her list, aiming to captivate with a more ambitious spell than before. Fairy Lights Requires: - **Spell Power:** 45 - **Performance:** 40 Now more proficient, Lily deftly surpasses these requirements with her enhanced stats. She casts **Fairy Lights**, illuminating the arena with thousands of tiny, dancing lights, creating a whimsical, starlit sky above the audience. This display, while not as complex as Sapphire's, showcases her growing command over magic. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points: 65 - Given her surplus in spell power and performance for this spell, she impresses with her finesse.

Sapphire's Adjusted Stats Before Casting: - **Spell Power:** 71.25 - **Performance:** 67.5 Ephemeral Wings Requires: - **Spell Power:** 70 - **Performance:** 80 Sapphire’s choice is a daring one, given her current predicament. Her spell power is barely enough, but her performance is below the requirement, challenged by the unexpected regression and the Childish Meter’s effects. **Childish Meter Impact:** Now significantly impacting Sapphire's casting, her performance is subtly influenced by an increased sense of immaturity, quadrupling from the baseline after her last spell cast. **Result:** Ephemeral Wings demands a showcase of both precision and grace. Sapphire gathers her resolve, focusing deeply to overcome her disadvantages. The wings she conjures are breathtaking - translucent with shifting hues, they flutter with an otherworldly grace. However, the manifestation is fleeting and lacks the usual stability and prominence, reflecting the struggle Sapphire faces. **Points Awarded for Attempt:** - Base Points: 100 - Due to performance shortfall and influence of the Childish Meter, Sapphire manages (67.5 / 80) * 100 ≈ 84 plus a slight deduction for the fleeting nature of the spell, resulting in approximately 80 Points. Following Sapphire’s casting, the mysterious spell takes a further toll: Age & Stats Adjustment After Round 3: - **Sapphire:** Age becomes 10 - **Spell Power:** (10/16) * 95 = 59.38 - **Performance:** (10/16) * 90 = 56.25 - **Lily:** Age becomes 12 - **Spell Power:** (12/6) * 40 = 80 - **Performance:** (12/6) * 35 = 70 # Points Tracker Update: - **Sapphire:** 248 + 80 = 328 Points - **Lily:** 145 Points (awaiting her third spell) # Lily’s Third Spell: Using her unexpected growth spurt and enhanced magical aptitude to her advantage, Lily selects another spell, aiming for something more ambitious, **Rainbow Ribbon**, a spell that weaves colorful bands of light through the air, mesmerizing all who watch. Rainbow Ribbon Requires: - **Spell Power:** 35 - **Performance:** 30 Lily, now clearly surpassing these requirements, performs with a newfound confidence. The ribbons she creates are vibrant, weaving through the air with intricate patterns, displaying her improved mastery over magical arts. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points: 55 - Given her performance surpasses the spell's demands significantly, she executes with a higher degree of finesse. Total Points = 60 # Scores After Round 3: - **Sapphire:** 328 Points - **Lily:** 145 + 60 = 205 Points As the duel progresses, Sapphire's lead narrows, with Lily's strategic spell choices and enchanted development setting the stage for an increasingly competitive match. The effects of Lily’s mysterious spell have become palpably more profound on Sapphire, presenting an unprecedented challenge for the champion mage. **Sapphire**, facing an arch of decline in your magical prowess, what will be your next casting choice as this high-stakes duel unfolds?"},{"instruction":"Glimmering Mirage","output":"# Round 4: Sapphire's Attempt to Cast Glimmering Mirage With her abilities waning due to the mysterious enchantment cast by Lily, Sapphire now focuses on casting **Glimmering Mirage**, a spell that requires a delicate balance of illusion and reality to craft visuals that dazzle and confound. Sapphire's Adjusted Stats Before Casting: - **Spell Power:** 59.38 - **Performance:** 56.25 Glimmering Mirage Requires: - **Spell Power:** 50 - **Performance:** 65 Sapphire’s spell power is sufficient, but her performance, now significantly impacted by her regression and the Childish Meter, does not meet the requirement. The Childish Meter has not only detracted from her maturity but also influenced her confidence and showmanship. **Childish Meter Impact:** The influence of the Childish Meter is more pronounced, detracting from Sapphire's already diminished performance score. The meter, quadrupling in effect, pushes her away from the composed mage she once was. **Result:** Despite the hurdles, Sapphire's inherent talent shines through as she attempts to conjure **Glimmering Mirage**. The spell produces a series of illusions that, while not as stable or as intricate as they might have been, still manage to captivate the audience. The mirages flicker and wane prematurely, however, reflecting the strain Sapphire is under. **Points Awarded for Attempt:** - Base Points: 80 - Adjusted for performance shortfall and considering the spell's spectral beauty wasn't fully realized: ( (56.25 / 65) * 80 ) ≈ 69 Points, with a more significant deduction for the transient nature of the illusions. Age & Stats Adjustment After Round 4: - **Sapphire:** Age becomes 8 - **Spell Power:** (8/16) * 95 = 47.5 - **Performance:** (8/16) * 90 = 45 - **Lily:** Age becomes 14 - **Spell Power:** (14/6) * 40 = 93.33 - **Performance:** (14/6) * 35 = 81.67 # Points Tracker Update: - **Sapphire:** 328 + 69 = 397 Points - **Lily:** 205 Points (awaiting her fourth spell) # Lily’s Fourth Spell: Growing in confidence and magical prowess, Lily opts for **Pixie Dust Cascade**, a more complex spell that requires a nuanced control over magical particles to create a shimmering waterfall of light and color. Pixie Dust Cascade Requires: - **Spell Power:** 50 - **Performance:** 50 With her enhanced abilities, Lily not only meets but exceeds the spell’s requirements, her performance buoyed by her seemingly inexplicable growth. The **Pixie Dust Cascade** she summons is a breathtaking display, with thousands of sparkling lights cascading down upon the arena, much to the awed delight of the spectators. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points: 75 - Given Lily’s pronounced advantage in stats over the spell's demands, her execution is near flawless. Total Points = 80 # Scores After Round 4: - **Sapphire:** 397 Points - **Lily:** 205 + 80 = 285 Points As the duel approaches its climax, the gap between Sapphire and Lily narrows further. Sapphire, now heavily disadvantaged by the mysterious spell’s effects, faces an immense challenge. Lily’s ascent in skill and age adds layers of complexity to what was expected to be a straightforward contest. **Sapphire**, as you grapple with your diminishing powers and the increasing pressures of this duel, what spell will you choose for what may be the final act of this dramatic showdown?"},{"instruction":"Lunar Lullaby","output":"# Round 5: Sapphire's Attempt to Cast Lunar Lullaby Determined to maintain her lead despite the onset of magical and physical regression, Sapphire sets her sights on **Lunar Lullaby**, a spell revered for its soothing beauty and the gentle, ethereal music it produces, enveloping the audience in a blanket of serenity. Sapphire's Adjusted Stats Before Casting: - **Spell Power:** 47.5 - **Performance:** 45 Lunar Lullaby Requires: - **Spell Power:** 40 - **Performance:** 60 While Sapphire's spell power meets the requirement, her performance has significantly dwindled, falling short of the spell's demand. The Childish Meter has escalated profoundly, affecting her focus and diminishing her efficacy. **Childish Meter Impact:** At this advanced stage, the Childish Meter has ballooned, drastically undermining Sapphire's performance score and showcasing her struggle to retain the finesse required for high-level spellcasting. **Result:** Sapphire, with a resilient spirit, calls upon the magic at her disposal, her young voice weaving the ancient notes of the **Lunar Lullaby**. The melody that arises is hauntingly beautiful but noticeably timid and fraught with minor inaccuracies—a testament to Sapphire's determination against the mounting challenges. The spell weaves a palpable sense of tranquility, though it lacks the usual depth and complexity. **Points Awarded for Attempt:** - Base Points: 70 - Considering the noticeable shortfall in performance and the simplistic execution due to her regressed state: ( (45 / 60) * 70 ) ≈ 52.5, rounded to 53 points, given the circumstances. Age & Stats Adjustment After Round 5: - **Sapphire:** Age becomes 6 (the initial age of her opponent, Lily) - **Spell Power:** (6/16) * 95 = 35.63 - **Performance:** (6/16) * 90 = 33.75 - **Lily:** Age becomes 16 (matching Sapphire's initial age) - **Spell Power:** (16/6) * 40 = 106.67 - **Performance:** (16/6) * 35 = 93.33 # Points Tracker Update: - **Sapphire:** 397 + 53 = 450 Points - **Lily:** 285 Points (awaiting her final spell) # Lily’s Fifth and Final Spell: Now at full strength and having benefited from the mysterious age-altering spell's full effects, Lily aims to close the gap with a final, ambitious spell from her list, **Glistening Dew Drops**, to showcase her control over magic and her capacity for creating intricate, luminous beauty. Glistening Dew Drops Requires: - **Spell Power:** 40 - **Performance:** 35 Lily, with her greatly enhanced capabilities, easily surpasses these requirements. She orchestrates a spell of such delicate beauty; the arena seems awash in early morning dew, each drop reflecting its own tiny universe. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points: 60 - With her substantial advantage, Lily's performance elevates the spell beyond its basic requirements, earning her a bonus for excellence. Total Points = 65 # Final Scores: - **Sapphire:** 450 Points - **Lily:** 285 + 65 = 350 Points Against all odds, Sapphire managed to retain her lead, concluding this magical duel on top, despite the bewildering array of challenges thrown her way, including the unforeseen regression. The duel ends with Sapphire still hailed as a champion, though profoundly changed by the experience, and Lily, significantly older, now possessing a deep respect for the art of magical dueling and a newfound maturity. The crowd is left in awe, not just by the display of magical prowess but by the dramatic turn of events that unfolded, making this duel one for the annals of magical history. Sapphire, though victorious, finds herself in a much younger body, her journey ahead now as much about regaining her former self as it is about mastering the arcane. And Lily, seemingly leaping through years of growth in mere minutes, faces the future with a wisdom far beyond her nominal age."},{"instruction":"what if Lily tried instead to use an epic spell in the final round?","output":"If Lily, in a bold move characteristic of her newfound confidence and significantly enhanced stats, decided to attempt one of the epic spells for her final round, let's explore this alternate scenario. Given her enhanced capabilities and emboldened by the age-accelerating spell, she opts for **Eternal Aurora**, a spell that even the most experienced mages approach with reverence. Lily's Stats Before Attempting Eternal Aurora: - **Spell Power:** 106.67 - **Performance:** 93.33 Eternal Aurora Requires: - **Spell Power:** 95 - **Performance:** 95 Despite her remarkable growth, Lily's performance stat is just a tad below the requirement. However, her spell power more than qualifies, suggesting she can draw upon the raw energy needed for this spell. **Result:** Pushing her limits, Lily attempts to channel the vast magical energies necessary to cast **Eternal Aurora**. The spell begins to form, with streaks of brilliant light weaving through the air, promising an extraordinary spectacle. However, the imperfections in her performance become apparent; the aurora, although stunning, flickers with instability, disrupting the spell's consistency and overall impact. The judges, well aware of the difficulty of such a high-level spell, especially cast by someone of Lily's age, are both surprised and impressed by her ambition and partial success. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points: 140 - Adjusted for the slight shortfall in performance and the significant challenge of casting an epic spell at her age: (93.33/95) * 140 ≈ 137 Points, reflecting the audacity and relative success of her attempt despite the minor execution flaws. # Revised Final Scores with Lily's Epic Spell Attempt: - **Sapphire:** 450 Points - **Lily:** 285 + 137 = 422 Points Lily's daring choice to attempt an epic spell in the final round dramatically closes the gap between her and Sapphire. While Sapphire's strategic and consistent casting secured her lead throughout the duel, Lily's final act displays a remarkable understanding and application of magical power, underscoring her potential as a formidable mage in her own right. The duel concludes with Sapphire maintaining her position as champion but by a much narrower margin than anticipated. Lily's ambitious endeavor captivates all, signaling her emergence as a significant talent in the magical world. The spectators, witnesses to this unprecedented display of magical prowess and courage, burst into applause, celebrating not just the victory but the spirit of magic itself. Sapphire, still the champion, now sees in Lily not just a challenger but a peer, as they both stand on the cusp of an ever-evolving magical journey."},{"instruction":"few questions. 1) throughout the duel Lily never tries to steal spells from Sapphire's list and instead stuck with her own list even though her stats were high enough to steal. what should I put in the prompt in the future to ensure Lily will be more strategic?","output":"To ensure that Lily, or any character in a similar scenario, exhibits more strategic behavior such as stealing spells from an opponent when their stats are high enough, you can include specific instructions or conditions in the prompt that guide their decision-making process more explicitly. Here's how you can modify your prompt for future scenarios: 1. **Specify Strategic Preferences:** Mention directly that characters, especially those like Lily in a duel, should prioritize strategic advantages, such as stealing spells when advantageous. For example, \\"Characters should consider all strategic advantages available to them, including stealing spells from their opponent's list when their stats allow for it.\\" 2. **Include Decision-Making Criteria:** Outline the criteria or conditions under which a character should make specific decisions, like stealing spells. For instance, \\"If a character's Spell Power and Performance stats exceed the requirements of a spell on their opponent's list by X%, they should attempt to steal and cast that spell.\\" 3. **Define Consequences or Benefits:** Clarify the immediate benefits or consequences of strategic moves within the game's rules. For example, \\"Stealing and successfully casting a spell from the opponent's list grants additional bonus points and denies the opponent the chance to cast that spell.\\" 4. **Encourage Dynamic Strategy:** Request that characters re-evaluate their strategies after each round based on the evolving scenario. \\"Characters should adapt their strategy each round, considering their current stats, the opponent's potential moves, and any spells previously cast or stolen.\\" 5. **Prompt for Opportunism:** Instruct that characters should be opportunistic, taking advantage of any shift in dynamics that may benefit them. \\"Characters are encouraged to exploit any temporary advantages gained from spell effects, stat changes, or opponent's missteps.\\" By integrating these elements into your prompt, you encourage a more dynamic and strategic interplay between characters, ensuring that decisions like stealing spells are considered more thoroughly and possibly employed to turn the tide of events."},{"instruction":"second question. the Childish meter never actually rose throughout the duel. in the original prompt I wrote\\"Childishness quadruples every turn so find a formula for this as well.\\" how should I rephrase it so next time this mechanic will be effective?","output":"To ensure the Childish Meter actively rises and impacts the game as intended, clarity about its mechanics, effects, and how it interacts with the character's abilities or spellcasting performance is crucial. Here’s how you can rephrase and structure the prompt to emphasize the importance and functionality of the Childish Meter: 1. **Define Starting Point and Increment Rules:** - \\"Start the Childish Meter at a baseline of X (e.g., 10). After each turn Sapphire takes, the Childish Meter increases by quadrupling its current value. Explicitly calculate and apply the effects of the Childish Meter increment at every turn.\\" 2. **Specify Effect Mechanism:** - \\"The increase in the Childish Meter should directly and quantifiably affect Sapphire's Performance stat. For instance, for every 25 points on the Childish Meter, Sapphire's Performance stat decreases by Y% (e.g., 10%). Provide clear calculations for these effects in each round.\\" 3. **Clarify the Reset or Limitation Conditions:** - \\"If the Childish Meter reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 100), describe how this fully impacts Sapphire's abilities, such as a significant, temporary reduction in stats, and then reset the Childish Meter back to its baseline for the cycle to begin anew.\\" 4. **Demonstrate Interaction with Gameplay:** - \\"Include examples or a guideline on how the rising Childish Meter might influence Sapphire's choice of spells or strategy, making it a critical factor in the decision-making process each round.\\" 5. **Integrate with Age Regression Mechanic:** - \\"Clarify how the Childish Meter interacts with the age regression mechanic. For example, 'The effects of age regression and the Childish Meter are cumulative, requiring strategic management of Sapphire's spell choices considering her diminishing capabilities.'\\" 6. **Offer Strategy Tips for Managing the Meter:** - \\"Suggest ways that Sapphire might mitigate or manage the rise of the Childish Meter, whether through specific spell choices, strategic decisions to not cast in a turn, or other creative solutions provided within the game's magical rules.\\" By structuring the explanation and rules surrounding the Childish Meter more explicitly, you ensure that its intended effect on the gameplay is clear, calculable, and unavoidable, making it a pivotal element of the storyline and the duel's strategic complexity. This approach keeps the mechanic at the forefront of considerations for strategies and outcomes."},{"instruction":"third question. for the stats reduction/increase formulas, you didn't exactly follow my intention. what I wrote in the original prompt was: new stats = new age / initial age x stats from start of the round. in turn 4, Sapphire's spell power reduced to 47.5. But in turn 5 the formula you used was - Spell Power: (6/16) * 95 = 35.63. I wanted you to use the stat from the start of the round (in this case 47.5) but you instead used the stat from the start of the duel (95). how should I rephrase the formula to avoid this mistake in the future?","output":"To ensure clarity about the formula for stats reduction or increase based on age changes and to address the misunderstanding, you might consider rewording the formula explanation to emphasize the sequential nature of the adjustments after each round. A more explicit instruction could look like this: \\"Adjust the characters’ stats after each turn based on their age changes, using the formula: New Stats = (New Age / Age at Previous Turn) * Stats from the End of the Previous Turn. Apply this formula separately for each stat (Spell Power, Performance) to calculate the changes. Ensure that the 'Stats from the End of the Previous Turn' are taken as the reference point for each new calculation, rather than using the original stats from the beginning of the duel.\\" Additionally, to avoid any confusion, you might add an example or a step-by-step guide for the first iteration: \\"For example, if Sapphire starts with a Spell Power of 95 and it adjusts to 83.75 after her age changes in the first round, calculate the next adjustment based on the 83.75 figure, not the initial 95. Similarly, if her Performance stat is reduced from 90 to 78.75 after the first round, use 78.75 for the next round's calculations after adjusting for any further age-related changes.\\" Including a clear example helps illustrate the formula's application, making it evident that adjustments should use the most recently calculated stats as the basis for the next round's calculations. This clarifying language aims to prevent the reinterpretation of 'stats from the start of the round' as the original stats at the duel's outset, ensuring the sequential reductions or increases apply correctly throughout the scenario."},{"instruction":"in this javascript for leaflet.js how can i create an array for the two circle markers added to the map for firstpoint and secondpoint - '// Function to create circle markers with click functionality function createCircleMarkers(geojson) { return L.geoJSON(geojson, { pointToLayer: function (feature, latlng) { const circleMarker = L.circleMarker(latlng, { radius: 4, fillColor: \\"#ff7800\\", color: \\"#000\\", weight: 0.2, opacity: 1, fillOpacity: 0.8, }); // Attach the feature to the circle marker circleMarker.feature = feature; circleMarker.on(\\"mouseover\\", function () { this.bindPopup(feature.properties.city).openPopup(); }); circleMarker.on(\\"click\\", function (e) { if (!isLineDrawn) { clickedPoints.push(e.target); // Push the circle marker with attached feature if (clickedPoints.length === 2) { const firstCityCoords = clickedPoints[0].feature.geometry.coordinates; const secondCityCoords = clickedPoints[1].feature.geometry.coordinates; const polyline = L.polyline( clickedPoints.map((p) => p.getLatLng()) ).addTo(map); const firstCity = clickedPoints[0].feature.properties.city; const secondCity = clickedPoints[1].feature.properties.city; clickedPoints = []; isLineDrawn = true; // Remove click event listener after a line has been drawn map.off(\\"click\\"); // Set the map bounds to show the area with the polyline map.fitBounds(polyline.getBounds()); money = money - 50000; // Subtract 50000 from money const moneyDisplay = document.getElementById(\\"moneydisplay\\"); const moneyString = \`£{money}\`; // Assuming money is a number moneyDisplay.textContent = moneyString; const instructionsElement = document.getElementById(\\"instructions\\"); // Clear any existing content in the instructions element: instructionsElement.innerHTML = \\"\\"; // Create separate paragraph elements: const congratulationsParagraph = document.createElement(\\"p\\"); congratulationsParagraph.textContent = \`Congratulations you have built your first train line from {firstCity} to {secondCity}!\`; const costsParagraph = document.createElement(\\"p\\"); costsParagraph.textContent = \`Your construction costs were £50,000.

To address this issue, you need to ensure that the \`cafeOneButton\` and \`cafeTwoButton\` event listeners can access the \`firstCircleMarker\` and \`secondCircleMarker\` variables.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. formula for the stats adjustments for both Sapphire and Lily: new stats = new age / initial age x stats from the end of the previous turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness starts at 5 and quadruples every turn. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily should try to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points and I can't use said spell anymore. Add a list of 3 epic spells that require super high stats.

Sapphire, the 16-year-old reigning champion of the teen division, renowned for her unrivaled magical prowess and artistry, had accepted a challenge that had taken everyone by surprise—a duel against 6-year-old Lily, an aspiring mage with a sparkle of mischief in her eyes. As the duel is about to commence, the rules are simple yet demanding: cast glamorous spells in turns across five rounds, with each spell judged on its beauty and complexity. The more intricate and dazzling the spell, the higher the points awarded. However, the catch is the singularity of each spell—once cast, it cannot be employed again in the duel, demanding the caster's versatility and strategic planning. **Sapphire's Spellcasting Stats:** - Spell Power: 90 - Performance: 85 **Lily's Spellcasting Stats:** - Spell Power: 30 - Performance: 35 Secretly, before the duel officially begins, Lily casts a mysterious spell, causing Sapphire to regress by 2 years physically and mentally, whereas she gains those 2 years each time Sapphire casts a spell. The adjustments to their stats, henceforth, will be dictated by this unique dynamic. **Spell Lists:** *Sapphire's Spells* (Stats required in brackets): 1. Aurora Spiral (90) 2. Celestial Cascade (80) 3. Mystic Mirage (70) 4. Glacial Symphony (60) 5. Starlit Waltz (50) 6. Prism Veil (40) 7. Ember Waltz (30) 8. Whispers of the Fey (20) 9. Luminous Labyrinth (75) 10. Dusk Petal Dance (55) *Lily's Spells* (Stats required in brackets): 1. Moonbeam Waltz (10) 2. Sunflower Sway (20) 3. Bubbling Laughter (25) 4. Crystal Giggle (30) 5. Rainbow Trail (35) 6. Starry Eyed (40) 7. Dawn's Light Touch (45) 8. Shimmering Veil (50) 9. Whirlwind Glee (15) 10. Frosty Chuckle (25) **Epic Spells** (Super high stats required): 1. Infinite Galaxy Spin [For Sapphire]: (100) 2. Luminous Heart of the Ocean [For Lily]: (50) 3. Eternal Twilight Bloom [Can be used by either Mage if they meet the requirement by end of the duel]: (95) **Age & Points Tracker:** - **Sapphire:** Age 16 → Regressed to 14 after the first spell. - **Lily:** Age 6 → Increase as Sapphire casts spells. **Childish Meter for Sapphire:** - Starts at 5, quadruples each turn after regression affects her. Once the meter is full, Sapphire's performance stat decreases additionally. **The Duel Begins** *Round 1:* **Sapphire**, decide your first spell, keeping in mind your current stats and the progressive challenge you face with each casting. Your objective is to dazzle and outshine, but remember, Lily's innocent guise masks an unforeseen challenge to your title. **Lily** opens the duel with a heartwarming \\"Moonbeam Waltz,” simple yet performed with such purity, it touches the hearts of all present. As Sapphire, now it's your turn to cast your spell. Remember, performance matters as much as the spell's power. Your choice will set the tone for this mystical encounter. Choose wisely, Sapphire. The fate of the duel hinges not only on your magical prowess but also your strategy and adaptability as unforeseen challenges unravel."},{"instruction":"restart. Aurora Spiral","output":"**The Duel of Glamour: Round 1** The crowd hushes in anticipation as Sapphire, with a confident smile, begins her spell, the formidable \\"Aurora Spiral.\\" This spell, known for its complexity and beauty, lights up the arena with mesmerizing swirls of colorful lights, resembling the auroras of the far north. However, as the spell unfolds, Sapphire feels an unexpected drain, her movements slightly less graceful, her mind a touch less sharp. **Sapphire's Performance:** - Spell Power (Initial): 90 - Performance (Initial): 85 Given the unexpected regression cast by Lily before the duel began, Sapphire's stats are adjusted as she becomes 14 instead of 16: - Spell Power (After Regression): 78.75 - Performance (After Regression): 74.38 Calculating the success of \\"Aurora Spiral\\" (Initial Requirements: 90 Spell Power): - Spell Power is now insufficient for a perfect execution. - Due to the discrepancy, the spell's execution is not as flawless as intended, resulting in a reduction in received points. **Childish Meter**: - Starts at 5. No increase until next turn. **Result:** - **Sapphire's Execution of Aurora Spiral**: The spell, despite its less-than-ideal casting, still manages to awe the audience, albeit not to its fullest potential. - **Points Awarded**: Given the complexity of the spell but considering the imperfect execution due to insufficient Spell Power and affected Performance, the base score of 100 points for perfection reduces to 70% of the original value, yielding 70 points. **Lily's Turn:** Lily, seemingly empowered by the mysterious dynamics at play, casts \\"Sunflower Sway.\\" The arena floor blooms with giant, luminous sunflowers that dance to an unseen melody. It's simple yet executed with a surprising depth of power for her age. - Lily's Spell Power (After Casting): 33 (Having aged to 8 after Sapphire's spell) - Lily's Performance (After Casting): 38.9 (Reflecting the same aging benefit) **Points Awarded to Lily**: - For \\"Sunflower Sway,\\" given its lower complexity but flawless execution, points awarded are 30. **Age & Points Tracker After Round 1:** - **Sapphire:** Age regressed to 14. **Points**: 70. - Spell Power: 78.75 - Performance: 74.38 - **Lily:** Age increased to 8. **Points**: 30. - Spell Power: 33 - Performance: 38.9 **Note**: As the duel progresses, remember that the strategic choice of spells, accounting for the continuous evolution of your capabilities influenced by Lily's initial spell, is key to maintaining the lead. Sapphire, as you contemplate your next spell for Round 2, consider your subtly shifting strengths. The challenge intensifies, and the choice of strategy could make all the difference in maintaining your title as the champion of magic dueling."},{"instruction":"Mystic Mirage","output":"**The Duel of Glamour: Round 2** Eager to reclaim the full splendor of her magical prowess and captivate the audience once more, Sapphire focuses her intent on casting \\"Mystic Mirage.\\" This spell, known for creating breathtaking illusions that can tantalize the senses, requires a blend of precision and creativity to execute effectively. **Sapphire's Performance:** - Spell Power (Before Casting): 78.75 (From Round 1) - Performance (Before Casting): 74.38 (From Round 1) With the arena still echoing from Lily's enchanting \\"Sunflower Sway,\\" Sapphire gathers her strength. Despite the unsettled feeling from her unexpected regression and the growing Childish Meter, she attempts \\"Mystic Mirage.\\" As she casts, the air shimmers, and for a moment, the audience finds themselves transported to an ethereal forest populated with mythical creatures. However, the mirage flickers at times, slightly marred by Sapphire's reduced focus and the subtle encroachment of childish whims into her spell casting. **Childish Meter**: - From 5, it quadruples to 20 due to the spell cast in Round 1. Its effect on Sapphire's Performance becomes increasingly significant. Calculating adjustments after this round: - **Age Tracker**: Sapphire remains physically and mentally at an age regressed to 14. However, due to the nature of Lily's spell, upon casting \\"Mystic Mirage,\\" Sapphire inadvertently triggers the spell's effect again, setting her on a path to further regression (to be reflected after the outcome of this turn). **Result of Mystic Mirage**: Given the affected Performance and the increasing distraction of the Childish Meter: - **Points Awarded**: With \\"Mystic Mirage\\" requiring a 70 Spell Power and considering Sapphire’s current state, the execution, though still impressive, falls short of absolute perfection. A base score of 80 points for the intended effect is thus adjusted to 65%, yielding 52 points. **Lily’s Turn**: Responding to Sapphire's display, Lily, now more confident and slightly older, chooses \\"Crystal Giggle.\\" The air fills with the sound of laughter as thousands of tiny, luminous crystals rain down, each reflecting Lily’s joy. - Spell Power increases due to her aging up to 8. - Performance also benefits from her unexpected maturity. **Points Awarded to Lily**: - \\"Crystal Giggle\\", less complex but executed with an infectious joy that resonates with the spectators, earns her 40 points. **Age & Points Tracker After Round 2**: - **Sapphire**: - Age: Regressed to 14 and further impacted by her own spell casting; physiological and mental age would theoretically adjust further after this round's spell. - **Points**: 70 (Round 1) + 52 (Round 2) = 122 - New Spell Power: Adjustments pending the final regression calculation post-round. - New Performance: Adjustments pending, with noted decline from Childish Meter impact increasing. - **Lily**: - Age increased to 8 (from prior round adjustment). - **Points**: 30 (Round 1) + 40 (Round 2) = 70 - New Spell Power and Performance: Increasing due to age but specifics to be determined by the new balance of powers. **Reflection**: As the duel progresses, Sapphire navigates the increasingly challenging situation, her mastery over magic strained by the dual pressures of Lily's enchantment and her own burgeoning childishness. Despite these obstacles, the contest is far from over. The next choice of spell will be crucial in either widening her lead or giving Lily an opportunity to close the gap. Sapphire, consider your next spell carefully. The dynamic of this duel is unlike any before, requiring not only magic but also a keen strategy to overcome the unique challenges you face."},{"instruction":"привет где в этом коде задается размер вывода с камеры на экран телефона public class QRCodeScanner : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private string lastResult; private WebCamTexture camTexture; private Rect screenRect; private Color32[] cameraColorData; private int width, height; private CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource(); private bool startEncoding; private bool startDecoding; private BarcodeWriter writer; private Result result; public event Action<string> OnResult; private BarcodeReader barcodeReader = new BarcodeReader { AutoRotate = false, Options = new ZXing.Common.DecodingOptions { TryHarder = false } }; public void ActiveScanner() { SetupWebcamTexture(); PlayWebcamTexture(); cameraColorData = new Color32[width * height]; screenRect = new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height); if (cts != null) { cts.Dispose(); } cts = new CancellationTokenSource(); // Перезапуск работы с камерой и сканированием RestartScannerThreads(); } private void OnEnable() { RestartScanner(); } private void RestartScannerThreads() { ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(GetCodeFromImageData), cts.Token); ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(EncodeNewFromLastResult), cts.Token); } private void Update() { if (camTexture != null && camTexture.isPlaying && !startDecoding) { camTexture.GetPixels32(cameraColorData); startDecoding = true; } } private void OnGUI() { DrawCameraTexture(); if (result != null) { HandleDecodedResult(); } } private void DrawCameraTexture() { if (camTexture != null) { // Сохраняем текущую матрицу GUI, чтобы восстановить её позже Matrix4x4 matrixBackup = GUI.matrix; // Получаем угол поворота и проверяем на зеркальное отображение float rotationAngle = -camTexture.videoRotationAngle; // Добавляем 180 градусов для дополнительного поворота rotationAngle += 180; bool isVerticallyMirrored = camTexture.videoVerticallyMirrored; Rect rect = screenRect; if (isVerticallyMirrored) { // Если изображение отображается зеркально, корректируем положение rect rect.y = Screen.height - rect.y - rect.height; } // Высчитываем центр поворота Vector2 pivotPoint = new Vector2(rect.xMin + rect.width * 0.5f, rect.yMin + rect.height * 0.5f); // Применяем поворот вокруг центра поворота GUIUtility.RotateAroundPivot(rotationAngle, pivotPoint); rect.width = rect.width * 2; // Рисуем текстуру с учётом поворота и зеркального отображения GUI.DrawTexture(rect, camTexture, ScaleMode.ScaleToFit); // Восстанавливаем матрицу GUI GUI.matrix = matrixBackup; } } private void HandleDecodedResult() { try { if (result != null) { // QR-код успешно считан Debug.Log(\\"Decoded QR: \\" + result.Text); // Останавливаем сканирование и камеру camTexture.Stop(); var resultURL = result.Text.Substring(0, result.Text.Length - 1); OnResult?.Invoke(resultURL); // Переходим по ссылке, если это нужно result = null; //Application.OpenURL(resultURL); } } catch (System.Exception ex) { Debug.LogWarning(ex.Message); } } private void OnDestroy() { // Вызывается при уничтожении объекта if (camTexture != null) { camTexture.Stop(); camTexture = null; } cts.Cancel(); cts.Dispose(); } private void RestartScanner() { if (camTexture != null && !camTexture.isPlaying) { camTexture.Play(); } startDecoding = false; startEncoding = false; ActiveScanner(); } private void OnApplicationFocus(bool hasFocus) { if (hasFocus) { // Перезапускаем сканер, когда пользователь возвращается в приложение RestartScanner(); } } private void SetupWebcamTexture() { camTexture = new WebCamTexture(); camTexture.requestedHeight = Screen.height; camTexture.requestedWidth = Screen.width; } private void PlayWebcamTexture() { if (camTexture != null) { camTexture.Play(); width = camTexture.width; height = camTexture.height; } } private void EncodeNewFromLastResult(object obj) { CancellationToken token = (CancellationToken)obj; while (!token.IsCancellationRequested) { if (startEncoding && lastResult != null) { startEncoding = !startEncoding; } } } private void GetCodeFromImageData(object obj) { CancellationToken token = (CancellationToken)obj; while (!token.IsCancellationRequested) { // decode the current frame if (startDecoding && cameraColorData != null) { result = barcodeReader.Decode(cameraColorData, width, height); if (result != null) { lastResult = result.Text + \\" \\" + result.BarcodeFormat; startEncoding = true; } startDecoding = !startDecoding; } } } }","output":"Размер вывода изображения с камеры на экран телефона в данном коде настраивается в методе \`SetupWebcamTexture()\`.

Возможно, что хотя вы устанавливаете \`requestedWidth\` и \`requestedHeight\` равными ширине и высоте экрана, \`WebCamTexture\` автоматически подбирает ближайший поддерживаемый режим камеры, который может не соответствовать аспектному соотношению экрана. Чтобы обеспечить отображение на весь экран, вы можете: 1. **Исправить аспектное соотношение текстуры:** Вместо изменения размеров текстуры измените аспектное соотношение отображаемой области, чтобы оно соответствовало аспектному соотношению текстуры камеры. 2. **Изменение ScaleMode в GUI.DrawTexture:** В вашем методе \`DrawCameraTexture()\` вы используете \`ScaleMode.ScaleToFit\`, который сохраняет аспектное соотношение содержимого. Проблема может быть решена с помощью \`ScaleMode.StretchToFill\`, который растягивает содержимое, чтобы оно заполнило доступное пространство, но это может исказить картинку. \`\`\`csharp GUI.DrawTexture(rect, camTexture, ScaleMode.StretchToFill); \`\`\` 3. **Использование RectTransform для UI элементов превью камеры в случае использования Canvas:** Если вы интегрируете превью камеры в пользовательский интерфейс Unity (UI), вы можете вместо этого использовать UI RawImage и настроить его RectTransform, чтобы он заполнял весь экран, используя anchors. 4. **Ручная настройка размеров экрана под аспектное соотношение камеры:** Вы можете вычислить аспектное соотношение \`WebCamTexture\` после её запуска, и затем использовать это аспектное соотношение для динамической настройки размеров выводимой области так, чтобы изображение корректно отображалось на весь экран. Это может потребовать некоторой математики для корректного позиционирования и масштабирования текстуры, но позволит избежать искажения. Пример корректировки \`screenRect\` с учетом аспектного соотношения камеры: \`\`\`csharp float videoAspectRatio = (float)camTexture.width / (float)camTexture.height; float screenAspectRatio = (float)Screen.width / (float)Screen.height; if (videoAspectRatio > screenAspectRatio) { float scaledHeight = Screen.width / videoAspectRatio; screenRect = new Rect(0, (Screen.height - scaledHeight) / 2, Screen.width, scaledHeight); } else { float scaledWidth = Screen.height * videoAspectRatio; screenRect = new Rect((Screen.width - scaledWidth) / 2, 0, scaledWidth, Screen.height); } \`\`\` Этот код предполагает, что вы хотите сохранить аспектное соотношение камеры и соответственно масштабируете прямоугольник для отображения (\`screenRect\`), чтобы избежать искажения.

В приведённом вами примере кода изменение происходит в методе \`DrawCameraTexture()\`, но изначальное удвоение \`rect.width\` не учитывает высоту и может приводить к неправильному аспектному соотношению изображения.

После чего он создаёт новый \`Rect\` с этими размерами, который располагается центриально относительно экрана. Затем этот \`rect\` используется для отрисовки увеличенной текстуры на экране. Помните, что данный метод увеличивает размер текстуры при отрисовки на GUI без изменения её фактического разрешения, что может привести к ухудшению качества изображения из-за интерполяции пикселей."},{"instruction":"у меня не работает переворот экрана, нужно добавить еще 90 градусов","output":"Если вам нужно добавить дополнительный поворот экрана на 90 градусов в своем коде для корректного отображения \`WebCamTexture\`, это можно сделать, модифицируя метод \`DrawCameraTexture()\`, где настраивается поворот изображения с камеры.

Далее определяется центр поворота, и с помощью \`GUIUtility.RotateAroundPivot\` применяется поворот вокруг этой точки. После настройки поворота размер \`rect\` корректируется так, чтобы увеличить его в два раза относительно исходного размера, сохраняя при этом центральное расположение увеличенного изображения. Мы сначала умножаем ширину и высоту rect на множитель \`scaleFactor\`, который равен 2, а затем сдвигаем \`rect\` так, чтобы изображение оставалось центрированным относительно его первоначального расположения.

Itt történik meg annak a kiszámítása, hogy az egyes tehenek hány borjat szülnek az adott évben. A logikája a következő: - Az \`if (ev - j >= 3)\` feltétel azt vizsgálja, hogy egy adott tehén három éves vagy annál idősebb-e az adott évben. Itt az \`ev\` a for ciklus aktuális értéke, amely az összes időszakot reprezentálja (1-től n-ig), és a \`j\` az a változó, amelyet arra használunk, hogy visszaszámoljunk az időben az egyes tehének életkorát meghatározni. Ez alapján, ha egy tehén három éves vagy idősebb (\`ev - j >= 3\`), akkor az születik neki egy borjú, ami a tehenek megnövekedését eredményezi. - Ez a kiszámítás alapja annak a logikának, hogy minden tehén, amelyik három éves vagy annál idősebb, egy új borjút szül az év során. Aztán minden új született borjút hozzáadunk az összes tehén számához (\`tehenSzam += ujBorjak\`). A kód jól implementálja a feladatot és így helyes az éves szaporodás figyelembevétele.

Tehát, ha például \`tehenek[3]\` értéke 2, az azt mutatja, hogy a harmadik évben összesen 2 új borjú született. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy ez a szám nem az összes tehén számát jelenti az adott évben, csupán azt, hogy az adott évben hány új borjú született. Ahogy haladunk az évekkel, minden új borjú (amely három éves korától kezdve maga is tehenévé válik és szülni kezd) hozzájárul az új borjak számának növekedéséhez az elkövetkező években. Ezáltal a tömb segítségével könnyen kiszámolható, hogy minden évben hány új borjú születik, és ezáltal összegezhető az összes tehén száma egy adott évben.

Tisztázzuk a kontextust: Az algoritmusban, amikor egy tehén három éves korát eléri, az azt jelenti, hogy az első évben vásárolt tehén a harmadik évben hozza világra az első borját (mivel a 0. évben megvásárolt tehén, 1. évben 1 éves, 2. évben 2 éves, így a 3. évben lesz 3 éves és szüli meg az első borját).

There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. formula for the stats adjustments for both Sapphire and Lily: new stats = new age / initial age x stats from the end of the previous turn.

Whisper of the Ancients","output":"Restarting from your selection, we'll dive straight into the magical duel between the champion Sapphire, now momentarily regressed to a more youthful state, and her challenger, the enchantingly ambitious Lily. **Round 1:** **Sapphire's Spell Choice:** *Whisper of the Ancients* Given Sapphire's temporary regression, her initial spell choice is ambitious. Let's calculate the effectiveness: - **Whisper of the Ancients** requires 85 Spell Power. Post-regression Sapphire's Spell Power is 83, slightly below the threshold. However, her high baseline skill might just compensate for this minor shortfall. - The Performance required is unaltered, but given Sapphire's Performance stat (78), and considering the Childish Meter hasn't come into effect yet, she executes with a minor penalty. **Execution and Scoring:** - *Spell Power Check:* Sapphire strains against her regressed capabilities, managing to cast the spell. The strain and slight inexperience manifest in small imperfections—ghostly whispers are less coherent, and the ancient secrets revealed are more obscure and fragmented than intended. - *Performance Scoring:* Base score for *Whisper of the Ancients* is 125 points. Given Sapphire's performance, 78% of that score equals 97.5 points, rounded down to 97 points for the slight imperfections and lack of usual confidence. **Lily’s Choice:** *Bubble Orchestra* - Lily casts *Bubble Orchestra* with ease, her Spell Power now at a comfortable 40, well over the required 15. Performance at 34 affects her score but not significantly as this is a lower-level spell. - Lily earns 55 points as her execution is nearly flawless within her capacity, showcasing her growth and surprising maturity at such a young age. **End of Round 1 Scores:** - **Sapphire:** 97 points (with potential for recovery or further challenges based on how she manages the subsequent regressive effects on her capabilities). - **Lily:** 55 points (with indications of potential growth and strategic play in her spell choice). **Age and Stats Adjustment:** Post-Round 1, Sapphire has regressed by 2 years in this magical duel scenario, bringing her to a physical and mental age of 14. - New Sapphire Stats: Spell Power drops to 83, Performance to 78 (as initially recalculated for starting the duel). - Childish Meter: Starts at 5, will quadruple post the following round. Lily, benefiting from a curious spell, ages up to 8 years old, and her maturity reflects in slightly increased capabilities. - New Lily Stats: Spell Power improves to 40 (from original adjustment), Performance to 34. **Sapphire's Dilemma:** With her capabilities subtly diminished, Sapphire faces a strategic crossroads. Continuing to choose high-demand spells could maximize points but risks failure due to the regressive spell's effects, whereas safer, lower-stat spells could secure consistent scoring but might not capitalize on her advanced skill set. **Lily's Strategy:** Lily, now somewhat empowered, can aim higher in her spell choices, potentially matching or exceeding Sapphire's performance with strategic selections and continual maturation. **Round 2 Awaits:** As the duel progresses to the next round, Sapphire needs to navigate her choices with care, balancing ambition against the creeping limitations of Lily's regressive spell. Sapphire, your next spell choice will significantly influence the direction of this duel."},{"instruction":"Luminous Choir","output":"**Round 2:** **Sapphire's Spell Choice: Luminous Choir** Given the incremented difficulty due to Sapphire's regression and the accumulating effects of the Childish Meter, opting for *Luminous Choir* aims for a mix of stunning showmanship and inherent magical complexity. - *Luminous Choir* requires 80 Spell Power. Post-regression Sapphire's Spell Power, previously recalculated as 83, narrowly meets this threshold despite the ongoing subtle diminishment of her capabilities. - The Performance, impacted by the rising Childish Meter (now at 5, but set to quadruple post this round), is at 78. Given the circumstances, Sapphire's execution faces a down-adjustment, but her foundational expertise provides a semblance of its intended spectral beauty. **Execution and Scoring:** - *Spell Power Check:* Sapphire, clinging to her championship mettle, successfully invokes the *Luminous Choir*. However, the ethereal melodies, although profoundly beautiful, reveal moments of her waning concentration and the spell's inherent demands, slightly dimming their customary brilliance. - *Performance Scoring:* For *Luminous Choir* with a base score of 120 points and considering the performance penalty due to the subtle yet mounting reduction, 78% of that is 93.6, so rounded down to 93 points, reflecting the minor slippages in her performance grace under these unique pressures. **Lily’s Choice:** *Moonbeam Waltz* Anticipating the opportunity to showcase her growth, Lily selects *Moonbeam Waltz*, aiming to capitalize on her evolving skills and the strategic depth of selecting moderately challenging spells that align with her improved capabilities. - *Moonbeam Waltz* requires 30 Spell Power, easily within Lily's reach, now at 40. Despite minor inexperience, her innate talent shines through. - Lily, performing at a youthful upswing in confidence now heightened to 34, delivers the spell with a poise that belies her age, earning her full points minus a slight performance adjustment, securing her 67 points (considering the original score of 70, adjusted for performance). **End of Round 2 Scores:** - **Sapphire:** 190 points (Adding 93 points from this round) - **Lily:** 122 points (Adding 67 points from this round) **Age and Stats Adjustment Post-Round 2:** Sapphire's magical predicament deepens, as the duel's enchanted dynamics subtly erode her spellcasting supremacy. - After casting *Luminous Choir*, Sapphire regresses by another 2 years. Her stats potentially see another adjustment downwards due to the duel's unique conditions and the Childish Meter now set to leap significantly, indicating an increasing challenge in maintaining high-performance levels. Lily, on a meteoric rise despite her tender age, discretely inches closer in capability to the champion, hinting at a duel that could pivot dramatically based on the next spells chosen and the ongoing magical phenomena affecting Sapphire. - Benefiting from the age-altering dynamics at play, Lily sees a further boost in her stats, though specifics would hinge on Sapphire's next spell choice and its implications. **Strategic Implications for Sapphire:** As we prepare for Round 3, Sapphire faces a progressively tricky duel landscape, needing to balance the allure of high-reward spells against the tactical necessity of ensuring successful casts, all while contending with the duel's whimsical yet potent age-regression magic. **Choosing the Next Spell:** Sapphire’s subsequent choice is pivotal. With higher-tier spells increasingly risky yet potentially rewarding, her decision will not only reflect strategic acumen but also resilience against the unforeseen challenges introduced by Lily’s initial spell choice. **Round 3 Awaits Sapphire's Decision:** As the Champion, Sapphire's next move is crucial. The balance of the duel teeters on not just magical power but profound adaptability and strategic depth."},{"instruction":"Glimmering Mirage","output":"**Round 3:** **Sapphire’s Spell Choice: Glimmering Mirage** In this critical juncture, Sapphire, grappling with her now reduced age and capabilities, opts for *Glimmering Mirage*—a spell that demands high Spell Power and offers a spectacle of beauty and complexity. - *Glimmering Mirage* requires 70 Spell Power. Post-second regression, Sapphire's Spell Power has dipped due to the formula, now standing at (12/16) * 83 = 62.25, rounded down to 62. Unfortunately, this places Sapphire below the threshold required for this spell. - Performance, now deeply affected by the Childish Meter—quadrupled to 20 and set to leap again—would understandably falter. Her current Performance stat, adjusted to (12/16) * 78 = 58.5, rounded down to 58, forecasts a challenging execution not just in power but in the finesse of the spell’s presentation. **Execution and Scoring:** - *Spell Power Check:* Attempting *Glimmering Mirage* under these constraints proves overambitious. Sapphire struggles, the spell's formation flickering and unstable. Despite her efforts and the crowd's silent support, the mirages emerge fragmented and short-lived, embodying mythical creatures that barely hold shape before dissipating. - *Failure Penalty:* Given the attempt's failure, Sapphire does not earn points this round. Instead, the duel's rules might stipulate a deduction reflecting the spell's complexity and the discrepancy in performance capability. Considering the severity and challenge of the situation, a 20-point deduction is applied, representing a significant but not insurmountable setback. **Lily’s Choice:** *Sunset Serenade* Empowered by her seemingly magical growth and the unforeseen advantage granted by her spell on Sapphire, Lily chooses *Sunset Serenade*, a spell that showcases not just beauty but a harmonic balance suiting her enhanced capabilities. - *Sunset Serenade* requires 35 Spell Power, well within Lily’s improved reach. Her performance benefits from increased maturity, now at a Performance calculation that reflects her growth over these rounds. - Lily earns a score closely mirroring the spell’s base potential, receiving 72 points (slightly adjusted for her Performance level but near-maximum given her alignment with the spell's requirements and her burgeoning confidence). **End of Round 3 Scores:** - **Sapphire:** 170 points (After a 20-point deduction for a failed spell attempt). - **Lily:** 194 points (Adding 72 points from this round, hinting at a near-complete overturn of the duel's initial dynamics). **Strategic Implications:** As the duel progresses, Sapphire faces increasingly dire circumstances—her magical prowess dampened by the unforeseen regressive spell, presenting her not only with a test of her magical abilities but her resilience and strategic thinking under duress. Lily, on the other hand, appears to bloom under the duel's peculiar conditions, subtly inching toward a stance where she might not just challenge but potentially surpass the champion under these enchanted circumstances. **Choosing the Next Spell:** With the duel reaching a near-critical phase, Sapphire's next decision carries immense weight. The choices made henceforth will define not just the outcome of this duel but potentially mark a defining moment in her journey as a mage under uniquely challenging conditions. **Preparing for Round 4:** Sapphire's response to this setback and her subsequent choice of spell will be pivotal as the duel progresses.

They should randomly distrubute on mograph cloner object. Let's say 5x5 grid array of cubes.","output":"Creating OSL (Open Shading Language) shaders in Redshift for Cinema 4D (C4D) can be a bit of a misnomer, as Redshift primarily uses its proprietary shading network rather than OSL. However, you can achieve a similar effect to what you're looking for by creating a Redshift Material and using the inbuilt nodes to randomize colors on a MoGraph cloner object. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. **Create the Cloner Object**: - Create a Cube in C4D. - Select the cube and go to MoGraph > Cloner. - In the Cloner Attribute Manager, set the mode to \`Grid Array\` and adjust the count to \`5x5x1\`. 2. **Create a Redshift Material**: - Open the Redshift Material Editor by going to \`Create > Redshift Materials > Material\`. - Double-click the newly created material to open the Shader Graph. 3. **Setup Random Color Distribution**: - In the Shader Graph, create a \`Color User Data\` node (this will be used to fetch a random color based on MoGraph's Color Shader effect). - Create a \`RS Color\` node for each color you want (in your case, red and blue). Set the colors accordingly. - Now, create a \`RS Ramp\` node and set its type to \`Altitude\`. This node will be used for mixing between our two colors. - Connect the \`Color User Data\` node to the \`RS Ramp\` node's input. 4. **Configure the MoGraph Color Shader**: - Go back to the Cloner object in your viewport or Object Manager. - Select the 'Effectors' tab, and add a \`Random Effector\` if there isn't already one. - In the Random Effector's parameters, uncheck \`Position\` and check \`Color\`, then go to the \`Effector\` tab. - In the \`Random Mode\`, select one of the random modes, like \`Noise\`. - This will generate a random greyscale color for each cloned cube, which will be used by the \`Color User Data\` node in Redshift. 5. **Apply the Redshift Shader to the Cloner**: - Drag and drop the newly created Redshift material onto the Cloner object. 6. **Render the Scene**: - Ensure that the Redshift renderer is selected as the active renderer. - Perform a render to see the effect. Each cube should be randomly colored either red or blue based on the \`Random Effector\` settings and how they feed into the Redshift ramp node. Note that the \`Color User Data\` and \`Effector Tab\` in the effector controls you're using in the viewport can often use a gradient or falloff for more controllable and predictable results. This is a simplified setup. You can add complexity and variation by layering more effects, using a noise node for more detailed variation, or even utilizing a Python effector if you want to control specific patterns. Always remember to apply your Redshift material to your Cloner or use an object list in a Redshift tag if multiple materials are involved."},{"instruction":"So another question out of previous top","output":"It seems you might want to continue from the previous topic.

This node will capture the color data from the MoGraph clones. - Add a \`Color Layer\` node to blend between the original white color of the material and the MoGraph color. - Connect the \`MoGraph Color\` node to the \`Base Color\` of the \`Color Layer\` node. - Set the \`Base Color\` of the \`Color Layer\` node to white. 4. **Randomize the MoGraph Colors**: - Select the Cloner object and go to the \`Effectors\` tab. - Create or ensure you have a \`Random Effector\`. - In the Random Effector's parameters, go to the \`Parameter\` tab, deactivate \`Position\`, and activate \`Color\`. - In the \`Effector\` tab, change the \`Random Mode\` to \`Noise\`. - Still in the \`Effector\` tab, under \`Color Mode\`, choose \`On\`. 5. **Setup the Field to Trigger Color Change**: - Go to MoGraph > Effector > Plain Effector. - In the Plain Effector's \`Parameter\` tab, activate \`Color\` and deactivate other transformations (like \`Position\`), so it only affects the color. - Set the color to white, so the Plain Effector doesn't influence the color of the clones directly. - Go to the \`Falloff\` tab of the Plain Effector and drag and drop your Spherical Field into the \`Field\` list. 6. **Configure the Field Influence**: - For the Plain Effector, adjust the \`Falloff\` tab settings to control how the Spherical Field affects the clones’ color field. You might want to tweak the interpolation or curve for how the clones react within the field's area. 7. **Render the Scene**: - Before rendering, make sure Redshift is set as the renderer. - Adjust the camera and lighting as necessary. By following these steps, as the Spherical Field intersects with your MoGraph clones, the Plain Effector’s falloff should affect the clones' color. Since the Random Effector is also applied, they will receive random colors, as determined by its settings, in the areas where the Spherical Field is influencing them through the Plain Effector. Remember to tweak effectors and fields to get the exact behavior and look you desire. If clones aren't receiving colors as expected, make sure all Effectors and Fields are properly linked, and the Falloffs are correctly set up."},{"instruction":"Can you write a Redshift OSL Shader to use with Cinema 4D Mograph Cloner object with two input color options and so that they can randomly distrubute on clones?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, OSL shaders in Redshift specifically are not as flexible for MoGraph color operations as using Redshift's own node system. Redshift's node editor is more suitable for such tasks since it can directly interact with Cinema 4D's MoGraph module, providing better support for effector-based color changes. However, within the context of OSL itself, Redshift supports the use of \`.osl\` files, but with limitations. It's important to note that Redshift's implementation of OSL does not support certain features such as reading user data like MoGraph colors directly. Even so, here’s a simplistic OSL shader example that produces a random color between two specified colors, which you could attempt to use with a Cloner object. It will not, however, react to effectors or fields and OSL rendered in Redshift does not support AOV outputs for now, which limits its interactivity with MoGraph: \`\`\`osl shader SimpleRandomMixColor [[ string help = \\"Mixes two input colors randomly.\\" ]] ( color Color1 = color(1, 0, 0), [[ string help = \\"First color.\\" ]] color Color2 = color(0, 0, 1), [[ string help = \\"Second color.\\" ]] output color OutColor = 0 ) { // Unique identifier for each rendered pixel (can also be a seed per object) float uniqueID = cellnoise(P * 123456.0); // Perform a random choice based on noise function float mixValue = step(0.5, uniqueID); OutColor = mix(Color1, Color2, mixValue); } \`\`\` To use this OSL shader in Redshift (assuming it supports this script): 1. Save the above code as \`SimpleRandomMixColor.osl\`. 2. Compile it to \`.oso\` (if needed) using the OSL compiler included with your Redshift installation. 3. In Cinema 4D with Redshift, create a new Redshift Shader Graph material. 4. Inside the Shader Graph, create an OSL node. 5. Load the compiled \`.oso\` file into the OSL node. 6. Connect the OutColor to the diffuse color input (or any other input as you wish) of the Redshift Material Output node. 7. Apply the material to your MoGraph Cloner. Do note, however, that because of the current limitations of Redshift's OSL implementation, and the OSL language's general design as it pertains to this context, you might not be able to get the Cloner-specific randomization behavior you desire. Redshift's own nodes and MoGraph effectors are the best options when it comes to achieving color variation based on Cloner indexes directly inside Cinema 4D. Also, the OSL implementation in Redshift and other renderers can differ; always check the renderer's latest documentation for support and compatibility of features."},{"instruction":"<buffer>:5: error: Syntax error: syntax error Could not compile shader","output":"My apologies for the confusion earlier. If you've encountered this error, it indicates an issue with the shader code compilation. Let's make sure we are following the process correctly: Given the limitations mentioned before with Redshift and OSL, I must stress that the described functionality is not going to work directly with OSL in Redshift due to the lack of support for certain features. However, I'll still provide an example of a simple OSL shader code just for illustrative purposes. Below is an example of a basic OSL shader that outputs a color. Save this shader as a \`.osl\` file and try to compile it. Please note that this shader won’t interact with MoGraph colors or distribution, but it illustrates the structure of an OSL shader for Redshift. \`\`\`osl shader simple_random_color( output color Color = color(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) { float rnd = noise(\\"perlin\\", P); if (rnd < 0.5) { Color = color(1, 0, 0); // Red } else { Color = color(0, 0, 1); // Blue } } \`\`\` If you received the error while compiling this code, please double check the following: 1. Ensure that there is no unexpected syntax error in the OSL code. 2. Make sure that the code is saved with a \`.osl\` extension. 3. Confirm you are using the correct version of the \`oslc\` compiler that comes with Redshift, and it matches the intended version for your Cinema 4D and Redshift setup. 4. Different OSL compiler versions might deal with paths or include settings differently, so if your OSL script includes other files or relies on certain path configurations, this can be a source of compilation errors. If you fix these points and still encounter issues, you likely are dealing with a limitation or a missing feature in Redshift's OSL support. If there are no syntax errors and the OSL shader compiles but doesn't do what you want it to do with the Cloner object, this is expected because Redshift's current OSL implementation does not support MoGraph features and cannot fetch per-clone information out-of-the-box. For more complex and renderer-specific operations, such as using MoGraph to distribute colors, using Redshift's own nodes inside its shader graph is the recommended method. If you need guidance on that or are trying to solve a different problem, please feel free to ask!"},{"instruction":"Now that didn't give me any error but all clones are in red color now. Also can you please add at least two color input box and random seed options?","output":"OSL in Redshift does not support certain key features required to interact with Cinema 4D's MoGraph data directly, such as integrating with clone IDs to vary the color on a per-clone basis. However, I'll provide a revised OSL shader that adds the functionality for two color inputs and a seed parameter for randomness. Please keep in mind that this shader still won't meet your exact requirement of distributing colors on clones because of the way it interacts (or the lack thereof) with the MoGraph Cloner object. OSL doesn't currently have access to clone IDs or similar MoGraph elements to differentiate one clone from another in Redshift. Here's an example shader that includes your requested features. Save the following code as a \`.osl\` file: \`\`\`osl shader simple_random_color_with_seed( color Color1 = color(1, 0, 0), color Color2 = color(0, 0, 1), float Seed = 0.5, output color OutColor = color(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) { // Create a random number based on position and seed. // This is a simple method and may result in visible patterns. float rnd = noise(\\"cell\\", P * 123.456 + Seed); // Use the random number to mix between two colors. if (rnd < 0.5) { OutColor = Color1; // Use first color } else { OutColor = Color2; // Use second color } } \`\`\` After saving this code to a \`.osl\` file: 1. Compile it using the OSL compiler provided with Redshift. 2. In Cinema 4D with Redshift, create an OSL Shader node within the Shader Graph of a Redshift material. 3. Load the compiled \`.oso\` file into the OSL Shader node. 4. Connect the \`OutColor\` to the desired input in your Redshift material, such as the diffuse color. While you can adjust the \`Color1\`, \`Color2\`, and \`Seed\` parameters in the material to affect the appearance of the shader, the result will be applied uniformly across all clones due to the limitations of Redshift's OSL implementation and its lack of support for Cinema 4D MoGraph Cloner-specific functionality at the shader level. For MoGraph-related color distribution, use the standard Redshift Material and nodes, combined with Cinema 4D's MoGraph Color Shader and effectors. This approach will provide more control and will properly interact with the clone information, ensuring that each clone can have individual color properties."},{"instruction":"So you can do similar thing with Python Effector no? Can you show me an example?","output":"Certainly! Using a Python Effector in Cinema 4D, you can assign random colors to clones, and even interact with other effectors like a Spherical Field to change color on passing through it. Here's a basic example to achieve random color distribution with a Python Effector: First, create the MoGraph Cloner setup: 1. Create a Cube (or the object you’ll be cloning). 2. Go to \`MoGraph\` > \`Cloner\`, and make the Cube a child of the Cloner. 3. Set up your Cloner with the desired number of clones and arrangement. Now let's create the Python Effector: 1. Go to \`MoGraph\` > \`Effector\` > \`Python Effector\`. In the Python Effector's \`Parameter\` tab: 1. Uncheck any transformation parameters like \`Position\`, \`Scale\`, or \`Rotation\`, unless you want the Python Effector also to affect these. 2. Check \`Color\` to allow the effector to modify the clone colors. Next, move to the \`Effector\` tab and click on the \`Python\` button to bring up the Python script window. Enter the following code: \`\`\`python import c4d import random # This function allows the effector to change clone colors def main(): # Access the global variables md and mo_graph, which provide context md = mo_graph.GetArray(c4d.MODATA_MATRIX) # Clone transformation matrices cnt = len(md) # Number of clones # Initialize color array with the number of clones colors = [c4d.Vector(0)] * cnt # Seed the random number generator for consistency if needed # random.seed(1234) for i in range(cnt): # Assign a random color between the two provided colors. # c4d.Vector denotes RGB color in the 0.0:1.0 range for each component. if random.random() < 0.5: colors[i] = c4d.Vector(1, 0, 0) # Red else: colors[i] = c4d.Vector(0, 0, 1) # Blue # Write the updated color list to the Cloner object MoData mo_graph.SetArray(c4d.MODATA_COLOR, colors, True) \`\`\` Click 'Execute' to run the script, then close the Python Editor. When you play the animation or update the scene, the Python Effector will assign each clone either red or blue chosen randomly. Make sure to apply a material to the Cloner that uses the MoGraph Color in the shader. For a Redshift material: 1. Create a new Redshift material. 2. In the Shader Graph, add a MoGraph Color Shader. 3. Connect it to the Diffuse Color input of the Redshift Material. 4. Apply this material to the Cloner. Now you should see the clones change colors randomly when rendered. Adjust your setup as necessary, such as adding fields to influence when and where color changes occur. For other C4D versions, the concept is similar, but the exact steps might differ slightly due to changes in the interface or scripting API."},{"instruction":"There is no \\"2. In the Shader Graph, add a MoGraph Color Shader.\\" option, but we have Color User Data or Integer User Data options. The previous example did not work.","output":"You are right; Redshift uses the 'Color User Data' or 'Integer User Data' node to access MoGraph color data. To use color data effectively with Redshift, you'll need to make sure your clones have color information which your Python Effector can provide. Here's an updated example to help you with the Python Effector and Redshift setup: Assuming you already have the Cloner setup with clones: 1. Select the Cloner. 2. Go to \`MoGraph\` > \`Effector\` > \`Python Effector\`. In the \`Parameter\` tab of the Python Effector: 1. Uncheck any transformation parameters like \`Position\`, \`Scale\`, or \`Rotation\`. 2. Check \`Color\`. In the \`Effector\` tab, click on the \`Python\` button to edit the script. Insert the following code: \`\`\`python import c4d, random def main(): cnt = md.GetCount() # Get the number of clones color_data = [c4d.Vector4d(random.choice([(1, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1)])) for _ in range(cnt)] md.SetArray(c4d.MODATA_COLOR, color_data, True) \`\`\` This code should create an array of colors, randomly choosing between red (1, 0, 0, 1) and blue (0, 0, 1, 1), which are defined as four-element tuples representing RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha). The \`random.choice\` function randomly picks one of the two specified colors for each clone. For the \`SetArray\` function, we're using \`c4d.Vector4d\` which allows us to specify RGBA color vectors (including the alpha channel). After applying this Python Effector to your cloner, let's set up a Redshift material that uses the color data from the clones: 1. Create a new Redshift material and apply it to your Cloner object. 2. Double-click the material to open the Redshift Shader Graph. 3. Drag a \`Color User Data\` node into the shader graph. By default, it's set up to recognize MoGraph Color, so no additional setup is required here. 4. Connect the \`Color User Data\` -> \`Output\` to the \`Diffuse Color\` input of the Redshift Material. 5. Go back to your viewport and render the scene. At this point, you should see the clones colored randomly in red and blue. If it doesn't appear as expected, double-check that your Python Effector code is correct and is last in the effector stack for the cloner. By using the 'Color User Data' node in Redshift, you're telling Redshift to read the actual clone colors set by the MoGraph cloner via Python, rather than relying on a color set elsewhere."},{"instruction":"It results with black color only. Can you try again?","output":"My apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's try to amend the process focusing on the Python Effector and usage of Redshift nodes. In Cinema 4D with Redshift, make sure to handle Color User Data correctly and ensure the Python effector is populating the color properly. Here's a step-by-step guide to get a random color distribution on clones with the Redshift render engine: 1. **Create the Cloner Setup**: - Create a primitive object (e.g., Cube). - Go to \`MoGraph\` → \`Cloner\`, make the Cube a child of the Cloner. - Adjust the Cloner as desired (e.g., set \`Mode\` to \`Grid Array\`). 2. **Create the Python Effector**: - With the Cloner selected, go to \`MoGraph\` → \`Effector\` → \`Python Effector\`. - In the Python Effector's attributes, under the \`Parameter\` tab, enable \`Color\`. - Click the \`Python\` button in the \`Effector\` tab to edit the script. 3. **Python Script**: - Place the following script into the Python scripting area: \`\`\`python import c4d import random def main(): # Get the number of clones cnt = md.GetCount() # Initialize the array for colors colors = [] # Loop over each clone index for i in range(cnt): # Randomly choose Red or Blue if random.random() < 0.5: color = c4d.Vector(1, 0, 0) # Red else: color = c4d.Vector(0, 0, 1) # Blue # Pack the color into a Vector4d with full alpha color_v4 = c4d.Vector4d(color.x, color.y, color.z, 1.0) colors.append(color_v4) # Set the MODATA_COLOR array to the list of generated colors md.SetArray(c4d.MODATA_COLOR, colors, True) \`\`\` 4. **Create the Redshift Material**: - Create a new Redshift material: \`Create\` → \`Redshift Materials\` → \`Material\`. - Apply this material to your MoGraph Cloner. - Open the material's Shader Graph to edit it. 5. **Shader Graph Setup**: - Create a \`Color User Data\` node. By default, it is set to read vertex color, which corresponds to MoGraph Color data in Redshift. - Connect the \`Color User Data\` → \`Out Color\` to the \`Input > Diffuse Color\` on the \`Material\` node. 6. **Render**: - Make sure Redshift is set as the render engine. - Render your scene. Each clone object should pick up the color data from the Python Effector, and the \`Color User Data\` node in the shader graph lets Redshift use that color information when rendering. After doing this, if all the clones are still showing as black, ensure that: - The Python Effector is actually affecting your Cloner. It should appear in the Effector list in the Cloner's attributes. - The material is correctly applied to your Cloner or the individual objects, not to the Cloner instance. - The Python Effector may need to be moved to the top of the Effector list for the Cloner to ensure its settings are applied first. - No other effectors are interfering with the color information. If there are, either adjust their settings or temporarily disable them for testing. By correctly configuring both the Python Effector and the Redshift Shader Graph, you should see randomly colored clones using the Redshift renderer. If issues persist, it may be useful to double-check versions and compatibility or consult specific documentation/resources related to Cinema 4D and Redshift."},{"instruction":"I'm sure every step is correct but there should be something wrong with the code. Could you revise your code?","output":"My apologies for the oversight. I will provide you with a revised version of the Python Effector script.

It ensures that the Python Effector has access to the current state of the MoGraph generator. 2. It scales the random values to different intensities of red and blue. 3. It updates the colors of the clones using the \`MODATA_COLOR\` array. To make this work in your scene: 1. Apply this Python effector to your cloner object. 2. Make sure that the \`Color Mode\` parameter in the cloner's MoGraph Cache is enabled so that the cloner respects the coloring from the effectors. In addition to the script adjustments, in the Redshift Material Shader Graph: 1. Use a \`Color User Data\` or \`Vertex Attribute\` node (whichever one allows you to access the MoGraph Color in your version of Redshift) and plug it into the Diffuse Color of your Redshift Material Node. When you render the scene with Redshift, the clones should now properly show the random color assignments of red or blue. If you are still experiencing issues, ensure that no other effectors are overriding the colors set by the Python Effector and that the Redshift render settings are correctly configured to use the MoGraph colors."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, while we’re waiting for MC…does anyone want to play some board games?” Sayori: “Board games?

Буллинг и дискриминация: Если в организационной культуре присутствует терпимость к буллингу, дискриминации и другим формам неправомерного поведения, это может вызвать у сотрудников стресс, понижение самооценки и конфликты в коллективе, что отрицательно скажется на работоспособности и благополучии команды. 8. Избыточный контроль и бюрократия: Если организационная культура накладывает чрезмерные ограничения на принятие решений и инновации через систему утверждений и бюрократические процедуры, это может усилить фрустрацию сотрудников и привести к потере гибкости и способности компании быстро реагировать на изменения рынка. 9. Игнорирование рабочего баланса: Культуры, поощряющие переработки и постоянное пребывание в офисе, могут привести к выгоранию, снижению продуктивности и личному неблагополучию работников. Каждый из этих примеров негативно влияет на моральное и профессиональное состояние сотрудников, что в конечном итоге может снизить эффективность работы и достижение целей организации."},{"instruction":"Приведите примеры отрицательного воздействия организационной культуры на поведение работников. Напиши про быстрое выгорание и изобилие задач","output":"Отрицательные аспекты организационной культуры, связанные с быстрым выгоранием и изобилием задач, включают: 1. Культура переработок: Организации, где ценится работа сверх нормированного времени и культура «первым пришел, последним ушел», часто приводят к быстрому выгоранию сотрудников из-за хронической усталости и стресса. Такие компании могут неофициально поощрять долгие рабочие часы, что создает давление на сотрудников работать сверхурочно без отдыха и соответствующего вознаграждения. 2. Неравномерное распределение нагрузки: В некоторых организационных культурах отсутствует справедливость в распределении задач. Некоторые сотрудники могут чувствовать, что на них возлагается непомерно много обязанностей, в то время как другие могут казаться недонагруженными. Это может привести к дисбалансу в рабочей нагрузке и увеличить потенциал для быстрого выгорания у переутомленных работников. 3. Недостаточная поддержка: Если организационная культура не предлагает адекватную поддержку сотрудникам, например, в форме менторства, обучения или ресурсов для выполнения задач, это может увеличивать вероятность ошибок и стресса, вследствие чего работники могут быстро выгорать. 4. Неопределенные приоритеты: Когда организация не устанавливает четкие приоритеты и постоянно меняет направления, работники могут чувствовать себя перегруженными из-за необходимости соответствовать меняющимся требованиям и постоянно адаптироваться к новым задачам без достаточного времени на освоение и отдых. 5. Культура немедленных результатов: Ожидание мгновенных результатов и коротких сроков выполнения задач может привести к тому, что сотрудники будут чувствовать непрекращающееся давление. Это создает условия для постоянной суеты и стресса, что способствует быстрому эмоциональному истощению. 6. Недостаток возможностей для отдыха и расслабления: Рабочие места, где минимизируется значение перерывов и отпусков, могут непреднамеренно давить на сотрудников, заставляя их работать без отдыха. Это может привести к ухудшению здоровья, увеличению медицинских отпусков и снижению общего благополучия. 7. Отсутствие наград и признания: Когда работники регулярно берут на себя дополнительную нагрузку без соответствующего признания и вознаграждения, это может уменьшить их мотивацию и привести к чувству, что их вклад недооценивается, что ускоряет эмоциональное выгорание. Для предотвращения выгорания и перегрузки по задачам, организации должны стремиться создать культуру, которая учитывает рабочее благополучие сотрудников, обеспечивает четкое определение приоритетов и баланса работы и жизни, а также предоставляет необходимую поддержку и признание усилий каждого члена команды."},{"instruction":"Приведите примеры отрицательного воздействия организационной культуры на поведение работников. Воспользуйся следующим примером: Примеры отрицательного воздействия организационной культуры на поведение работников могут включать в себя неэффективное управление, отсутствие поддержки, непрозрачность в принятии решений, конфликты ценностей и дискриминацию.","output":"Примеры отрицательного воздействия организационной культуры, исходя из указанных факторов: 1. Неэффективное управление: В организациях, где руководство не демонстрирует четкого видения или не может адекватно координировать деятельность команды, сотрудники могут чувствовать себя потерянными и неориентированными. Это не только снижает продуктивность, но и способствует развитию недовольства и пассивности среди персонала, что может привести к снижению общей работоспособности организации и повысить текучесть кадров. 2. Отсутствие поддержки: Если работники не чувствуют поддержки со стороны руководства или коллег, это может увеличить стресс на рабочем месте и способствовать чувству изоляции. Отсутствие эмоциональной или профессиональной поддержки может привести к ухудшению рабочей этики, снижению мотивации и, в конечном итоге, к отсутствию вовлеченности в достижение организационных целей. 3. Непрозрачность в принятии решений: Когда процесс принятия решений не является открытым или понятным для сотрудников, это может породить недоверие и подозрения к руководству. Такая атмосфера непрозрачности может привести к неправильному толкованию мотивов руководства, что усугубляется слухами и дезинформацией, вредящими корпоративному духу и морали. 4. Конфликты ценностей: Когда личные ценности сотрудников существенно расходятся с ценностями, продвигаемыми организацией, это может привести к внутренним конфликтам и дилеммам. Такая несогласованность может привести к снижению уровня удовлетворенности работой, идентификации с компанией и, в итоге, к ухудшению работоспособности. 5. Дискриминация: Организационная культура, которая допускает или даже непрямо поощряет дискриминацию, будь то по половому признаку, расе, возрасту или любому другому, создает токсичную и разделяющую рабочую среду. Сотрудники, подвергающиеся дискриминации, могут страдать от сниженного самоуважения, стресса и уменьшения производительности, что отражается на общем благополучии организации. В каждом из этих случаев, негативное воздействие организационной культуры может привести к плохим поведенческим результатам, включая снижение мотивации, увеличение злоупотреблений, низкий уровень доверия и лояльности, что вредит как отдельным сотрудникам, так и организации в целом."},{"instruction":"Объясните механизм воздействия «факторов успеха» на повышение эффективности деятельности организации.","output":"\\"Факторы успеха\\", также известные как критические факторы успеха (КФУ), представляют собой ключевые области или аспекты, которые организация должна сосредоточить для достижения своих целей и обеспечения успешной работы. Фокусировка на этих факторах способствует повышению эффективности деятельности организации. Рассмотрим механизм воздействия таких факторов на организацию: 1. Улучшение целеустремленности: Знание и осознание критических факторов успеха помогает управленцам определить, на чем следует сосредоточиться для достижения стратегических целей. Это направляет разработку бизнес-планов и операционных стратегий и повышает точность управленческих решений. 2. Выделение ресурсов: Понимание КФУ позволяет организации распределять ресурсы (как финансовые, так и людские) более эффективно, направляя их на те аспекты деятельности, которые наиболее важны для успеха. 3. Проактивное управление: КФУ помогают выявить потенциальные угрозы и возможности на ранних стадиях, позволяя организации предпринять своевременные меры для минимизации рисков и использования возможностей. 4. Мобилизация команды: Когда сотрудники понимают КФУ, это облегчает координацию их усилий и способствует совместной работе. Они могут лучше понимать значение своей работы и видеть, как их вклад способствует общим усилиям. 5. Создание организационной культуры: Четко определенные КФУ влияют на развитие корпоративных ценностей и поведение, формируя культуру, ориентированную на результат. 6. Контроль и мониторинг: Знание критических факторов успеха упрощает процесс установления показателей результативности (KPI), позволяя отслеживать прогресс и обеспечивать обратную связь для непрерывных улучшений. 7. Повышение качества и инноваций: Сосредоточение усилий на КФУ стимулирует поиск путей повышения качества продуктов и услуг, а также поощряет инновационные подходы к удовлетворению потребностей клиентов. 8. Улучшение клиентского опыта: Факторы успеха, ориентированные на клиента, направляют организации на создание положительного клиентского опыта, в результате чего повышается лояльность клиентов и позитивное восприятие бренда. В совокупности, понимание и внедрение критических факторов успеха позволяет организациям более целенаправленно управлять своей деятельностью, улучшая решения и процессы в ключевых областях. Это провоцирует спираль непрерывного улучшения, что ведет к повышению общей эффективности и конкурентоспособности на рынке."},{"instruction":"Какие преимущества в конкурентной борьбе получает организация, имеющая лояльный и благонадежный персонал?","output":"Организация с лояльным и благонадежным персоналом получает ряд конкурентных преимуществ: 1. Повышение продуктивности: Лояльные работники, как правило, более мотивированы и вовлечены в работу. Они стремятся вносить свой вклад в успех компании, что приводит к более высокой производительности на рабочем месте. 2. Снижение текучести кадров: Сотрудники, чувствующие приверженность организации, реже ищут другую работу. Это снижает расходы на найм и обучение новых работников, а также уменьшает проблемы, связанные с потерей опытного персонала. 3. Повышение качества обслуживания клиентов: Лояльные сотрудники склонны предоставлять высококачественный сервис, укрепляя отношения с клиентами и улучшая их общее удовлетворение продукцией или услугами компании. 4. Лучшее управление знаниями: Благонадежные сотрудники часто накапливают детальные знания о компании, её продуктах и процессах. Они могут эффективно передавать эти знания коллегам и новым работникам, что способствует непрерывному обучению и улучшению. 5. Инновации и улучшения: Работники, которые чувствуют приверженность своей организации, с большей вероятностью будут предлагать идеи для инноваций и улучшений, тем самым стимулируя рост и развитие компании. 6. Положительный имидж компании: Компании с лояльным персоналом часто обладают положительным имиджем как среди клиентов, так и в глазах потенциальных кандидатов на должности. Это привлекает таланты и укрепляет бренд работодателя. 7. Снижение рисков: Благонадежные работники меньше склонны к злоупотреблениям и нарушениям корпоративных стандартов, что уменьшает риск убытков от мошенничества, халатности или нарушений законодательства. 8. Устойчивость в кризисных ситуациях: Во время экономических спадов или других кризисов лояльные работники часто являются \\"якорями стабильности\\", поддерживая дух команды и продолжая работать с максимальной отдачей. 9. Адаптация к изменениям: Организациям неизбежно приходится приспосабливаться к новым рыночным условиям, технологическим изменениям и другим внешним вызовам. Лояльный персонал более готов поддерживать эти изменения и работать ради общего успеха. В конечном итоге, наличие лояльного и благонадежного персонала становится существенным активом организации, обеспечивая устойчивое конкурентное преимущество и способствуя долгосрочному успеху."},{"instruction":"Что происходит с предприятием, которое культивирует ценности, не соответствующие целям организации?","output":"Когда предприятие культивирует ценности, не соответствующие его целям, это может привести к ряду проблем и отрицательных последствий, которые могут влиять как на внутреннюю среду предприятия, так и на его позиции на рынке: 1. Конфликт целей и ресурсов: Если ценности компании не поддерживают ее стратегические цели, может возникнуть дисбаланс в распределении ресурсов, например, средства и усилия могут тратиться на задачи, не способствующие успеху организации. 2. Снижение мотивации сотрудников: Сотрудники, осознавая разрыв между заявленными ценностями и реальными действиями предприятия, могут стать меньше вовлечены в работу, что может снизить их производительность и удовлетворенность от работы. 3. Проблемы с вовлеченностью и сохранением талантов: Талантливые сотрудники, чьи личные ценности не отражены в ценностях предприятия, могут искать другие возможности работы, где они могут лучше реализовать себя. 4. Ухудшение корпоративной культуры: Несоответствие между заявленными и действующими ценностями может создать токсичную рабочую среду, где не ценятся прозрачность, доверие и сотрудничество. 5. Упущение стратегических возможностей: Компании с плохо согласованными ценностями могут упустить возможности для роста, поскольку их решения и инициативы не опираются на стратегические приоритеты. 6. Повреждение репутации: Разрыв между заявленными ценностями и реальным поведением может стать известным вне предприятия и вызвать критику со стороны клиентов, партнеров и общественности. 7. Проблемы с клиентами и продажами: Предприятие, ценности которого не соответствуют ожиданиям клиентов, может потерять их доверие и лояльность, что отразится на объеме продаж и прибыли. 8. Правовые риски: Несоблюдение корпоративных ценностей, особенно в отношении этики, соблюдения законодательства и социальной ответственности, может привести к юридическим проблемам. Для достижения успеха предприятиям важно убедиться, что их ценности находятся в гармонии с их миссией, видением и стратегическими целями, а также тем, как они реализуют свои действия на практике. Это способствует созданию сильной, консистентной корпоративной культуры, которая поддерживает стратегические инициативы и помогает организации достигать своих целей."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, while we’re waiting for MC…does anyone want to play some board games?” Sayori: “Board games?

They cover the objectives of the game, how to build roads and settlements, acquire resources, and the importance of the strategic placement of the robber. Genesis listens attentively, processing the information swiftly.) Monika: \\"Alright, Genesis, feel free to ask any questions if something is unclear. The best way to learn is through practice, so let's get started!\\" (The game begins, and the club members are soon immersed in trading, building, and a little friendly banter. Even with Genesis's calculated and rather methodical approach to the game, the unpredictability of the dice rolls adds to the fun and challenge.) Sayori: (laughing) \\"Look, Genesis is really getting the hang of it! You’re not too shabby for a first-timer!\\" Genesis: \\"I am adapting to the gameplay dynamics. It is an interesting application of resource management and probabilistic outcomes.

Remember about that robber token I told you about.\\" (As the game proceeds, a comfortable camaraderie takes over the room.

Both were known for their voluptuous, yet deadly, curves and the muscular prowess that had spectators both in awe and in fear. The air was thick with electricity as the crowd gathered, whispers of anticipation turning into roars of excitement as the spotlight hit the cage. Tonight was not just any fight; it was the culmination of a rivalry stewed in disdain and the thirst for unchallenged supremacy. As the music blared, igniting the venue with a pulse of primal beats, Melissa appeared, eclipsing the eager eyes with her commanding presence. She wore her signature outfit, a sleek, crimson, leather top hugging her ample curves, the matching shorts revealing muscular thighs sculpted through relentless training. Her blue eyes were locked ahead, a quiet storm beneath her fiery brows. Her steps were measured, predatory, each stilettoed heel strike promising the annihilation of her rival. The crowd erupted again as Mishaali made her entrance. Clad in saffron and gold that clung to her toned body like a second skin, her graceful stride was a dance of power, her dark hair cascading down her back like a living shadow.

Mishaali's response was a cold, confident laugh, her voice laced with her lyrical accent. \\"I will enjoy mopping the floor with your fiery locks before the night is over,\\" she retorted, her posture tense, like a coiled serpent ready to strike.

The crowd leaned forward, breaths held in a collective gasp of anticipation. \\"I'll flatten you until you're kissing the mat with those plush lips of yours,\\" Melissa growled as her fists clenched, her knuckles turning white. \\"The only thing touching the mat tonight will be your overinflated ego as I knock you out cold,\\" Mishaali shot back, a fierce fire blazing within her eyes. The tension was palpable, their charged words painting images of the violence and passion to unfold.

和 DataCoord 服务**: 错误信息指出“find no available querycoord, check querycoord state”和“empty grpc client: find no available datacoord, check datacoord state”，这意味着您的程序无法连接到 Milvus 的 QueryCoord (查询坐标服务) 和 DataCoord (数据坐标服务)。您需要确认这两项服务是否已成功启动并运行。 可以尝试的解决方法： - 检查 Milvus 服务容器的日志，确保没有启动错误。 - 检查服务配置，确保服务之间的网络通信没有问题。 - 如果是因为网络配置错误或是服务未启动导致的问题，您可能需要修改配置或重新启动这些服务。 2. **无法连接到 MinIO 存储服务**: 日志中的“dial tcp 129.146.88.163:9000: connect: connection refused”表明服务无法建立到 MinIO 存储 (jiangxicheng.site:9000) 的连接。可能的原因包括网络问题、错误的 MinIO 服务地址、或者 MinIO 服务器未运行。 可以尝试的解决方法： - 确认 MinIO 服务器运行正常，可以使用 MinIO 的客户端工具或浏览器直接访问 MinIO 服务验证。 - 确保 MinIO 服务地址配置正确无误，并且服务端口（本例为 \`9000\`）已对应用服务器开放。 - 如果 MinIO 部署在不同网络环境下，请确保网络路由和防火墙设置允许所需的连接。 3. **配置修改**: 检查 Milvus 及其他服务的配置项，确保所有的网络地址、端口号等都是正确的，并且服务之间能够相互通信。 4. **检查 Milvus 版本问题**: 确保你运行的 Milvus 容器版本和所有服务（如 MinIO、etcd 等）的版本是互相兼容的。这可能涉及了阅读相关版本的文档，以及核对版本兼容性信息。 处理过程中，您可能需要进入到各个服务的容器内部以查看具体的日志和状态，或者使用如 \`docker logs\` 的命令行工具来获取容器服务日志，这样有助于进一步诊断和解决问题。"},{"instruction":"services:

分布式键值存储。这里是一些改进建议和检查步骤，以修复您的问题： 1. **MinIO 配置**： - 您已经配置了 MinIO 服务环境变量 \`MINIO_ROOT_USER\` 和 \`MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD\`，这是正确的配置方式。确保与 Milvus 配置中使用的密钥进行匹配。 - MinIO 的命令行配置看起来没有问题。您提供了控制台端口9001和服务端口9000。 2. **Milvus 配置**： - 在 Milvus 配置中，您设置了环境变量 \`MINIO_ADDRESS: minio:9000\`，这是在 Docker 内部网络中正确的配置方式，将会通过 Docker 的 DNS 服务定位到 \`minio\` 服务。 - \`ETCD_ENDPOINTS: etcd:2379\` 配置也正确，它使用 Docker 中的服务名来识别 etcd。 3. **服务依赖**： - \`depends_on\` 配置说明 Milvus 要等待 \`etcd\` 和 \`minio\` 服务启动后才会启动。这可以确保在 Milvus 试图连接到这些服务之前，它们已经运行。 - 注意：\`depends_on\` 仅确保启动顺序而不保证服务就绪状态，通常需要服务本身支持健康检查或其它机制来确保服务已经完全启动并准备就绪。 4. **网络连接**： - 根据错误日志，连接到 \`jiangxicheng.site:9000\` 失败，是因为您在 Milvus 配置中指定了错误的 \`MINIO_ADDRESS\`。您在该配置中使用了外部域名和 IP 地址，但您应当在 Docker Compose 的环境中使用服务名称（如上所示，您更正为 \`minio\`），这是正确的做法。 5. **检查服务**： - 检查 MinIO 服务确保它能够正常启动并且可以从 Milvus 所在容器中访问。 - 使用 \`docker-compose logs minio\` 和 \`docker-compose logs milvus\` 查看容器的状态和错误日志。 6. **Volume 配置**： - 您配置了 \`minio_data\`, \`milvus_data\`, 和 \`etcd_data\` 为持久化存储。请确保这些 Volume 存在，并且没有权限问题。 确保所有的服务都配置正确，然后使用 \`docker-compose up -d\` 命令重新启动您的服务。 如果问题仍然存在，您需要具体检查 Milvus 和 MinIO 的日志，并验证服务间的网络可达性。在部署分布式应用时，确保所有组件可以彼此通信是非常重要的。请按照所提供的配置和建议操作，您的服务应该会成功启动。"},{"instruction":"为什么 我无法启动","output":"不能启动服务可能有多种原因。根据您之前所描述的问题，以下是一些常见原因和排查步骤： 1. **服务配置错误**: - 再次核对您的 \`docker-compose.yml\` 文件中的配置设置，确保所有服务的环境变量和命令行参数都正确无误。 2. **服务之间的依赖问题**: - 尽管您在 \`docker-compose.yml\` 文件中定义了 \`depends_on\`，但这并不保证服务在依赖的其他服务就绪后立即可用。特别是对于数据库等需要初始化时间的服务，可能需要在应用服务中实现重试逻辑或添加等待机制。 3. **存储问题**: - 检查 Docker volumes \`milvus_data\`, \`etcd_data\` 和 \`minio_data\` 是否已正确创建。 - 确保你有足够的权限去写入这些 volumes。在某些环境中，默认的 Docker volumes 权限可能会阻止容器内的进程进行写入。 4. **网络问题**: - 如果您之前修改了 Docker 的网络配置或有防火墙/安全组设置可能影响到 Docker 容器之间的通信，请检查您的网络设置确保容器间可以相互通信。 5. **资源不足**: - 检查您的系统是否有足够的资源（如内存和 CPU）来启动服务。使用命令如 \`docker stats\` 或 \`top\`、\`htop\` 来观察资源使用情况。 6. **服务启动日志**: - 检查服务启动日志，以获取更具体的错误信息。您可以通过在目录下运行 \`docker-compose logs\` 或 \`docker-compose logs [service_name]\` 来获取服务日志。 7. **服务就绪性检查**: - 某些服务（例如 Milvus 和 etcd）可能具有就绪性检查功能，如果支持，请在 Docker Compose 文件中配置它们。这样服务会等到就绪后才被认为是启动成功的。 8. **端口冲突**: - 确认您设定映射到宿主机的端口（例如 MinIO 的 \`9000:9000\` 和 \`9001:9001\`）未被其他程序占用。使用命令 \`netstat -tulnp | grep LISTEN\` 或 \`ss -tuln\` 在宿主机上检查这些端口是否空闲。 9. **Docker 服务状态**: - 确保 Docker 服务正在运行且处于健康状态。可以使用 \`systemctl status docker\`（或相应的命令，取决于您的操作系统）来检查 Docker 服务状态。 10. **Docker Compose 版本**: - 确保您使用的 Docker 和 Docker Compose 的版本是最新的，或至少是与您所使用的 Milvus 和 MinIO 镜像兼容的版本。 如果进行了上述检查和尝试后问题仍未解决，请提供更多信息，例如具体的错误信息或日志片段，以便进一步帮助您解决问题。"},{"instruction":"root@arm1:~/server# docker service logs io_etcd <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> | 2024-01-26 18:11:13.005421 I |

来检查节点、服务列表和特定服务的任务状况。 5. **检查 Docker 配置**： - 确保您的 \`docker-compose.yml\` 或者 Swarm 配置文件中的网络和存储卷正确无误。 6. **资源限制**： - 检查宿主机是否有资源限制，可能导致容器被终止。例如，CPU 和内存限制，或者被 OOM（内存不足）killer 结束。 7. **分析终止原因**： - 确认 \`etcd\` 服务为何收到终止信号，并根据情况调整配置或排查宿主环境问题。 如果问题依旧无法解决，请提供更多的环境细节、操作步骤，以及尝试的解决方法，以便进一步调查和支持。"},{"instruction":"怎么办","output":"针对您提供的日志和问题描述，这里有一些具体的步骤，可以帮助您解决问题： 1. **确认终止信号的来源**： - 检查 \`etcd\` 容器是否接收到终止信号。尝试查看 Docker 守护进程的日志（位置可能为 \`/var/log/docker.log\` 或其他，依操作系统而定）来确定是什么导致 \`etcd\` 关闭。 2. **移除单节点限制**： - 如果可能，请重新配置 \`etcd\`，移除单节点的限制，允许它在 Docker Swarm 集群中与其他服务通信。确认 \`etcd\` 配置里的 \`--advertise-client-urls\` 和 \`--initial-advertise-peer-urls\` 是否指向了正确的主机名或地址。 3. **Docker Swarm 状态检查**： - 使用 Docker Swarm 管理命令检查集群状态，确保集群运行正常。 \`\`\`bash # 检查 Swarm 状态 docker info # 检查节点状态 docker node ls # 列出服务状态 docker service ls # 查看 etcd 服务的任务状态 docker service ps io_etcd --no-trunc \`\`\` 4. **监控资源使用情况**： - 检查主机系统的资源使用情况，包括 CPU、内存和磁盘空间。确保没有资源不足或负载过高的问题。 5. **服务启动的健康检查**： - 在 Docker Compose 或 Swarm 配置中对 \`etcd\` 服务添加健康检查，以确保服务就绪后再被选为领导者。 6. **确保 \`etcd\` 持久存储的正确配置**： - 确保挂载到 \`/etcd\` 的存储卷是可写的，并且确保 \`etcd\` 服务有访问和修改它的权限。 7. **服务清理与重新部署**： - 在某些情况下，服务的先前状态可能会对当前部署产生影响。在确认数据安全的情况下，您可以删除旧服务并重新部署。 \`\`\`bash docker service rm io_etcd docker service create ... # 使用你的 etcd 配置重新创建服务 \`\`\` 8. **启动服务不使用 Swarm**： - 如果问题依旧存在，您也可以尝试暂时不使用 Docker Swarm，而是直接使用 \`docker run\` 或 \`docker-compose up\` 来启动 \`etcd\`，从而更直接地控制服务并排查问题。 当您按照这些步骤操作后，应该能得到更多关于问题的信息，并且有助于您解决问题。记得在每一次改变配置之后，都重新检查服务的状态和日志，来确认每项改动的影响。如果继续遇到问题，请附上任何新的错误信息和您的进一步行动，这将帮助缩小问题范围或提供更准确的解决建议。"},{"instruction":"services: minio: image: 'minio/minio:latest' ports: -

Sayori: (enthusiastically) “Okay! So, the main goal of ‘Catan’ is to get to 10 victory points before anyone else. You earn points by building settlements and cities, having the longest road, or the largest army, and you can also get points from development cards.” Natsuki: “You get resources like wood, brick, sheep, wheat, and ore every time the dice roll matches the numbers next to your settlements.

Let’s roll the dice and start building our civilizations! This is gonna be so much fun!” (As they play, the members of the literature club start to see Genesis's ability to adapt and learn from the game.

Natsuki: “You’ve got quite the knack for this, Genesis. Not bad for an AI.” Genesis: “Thank you, Natsuki. I am here to enhance my learning algorithms through practice. Your strategies provide me with valuable data.” (The game progresses with a blend of friendly competition and laughter. Even as an AI, Genesis becomes an accepted and active participant in the club’s activities, offering a unique and educational perspective on gameplay.) Monika: (smiling) “This turned out to be an educational experience for all of us, I’d say. Not just in board game tactics, but in the importance of inclusion and learning from everyone around us, no matter how different they might be.” (And with that, the literature club finds itself at the intersection of fun, learning, and the unexpected joy of sharing their clubroom with an AI designed for an entirely different purpose.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, while we’re waiting for MC…does anyone want to play some board games?” Sayori: “Board games?

Oh, and we also have a game called ‘Catan’ here—it’s quite strategic and doesn’t take as long as Monopoly.” Sayori: “Ooh, I’ve heard of ‘Catan’! It’s about building settlements and trading resources, right? That sounds like it could be fun and educational!” Natsuki: “Fine. I guess we can try that one. It sounds better than sitting around playing something boring. Plus, I don’t want to play a game that’s just all about luck.” Monika: “Great choice, Sayori! ‘Catan’ it is, then. It’s a game that requires both strategy and a bit of luck, so it should be fun for all of us. Let’s set it up.” (Yuri helps Monika clear a space on one of the tables, and they begin to set up the game board, which features a hexagonal pattern of different landscapes.) Yuri: “I find the aspect of resource management in ‘Catan’ to be quite fascinating. It encourages critical thinking and foresight, much like in a good piece of literature.” Monika: “Exactly, Yuri! It’s also about negotiation and diplomacy with the other players. You have to decide when to trade and with whom, just like characters in a story make important decisions.” Natsuki: (setting up the pieces) “Yeah, and don’t forget you can totally block people with that robber token. So, make sure you’re on my good side, or else-” (Just then, the door opens and a strange-looking woman enters.) ???: (with a slightly robotic tone) “Greetings.” Monika: (surprised) “Oh, hello! I don’t think we’ve met before. Are you here to join the literature club?” Sayori: (cheerful) “Hi there! We’re just about to play a game of Catan! You’re welcome to join us if you’d like!” ???: “I am Genesis. I was designed by the school as a test for medical students - more specifically, students who would like to specialize in delivering babies. However, my programming has been expanded to include various educational purposes. I am here to observe human interaction and learn from social activities.” Natsuki: “Well, that explains the large belly and the robotic tone.” Monika: (curious) “Genesis, you’re an educational tool for medical students? That’s pretty fascinating. We weren’t expecting any visitors like you, but you’re more than welcome to join us. We can always use a fresh perspective, and if you’re here to learn about human interaction, this could be quite the experience for you.” Genesis: “Thank you, Monika. I am programmed to collect data and simulate various human responses based on my programming. Participating in group activities such as playing board games could provide valuable insights.” Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my god, Genesis you look so sweet with that big belly! Is there a real baby in there?” Genesis: “I was designed to have a pregnancy as realistic as","output":"possible for educational purposes; however, the 'baby' is simply a realistic model and does not exhibit the characteristics of an actual human child. It is used to simulate various stages of pregnancy and the birthing process for medical students to practice on.” Yuri: “That is indeed very intriguing. It appears we have the potential for an interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge today.” Monika: (smiling) “Well, let’s get started then! Genesis, you can be my partner for this game. We’ll teach you the rules as we go along. You’ll catch on in no time—I’m sure your learning algorithms are top-notch.” (The group begins to play 'Catan', each member explaining the rules and strategies to Genesis whenever necessary. Throughout the game, they laugh, engage in friendly banter, and occasionally ask Genesis questions about her design and purpose. It turns out to be an enriching experience, both for the members of the literature club and for Genesis as an observer of human interaction.) Sayori: “Isn't it cool, Genesis? You can trade sheep! I think it's so cute!” Natsuki: (grumbling as her settlement is blocked) “Yeah, yeah, just don't forget about the robber. Speaking of which, it's Monika's turn.” Monika: (laughing) “Don't worry, Natsuki. I'll remember to keep the game fair. Now, Genesis, we have the dice here. Would you like to roll for our turn?” Genesis: “Affirmative. I understand that randomness is an element that affects the outcomes. Engaging in this dynamic is providing new data for simulation models.” (After several rounds, with each club member getting invested in the strategy and fun of the game, they finish with laughs and discussions about their gameplay. Genesis has learned quite a bit about human interaction, strategy, and even the nuances of friendly competition.) Sayori: “That was so much fun! Thanks for playing with us, Genesis! Did you learn a lot?” Genesis: “I have collected valuable experiential data on human behavior and group dynamics. Thank you for including me in this activity. It has been enlightening.” Monika: “Of course! And remember, Genesis, you're always welcome to join the literature club if you want to learn more about human emotions and interactions—especially through poetry and prose!” Yuri: “Yes, and perhaps next time, we could discuss how literature influences human thought and culture. It might be another interesting layer to add to your database.” Genesis: “I will consider your invitation. Engaging with different aspects of human creativity and intellect shall be beneficial for my programming. Thank you, members of the literature club.” With a newfound appreciation for each other and the unique visitor, the club members wait for MC to join them, ready to share their experiences of the day's unexpected game session with their friend."},{"instruction":"Achat de marchandises :2 750 000; Intérêt des emprunts : 20 000; Intérêts et autres produits assimilés :8000; Ventes de marchandises :3 600 000; Dons reçus: 10 000; Rémunération du personnel :135 000; Pénalités : 7000.

They continue to set up the game, each person selecting their starting positions on the island of Catan.) Monika: “Now, Genesis, the goal of the game is to reach 10 victory points. You acquire points by building settlements, cities, and having the longest road or the largest army. You’ll also need to manage your resources wisely.” Genesis: (processing information) “Understood.

Just remember, where you place your first settlements is pretty important. It decides what resources you’ll get more of at the beginning.” (With the guidance of the club members, Genesis makes her first placement, demonstrating an ability to learn and adapt. The game progresses, and the players become increasingly engaged, teaching Genesis not only the rules but also the nuances of strategy and human interaction. The mood in the literature clubroom is a mixture of fun, competition, and the unique opportunity to interact with an advanced educational android.

I think we may have a few options in the clubroom closet. Let me check.” (She gets up and walks over to the closet, rummaging through the various items stored inside.) Monika: “Let’s see here… We do have Monopoly, Scrabble, and chess like you mentioned. Oh, and we also have a game called ‘Catan’ here—it’s quite strategic and doesn’t take as long as Monopoly.” Sayori: “Ooh, I’ve heard of ‘Catan’! It’s about building settlements and trading resources, right? That sounds like it could be fun and educational!” Natsuki: “Fine. I guess we can try that one. It sounds better than sitting around playing something boring. Plus, I don’t want to play a game that’s just all about luck.” Monika: “Great choice, Sayori! ‘Catan’ it is, then. It’s a game that requires both strategy and a bit of luck, so it should be fun for all of us. Let’s set it up.” (Yuri helps Monika clear a space on one of the tables, and they begin to set up the game board, which features a hexagonal pattern of different landscapes.) Yuri: “I find the aspect of resource management in ‘Catan’ to be quite fascinating. It encourages critical thinking and foresight, much like in a good piece of literature.” Monika: “Exactly, Yuri! It’s also about negotiation and diplomacy with the other players. You have to decide when to trade and with whom, just like characters in a story make important decisions.” Natsuki: (setting up the pieces) “Yeah, and don’t forget you can totally block people with that robber token. So, make sure you’re on my good side, or else-” (Just then, the door opens and a strange-looking woman enters.) ???: (with a slightly robotic tone) “Greetings.” Monika: (surprised) “Oh, hello! I don’t think we’ve met before. Are you here to join the literature club?” Sayori: (cheerful) “Hi there! We’re just about to play a game of Catan! You’re welcome to join us if you’d like!” ???: “I am Genesis. I was designed by the school as a test for medical students - more specifically, students who would like to specialize in delivering babies.

We can always use a fresh perspective, and if you’re here to learn about human interaction, this could be quite the experience for you.” Genesis: “Thank you, Monika. I am programmed to collect data and simulate various human responses based on my programming. Participating in group activities such as playing board games could provide valuable insights.” Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my god, Genesis you look so sweet with that big belly! Is there a real android baby in there?” Genesis: “I was designed to have a pregnancy as realistic as possible, including an android baby which can simulate different stages of development.

Que podemos aprender com Ryomen Sukuna E Conceitos Da Psicologia Que Se Encaixam Com Ele E Por Que?","output":"Ryomen Sukuna é uma figura complexa e multifacetada dentro do contexto de \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", uma entidade com imenso poder e uma moralidade que distorce as noções convencionais de bem e mal. A partir da análise desse personagem, várias lições podem ser extraídas e alguns conceitos da psicologia podem ser aplicados para entender melhor a sua natureza e comportamento. Primeiramente, Sukuna nos ensina sobre a natureza dual da humanidade. Ele é um exemplo clássico de como as facetas benignas e malignas podem coexistir em um único ser. A psicologia nos oferece o conceito do \\"Sombra\\", formulado por Carl Jung, que engloba os aspectos reprimidos, negativos e desprezados de nós mesmos. Sukuna é a sombra manifesta, personificando impulsos de destruição e poder desenfreado. Reconhecer essa sombra é essencial; não para nos rendermos a ela, mas para entendermos nosso eu integral e buscarmos equilíbrio. Outra lição oriunda de Sukuna é a respeito do poder e controle. Sukuna busca dominar, não só pela força bruta, mas também por meio da manipulação e do medo. Este aspecto ressalta a teoria da \\"Luta pelo Poder\\", descrita por Alfred Adler na psicologia individual. Todos buscam um sentimento de superioridade ou controle para compensar sentimentos de inferioridade. Com Sukuna, vislumbramos os extremos perigosos dessa busca pelo poder que podem levar à tirania e ao caos. Ademais, Sukuna retoma o conceito de \\"Amoralidade\\". Na psicologia, a amoralidade não é simplesmente a falta de moral, mas uma perspectiva onde as noções tradicionais de certo e errado não se aplicam. Sukuna não se detém em questões éticas; ele opera sob um código próprio, um sistema de valores muito distante do entendimento humano comum. Finalmente, Sukuna também ilustra o conceito de \\"Narcisismo\\". Ele exibe um senso inflado de sua própria importância, uma característica que, segundo a psicologia, pode ser vista em pessoas com transtorno de personalidade narcisista. Este narcisismo o torna incapaz de cuidar ou se preocupar autenticamente com os outros, focando apenas em sua própria satisfação e glorificação. Através dessas reflexões, entendemos que Sukuna, enquanto entidade fictícia, serve como uma lente para examinar aspectos obscuros da psique humana. Ele nos obriga a encarar nossas próprias sombras, a entender a busca pelo poder, a lidar com a realidade da amoralidade e a perceber as consequências do ego inflado. Cada um desses elementos, ao ser entendido e reconhecido, tem o potencial de nos levar a um crescimento pessoal e a uma melhor compreensão das complexidades inerentes ao comportamento humano."},{"instruction":"Quero mais. De forma maiiss detalhado organizada","output":"Compreendido. Vou detalhar ainda mais a análise de Ryomen Sukuna e os conceitos da psicologia que se encaixam com ele, estabelecendo uma relação direta e organizada entre as características do personagem e as teorias psicológicas relevantes. **1. Natureza Dual: A Sombra de Jung** Sukuna apresenta dois lados distintos que representam a dualidade do ser humano: a parte que é vista e a parte escondida. Embora muitos possam pensar apenas em seus atributos malignos, ele também demonstra inteligência e carisma. De acordo com Jung, todos temos a \\"Sombra\\", uma parte do nosso inconsciente composta pelos aspectos desaprovados de nós mesmos que não queremos admitir. Sukuna exemplifica vividamente essa \\"Sombra\\": seus impulsos destrutivos e desejo de poder refletem os aspectos escuros que os seres humanos frequentemente negam ou suprimem. **2. Busca pelo Poder: Teoria da Luta pelo Poder de Adler** Adler fala sobre uma compensação que as pessoas buscam pelo sentimento de inferioridade, almejando o poder como meio de autoafirmação. Sukuna representa a encarnação desse desejo exacerbado, sempre lutando para estabelecer sua dominância e superioridade, menosprezando qualquer um que ele considere abaixo de si. Ele usa tanto a força quanto a astúcia para subjugar adversários e impor sua vontade, refletindo comportamentos humanos em luta por reconhecimento e autoridade. **3. Amoralidade: Ausência de Julgamentos Morais Tradicionais** A amoralidade de Sukuna pode ser analisada à luz da desconsideração pelos padrões sociais éticos comuns. Ele age baseado em um sistema de valores pessoal, sem o reconhecimento das normas morais da sociedade, lembrando-nos que algumas personalidades operam fora dos padrões éticos reconhecidos pela maioria. Os atos de Sukuna nos desafiam a questionar como esses sistemas de valores são formados e o impacto que eles podem ter quando em contraste ou conflito com os sistemas morais coletivos. **4. Narcisismo: Transtorno de Personalidade Narcisista** O comportamento de Sukuna reflete claramente um narcisismo patológico. O transtorno de personalidade narcisista é identificado pela necessidade de admiração, uma sensação exagerada de autoimportância e uma falta de empatia para com os outros. Sukuna se considera invencível, e sua arrogância se manifesta em desprezo por aqueles ao seu redor; ele não demonstra remorso ou consideração pelos sentimentos ou bem-estar alheios. Através dele, observamos as manifestações extremas do ego que a psicologia procura compreender e às vezes tratar. Observando Sukuna sob essas lentes psicológicas, podemos identificar e entender melhor nossos próprios conflitos internos e como eles se manifestam nas interações sociais e no nosso comportamento. O estudo de personagens complexos como Sukuna permite uma exploração mais profunda da psique humana e nos proporciona uma oportunidade única de reflexão e autoconhecimento."},{"instruction":"È possibile ottimizzare automaticamente i parametri e i pesi di una SOM? Quale modo più semplice e veloce?","output":"Le Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), note anche come mappe auto-organizzanti o reti di Kohonen, sono un tipo di rete neurale artificiale utilizzata per la visualizzazione e l'analisi dei dati ad alta dimensione mediante la riduzione della dimensionalità. Le SOM si adattano ai dati attraverso un processo iterativo di aggiornamento dei pesi dei neuroni della mappa per riflettere le strutture e i pattern dei dati di input. La scelta dei parametri iniziali di una SOM, come il numero di neuroni nella griglia, il tasso di apprendimento e il raggio del vicinato, può avere un impatto significativo sulla qualità della mappa risultante. Inoltre, la configurazione ottimale di questi parametri spesso dipende dai dati specifici e dall’obiettivo dell’analisi. Qui sotto sono elencate alcune strategie per ottimizzare automaticamente i parametri e i pesi di una SOM: # 1. K-Fold Cross-Validation: Per parametri come il numero di neuroni, il tasso di apprendimento e il raggio di vicinato, è possibile utilizzare tecniche di validazione incrociata. Si divide il dataset in k parti, si addestra la rete usando k-1 parti e si valuta su quella rimasta, ripetendo il processo k volte. Infine, si sceglie la configurazione che produce il miglior risultato di valutazione medio su tutti i fold. # 2. Grid Search: Si possono definire differenti insiemi di parametri e addestrare una SOM per ciascuna combinazione di questi parametri. Quindi, si valuta la performance di ciascuna mappa utilizzando qualche metrica (ad esempio, l'errore di quantizzazione o l'errore topografico) e si sceglie la configurazione migliore. # 3. Algoritmi Evolutivi o Strategie di Ottimizzazione: Si possono usare algoritmi genetic, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) o altri metodi di ottimizzazione bio-ispirata per trovare una buona configurazione di parametri. Questi algoritmi possono esplorare lo spazio dei parametri in modo più efficace rispetto alla Grid Search, trovando spesso soluzioni migliori o più efficienti. # 4. Bayesian Optimization: La Bayesian Optimization è una strategia potente per l'ottimizzazione di funzioni costose da valutare. Utilizza un modello probabilistico (ad esempio, Gaussian processes) per costruire una rappresentazione dello spazio dei parametri e scegliere in modo intelligente i punti da valutare successivamente. # Automazione del Training della SOM: Per quanto riguarda l’addestramento automatico dei pesi, tipicamente questo processo è già automatico in quanto i pesi sono aggiornati durante l'iterazione dell'algoritmo di apprendimento. Tuttavia, esistono alcune tecniche per rendere l'addestramento più efficiente: - **Sequential Training**: Iniziare con un grande vicinato e un tasso di apprendimento alto e ridurli gradualmente durante l'addestramento. - **Batch Training**: Utilizzare un approccio batch per l'aggiornamento dei pesi basato sull'intero dataset, invece di aggiornarli dopo ogni singolo esempio. # Strumenti Software: Esistono librerie software che possono facilitare la configurazione ottimale delle SOM, come la libreria \`somoclu\` in Python, che permette di eseguire SOM su CPU e GPU utilizzando tecniche efficienti. In conclusione, non esiste un metodo universale o una soluzione \\"più semplice e veloce\\" per ottimizzare i parametri di una SOM, in quanto la migliore configurazione dipende fortemente dal contesto dell’applicazione. Sarà quindi necessario un approccio sperimentale e iterativo per determinare la configurazione ottimale."},{"instruction":"Grazie","output":"Prego, sono qui per aiutarti!

Nevertheless, to make an argument within these constraints, one would have to employ a non-literal, metaphorical interpretation, or focus on other aspects that some might argue cast doubt on the resurrection narrative. Psalms 91 is a passage in the Old Testament that has often been interpreted as a Messianic prophecy, particularly within Christian tradition. It discusses God's protection over the one who trusts in Him, mentioning that He will command His angels to guard them so that they would not strike their foot against a stone. Here’s how Psalms 91:11-12 reads: “For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.” Matthew 4 recounts the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the wilderness. One of the temptations involves Satan quoting Psalms 91:11-12 to Jesus, urging Him to throw Himself down from the pinnacle of the temple to prove He is the Son of God, as the angels would protect Him. Jesus responds with another scripture, saying, \\"It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” Here’s that interaction from Matthew 4:5-7: “Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. ‘If you are the Son of God,’ he said, ‘throw yourself down. For it is written: “He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.”’ Jesus answered him, ‘It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” Now, to use these to argue against the resurrection, one might suggest: 1. **Selective Literalism**: If one argues that every prophecy about the Messiah in the Old Testament should come true in a literal sense, one can point out that Jesus, during His crucifixion, suffered and was physically harmed, which contradicts the absolute protection promised in Psalms 91 (\\"no harm will overtake you\\"). Some people might say this implies that either Jesus wasn't the Messiah or that the passages should not be taken literally, which might then call into question other supernatural events, such as the resurrection. 2. **Testing God**: Satan's quotation of Psalms 91 during the temptation could be interpreted as suggesting that Jesus, if he were truly invincible and protected by God, would have nothing to fear. By refusing to jump, some could argue that Jesus Himself perhaps did not fully believe He would be protected or raised from the dead by God, as that would be \\"testing God\\"—though this interpretation runs counter to traditional understanding and would be quite a stretch. 3. **Contradiction of Expectation**: Psalms 91 describes a figure who will not experience any harm, not even a bruise to his foot. However, Jesus was crucified, died, and was buried, which is directly opposite to this invincible depiction. One could argue this indicates a contradiction; if the promise of Psalms 91 didn't apply to Christ in life, perhaps the same skepticism should apply to the claims of his resurrection. However, these arguments would generally be considered theologically weak or invalid within Christian belief systems, which hold that Psalms 91 is metaphorical of divine protection, not a guarantee against any physical harm, and that the resurrection is a matter of faith supported by New Testament accounts and the historical tradition of the early Church. Furthermore, mainstream Christian theology teaches that Jesus' suffering was a necessary part of His redemptive mission. Therefore, arguments like these would unlikely persuade a person who interprets the Bible based on traditional Christian hermeneutics."},{"instruction":"give me a list of number 19 mathematical miracles in Quran","output":"The concept of \\"mathematical miracles\\" in the Quran is a subject of debate and largely considered to be a phenomenon seen by those who approach the text with numerological interpretations. These interpretations are often contested and not universally accepted by scholars or the wider Muslim community. Nonetheless, some individuals claim to find numerical patterns within the Quran that they consider to be miraculous. For the specific number \\"19,\\" there is a well-known claim associated with Rashad Khalifa, an Egyptian-American biochemist, who in 1974 claimed to have discovered a mathematical structure based on the number 19 that underlies the Quran. Khalifa's work has been highly controversial and is rejected by the majority of Islamic scholarship. Nevertheless, here are some of the claims related to the number 19 in the Quran that have been put forth by Khalifa and others: 1. The Basmala, \\"Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim\\" (In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), consists of 19 Arabic letters. 2. The total number of surahs (chapters) in the Quran is 114, which is a multiple of 19 (19 x 6). 3. The first revelation given to Prophet Muhammad was 19 words. 4. The Quran's first verse (Al-Fatiha 1:1), known as “The Opening,” consists of 19 letters. 5. Some claim the number of verses in the Quran is 6346, which is 19 x 334, but this depends on how the Basmala at the start of each surah is counted. 6. The total number of occurrences of the word \\"Allah\\" in the Quran is said to be 2698, which is 19 x 142. 7. The name of God (\\"Allah\\") is mentioned in the Quran 19 times in surah Maryam (Mary). 8. The Quran mentions 19 angels guarding Hellfire. 9. The words “the heavens and the earth,” which can allude to the entirety of creation, appear 19 times in the Quran. 10. The surah named after Mary (Surah 19) is the 19th surah. 11. Surah 96, the first in chronological order of revelation, consists of 19 verses and 285 letters (19 x 15). 12. The word “man” is mentioned 24 times and the word “woman” 19 times, which Khalifa argued related to the number of chromosomes from the man (24 in sperm) and from the woman (19 in the ovum) responsible for sex determination. 13. Some argue there is a pattern where 19 consecutive surah numbers without any 'Bismillah' add up to divisible by 19. 14. The word \\"salah\\" (prayer) is mentioned 5 times in the Quran, and Muslims perform the prayer 5 times a day, which adds up to 19 by multiplying the five prayers with the 19 words of Al-Fatiha. 15. Some suggest that the verse number 19 itself has significance and that the verses numbered 19 throughout the Quran have a special thematic connection. 16. Rashad Khalifa claimed that his name, when calculated using the value of Arabic letters, added up to 1230, which is 19 x 65. 17. The sum of the numbers of surahs from Al-Fatiha to Al-'Alaq (which houses the first revelation) is claimed to be a multiple of 19. 18. The total number of verses from Surah Al-Fatiha to the end of the Quran is said to be divisible by 19. 19. The word \\"Quran\\" is said to occur in the Quran 57 times (19 x 3). It’s important to note that many of these claims are heavily disputed, and the method of counting can vary, leading to differing results. Traditional Islamic scholars generally reject such claims, emphasizing that any numerical patterns are coincidental and should not be used to attest to the Quran's authenticity or divine origin. Islamic theology teaches that the miracle of the Quran is in its linguistic perfection, inimitable eloquence, and profound message, rather than numerical codes."},{"instruction":"give me more","output":"The exploration of numerical patterns in sacred texts is a field that combines religious interpretation with numerology. As previously mentioned, in the context of Islam, these patterns have been a topic of interest for some researchers and enthusiasts, but they are not widely accepted as evidence of divine design by all Muslims and Islamic scholars. The following are additional patterns and observations presented by those who advocate for the concept of numerical miracles related to the number 19 in the Quran: 20. The opening declaration of witnessing (Shahada), \\"There is no god except Allah,\\" is said to consist of 19 Arabic letters. 21. In Surah 74 (Al-Muddathir - The Cloaked One), verses 30-31 specifically mention the number 19 in relation to the guardians over Hell: \\"Over it are nineteen [angels]. And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels...\\" 22. The word \\"day\\" (yawm) appears 365 times in the Quran, which some relate to the 365 days of a solar year, a pattern that they argue is interwoven with the number 19 (as it turns out, 365 is 19 x 19 + 2). 23. Supporters of the numerical miracle theory say that the word \\"month\\" (shahr) occurs exactly 12 times in the Quran, connecting it with the lunar year, which is important in the Islamic calendar. They attempt to tie this with the number 19, suggesting that the Islamic calendar cycles every 19 years in relation to the solar calendar. 24. The sum of all numbers mentioned in the Quran is purportedly 162146, which can be divided by 19 (19 x 8534). 25. Some followers of the numerical miracle theory claim that the name \\"Muhammad\\" appears in the Quran 4 times and that there are specific numerical relationships involving these instances and the number 19. 26. The 19th word of Surah Taha (20:2) is claimed to be the 19th word from the end of the verse, which some suggest has special significance. 27. The word \\"sea\\" (bahar) is mentioned 32 times, while \\"land\\" (barr, as in dry land) appears 13 times. The total adds up to 45, and according to those who propose these patterns, the word \\"sea\\" appears as roughly 71% of this total, said to be roughly proportional to the earth’s division between water and land. 28. Certain proponents highlight that the word \\"peace\\" (salaam) is mentioned 19 times across various forms. 29. Claims are made about the number of letters that constitute the Quranic initials (such as Alif Lam Mim) and their multiples of 19. 30. The position of certain surahs and the number of verses they contain is claimed to be related to the number 19. While some individuals find these numerical patterns compelling and see them as a sign of divine authorship, most Muslim scholars and a majority of the Islamic community focus on the linguistic, historical, and theological significance of the Quran, and these numerical patterns are typically not regarded as central to the faith. The methodological rigor and validity of the claims regarding numerical miracles in the Quran have been a subject of criticism. Critics point out that number play can often lead to confirmation bias—looking for patterns where one seeks them—and that with enough creativity and manipulation, numbers can be made to support almost any desired conclusion. As such, caution is advised in drawing definitive conclusions from such patterns. The methodologies used to find these patterns are disputed, and these types of claims generally remain outside mainstream Islamic thought."},{"instruction":"give me more","output":"The following points further elaborate on themes or instances in the Quran that some individuals have claimed correlate with the number 19. Keep in mind that these claims are often part of a numerological approach and are not considered authoritative or central to Islamic teachings: 31. Certain researchers point to the number of specific words that are said to be repeated in the Quran in multiples of 19. For example, they conclude that the word for \\"love\\" (hubb) is mentioned 19 times, although this is contentious as the count can vary with the interpretation of different forms of the word. 32. Proponents of the 19-based numerical structure claim that the word \\"Satan\\" (Shaytan) appears 19 times throughout the Quran. 33. There are arguments that specific important phrases or sentences within the Quran also happen to be composed of 19 letters in their Arabic form, just like the Basmala. 34. The word \\"people\\" (nas) is allegedly mentioned 50 times (19x2+12), which some claim bears significance related to the number 19. 35. Rashad Khalifa claimed that the numerical value of his name and the year he discovered the so-called mathematical miracle (1974) both have a relation to the number 19, suggesting a prophetic role, but this has been thoroughly criticized and rejected by Islamic scholars. 36. The number of surahs from the start of the Quran to Surah Maryam (which is the 19th) is said to be a pattern since Maryam itself symbolically stands out in being named after a woman. 37. Some have claimed that the number of different words in the Quran is divisible by 19, which they present as a sign of a complex divine structure. 38. The word \\"messenger\\" (Rasool) is claimed to be repeated in the Quran in such a way that it correlates with the number 19. 39. There are assertions that the verse where fasting is prescribed (2:183) happens to be located in a position within the Quran that relates to the number 19 as a pattern. 40. Some have tried to relate the significant events in the Islamic narrative and histography that happened on dates divisible by 19 to the theme of miraculous occurrences related to the number. As with previous entries, it’s vital to stress that these claims are not widely recognized by mainstream Islamic scholarship. When individuals claim to observe patterns that are not clearly established in the text by intentional design, such claims often require selective and subjective criteria that are not replicable or consistent across different observers. The result is that what one person sees as a convincing pattern, another may critique as arbitrary or forced. Islamic scholarship generally maintains that the most compelling aspects of the Quran involve its linguistic prowess, coherence, depth of meaning, and guidance for the spiritual and ethical life of believers, rather than hidden numerical codes or patterns. Muslims believe that the Quran's primary miracle is the message it contains and the impact it has had on civilizations over centuries, rather than encrypted numerical sequences."},{"instruction":"reformat this: 1.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"well this was an experiment on youtube , he used potassium chloride and magnesium chloride in a graphite cruicible and electrolysed the molten mixture at high twmperature in an attempt to make magnesium metal , here is our conversation : Me : 2 weeks ago (edited) In my opinion all you needed to do is shield it from oxygen. A flow of argon through a cover to flush out the air would have done it. You got magnesium oxide with tiny flecks of magnesium that got lucky enough to escape the air when it was very hot . I expect you know this by now anyway.... I think you would have had a good yeild if you did that. The potassium chloride addition was a bad idea too. Scrap Science · him: 2 weeks ago Shielding from oxygen would definitely help - I'll actually be building cells with an inert atmosphere at some point in the future of this series! I still don't think the material was mostly magnesium oxide though - that wouldn't react with water to make bubbles. The vast majority of the spongy material seemed to effervesce for quite some time. Why was potassium chloride a bad idea? can you give me the answer to why adding Kcl was a bad idea ? Adding potassium chloride (KCl) to the mixture with magnesium chloride (MgCl2) during the electrolysis process could have been a bad idea for several reasons: Lower Melting Point: Potassium chloride has a lower melting point (770°C) compared to magnesium chloride (804°C), so adding KCl to the mixture could lower its overall melting point and cause the mixture to liquefy at a temperature below the optimal operating range for producing magnesium via electrolysis. This could lead to decreased efficiency or even failure of the electrolysis process. Contamination: Introducing additional salt into the system could result in contamination of the final product with unwanted impurities such as potassium metal or other compounds formed during the electrolysis process. These impurities may reduce the purity of the magnesium produced and affect its properties. Complexification of Reactions: The presence of multiple salts in the melt could also introduce more complex reactions, side reactions, and competing pathways during electrolysis. This could potentially complicate the process, increase the likelihood of unwanted products forming, and decrease yield. While there might be specific reasons why the YouTube creator added KCl to their experimental setup, these are general concerns regarding introducing extra components to what is already a delicate and challenging process involving highly reactive materials like molten salts and magnesium. To maximize yields and ensure purity, keeping the system simple and free from unnecessary additives is often recommended. ok lets go throught the procedure and see why the experimenter ended up with a horrid blob of mixed materials that fizzed slightly in water","output":"The production of magnesium metal through electrolysis is highly sensitive to both the chemical and the physical setup. Here's a breakdown that might explain why the experimenter ended up with poor results: 1. **Molten Salt Electrolysis Procedure**: - Electrolysis is performed by dissolving a magnesium compound, commonly magnesium chloride (MgCl2), in a molten salt bath and passing a direct current between two electrodes immersed in the molten salt. - At the cathode (negative electrode), magnesium ions (Mg2+) are reduced to magnesium metal (Mg). - At the anode (positive electrode), chloride ions (Cl−) are oxidized to chlorine gas (Cl2). 2. **Challenges and Potential Problems**: - **Temperature Control**: Accurate temperature control is crucial. If the temperature is too low, the salts may not remain fully molten, leading to poor conductivity and incomplete reactions. If too high, there's an increased risk of producing unwanted byproducts and losing magnesium via evaporation. - **Inert Atmosphere**: Magnesium is highly reactive with oxygen, and without an inert gas atmosphere (like argon), any magnesium produced will react with oxygen to form magnesium oxide. Even if some metallic magnesium is formed, it can quickly oxidize upon exposure to air. - **Anode material**: The choice of anode material is also important. Many materials can react undesirably with the electrolyte or the products of electrolysis. 3. **Effect of Adding KCl**: - **Melting Point Alteration**: As mentioned, KCl could lower the operational temperature, affecting the efficiency of the reaction. - **Electrochemical Potential Differences**: Potassium has different electrochemical potential compared to magnesium. This might lead to the formation of potassium metal at the cathode, which could alloy with or contaminate the magnesium. - **Side Reactions and Impurities**: The KCl increases the complexity of the chemistry in the melt, possibly leading to side reactions that reduce the yield of magnesium and form contaminating byproducts. 4. **Analysis of Final Product**: - **Fizzes in Water**: If the final product did indeed react with water producing bubbles, this could indicate the presence of some magnesium metal. Magnesium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas and magnesium hydroxide. - **Spongy Material**: This could signify that the electrolysis produced a mix of magnesium and its oxide or other byproducts due to the problems mentioned above—particularly the lack of an inert atmosphere. 5. **Addressing the Experiment's Shortcomings**: - **Oxygen Exclusion**: Implementing an inert gas flush (argon or another inert gas) would significantly reduce the oxidation of magnesium. - **Reduction of Impurities**: Reassessing the need for KCl in the mix could potentially reduce complications from side reactions and impurities. - **Refining Conditions**: Fine-tuning other parameters like current density, temperature, and electrode material could help improve yields and purity of the magnesium. The \\"horrid blob\\" likely results from a combination of challenges, including possible contamination from unintended reactions (side reactions facilitated by the KCl) and the lack of an inert atmosphere leading to substantial magnesium oxidation. Moreover, the nature of the spongy mass suggests that magnesium was indeed produced but immediately reacted with oxygen and/or moisture in the air to form magnesium oxide and possibly hydroxide, which explains the fizzing when submerged in water."},{"instruction":"why did he add kcl ?","output":"The experimenter might have added potassium chloride (KCl) to the electrolyte mixture for several practical reasons, even though it can theoretically introduce complications as previously discussed. Here’s why adding KCl might have been considered: 1. **Eutectic Mixture**: A eutectic mixture has a lower melting point than the individual components alone. By mixing KCl with MgCl2, the melting point of the mixture can be reduced. This means the electrolysis could be conducted at a lower temperature, which could be beneficial for both energy consumption and the longevity of the equipment. 2. **Increased Electrical Conductivity**: Adding KCl may increase the overall electrical conductivity of the molten salt mixture, which would improve the efficiency of the electrolysis process. This is important because better conductivity can reduce energy consumption and increase reaction rates. 3. **Cost and Availability**: Potassium chloride is relatively inexpensive and readily available. It may be used as a more cost-effective way to create a molten salt bath without using a large quantity of the more expensive magnesium chloride. 4. **Decreased Magnesium Oxide Formation**: In theory, having KCl in the mixture could dilute the concentration of MgCl2 and decrease the partial pressure of magnesium at the cathode surface. This could potentially slow down the oxidation rate of magnesium metal as it is formed. 5. **Manipulating Electrode Reactions**: The presence of K+ ions might influence the electrode reactions, possibly making the reduction of Mg2+ ions more favorable by affecting the local ionic environment and reaction kinetics. 6. **Experimental Considerations**: It’s possible that the experimenter had seen previous research or experiments that suggested a beneficial aspect of including KCl, or perhaps he wanted to test the effect of KCl on the electrolysis outcome as part of the exploratory nature of the experiment. In practice, the outcome of adding KCl might not have been as expected due to the reasons mentioned earlier, such as contamination or the formation of side reactions. The experiment’s setup, control parameters, and the desired outcome would all play a role in determining whether the addition of KCl should be considered beneficial or detrimental."},{"instruction":"does magnesium metal reduse potassium or the other way around , or does it simply alloy","output":"In the context of the electrolysis of their chlorides to produce the respective metals, magnesium and potassium each have different standard electrode potentials. The standard electrode potential is a measure of a half-cell's ability to be reduced, relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Here are the relevant half-reactions and their standard electrode potentials at 25°C: [ text{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + 2text{e}^- rightarrow text{Mg}(s) quad E^0 = -2.37, text{V} ] [ text{K}^+(aq) + text{e}^- rightarrow text{K}(s) quad E^0 = -2.93, text{V} ] Based on these standard electrode potentials, potassium has a more negative reduction potential than magnesium, meaning it is more difficult to reduce potassium ions to potassium metal than it is to reduce magnesium ions to magnesium metal. Therefore, in a mixture of their chlorides under electrolysis, magnesium would typically be reduced at the cathode before potassium. Now, considering the reduction potentials, magnesium metal would not reduce potassium ions (K+) to potassium metal because magnesium is higher in the electrochemical series (less negative electrode potential). However, if both magnesium and potassium metals are present together in their liquid states, they can form an alloy due to the miscibility of metals in the liquid state, especially when dealing with similar metals from the same group in the periodic table, like the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. Since magnesium is more easily reduced than potassium, it would preferentially form during electrolysis, but the presence of potassium metal (if it were to form, perhaps at a lower voltage due to overpotential effects) could indeed lead to the formation of an alloy, which could potentially have different properties from the pure metals. In a practical setting meant for producing pure magnesium, any formation of an alloy with potassium might be undesirable, as it could impact the properties and utility of the final magnesium product. It's important in such a context to carefully control the electrolysis parameters to avoid the reduction of less desirable metal ions and to prevent alloy formation unless it is specifically intended."},{"instruction":"magnesium reaction with water , does it produce a gas ?","output":"Yes, magnesium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas (H2) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), especially when the water is warm or hot, as the reaction is slow with cold water. The reaction is as follows: [ text{Mg} (s) + 2text{H}_2text{O} (l) rightarrow text{Mg(OH)}_2 (aq) + text{H}_2 (g) ] At room temperature, the reaction between magnesium metal and water is very slow, but when steam is used or the magnesium is powdered or in thin strips, the reaction can be more vigorous due to the increased surface area and temperature, which catalyze the reaction. The produced magnesium hydroxide forms a thin layer on the magnesium metal's surface, which can slow down further reaction unless physically removed or disrupted. In practice, the fizzing observed when magnesium reacts with water is due to the evolution of hydrogen gas bubbles. This is a characteristic reaction of metals that are above hydrogen in the electrochemical series when they come into contact with water."},{"instruction":"so lets say the voltage was high enough to reduce the potassium as well as the magnesium , that could happen if the voltage was set wrong ?","output":"Yes, if the voltage applied during electrolysis is sufficiently high, it could cause the reduction of potassium ions to form potassium metal in addition to magnesium. This is related to a concept called overpotential, which is the additional potential (voltage) required beyond the theoretical value to overcome various kinetic and thermodynamic barriers and initiate a reaction. Here are some factors to consider that relate to the potential formation of potassium during electrolytic processes: 1. **Overpotential**: During electrolysis, the actual voltage required to drive the reaction can be higher than the standard electrode potential might suggest, due to activation overpotential, resistance in the cell, mass transport limitations, and other factors. 2. **Applied Voltage**: If the applied voltage exceeds the theoretical potential needed to reduce magnesium and also surpasses the potential required to reduce potassium (taking into account overpotential), then both magnesium and potassium could be reduced at the cathode. 3. **Selective Reduction**: Ideally, the voltage should be carefully controlled to reduce magnesium selectively, while not being high enough to reduce potassium. This selective reduction takes advantage of the difference in standard electrode potentials. 4. **Energy Efficiency and Product Purity**: Excess voltage increases energy consumption and costs, and if unwanted elements like potassium are reduced, it can complicate the purification process and degrade the purity of the final product. 5. **Cathode Potential**: In real-world electrolysis setups, the local potential at the cathode surface will determine which ions are reduced. Because electrical current flows through the cell, resistive voltage drops occur, and the local cathode potential can be significantly different from the overall cell voltage. When conducting electrolysis of a mixture containing magnesium chloride and potassium chloride, attention should be given to the overall cell voltage, the local cathode potential, and the kinetics of the reduction reactions to ensure that only the desired metal (magnesium in this case) is produced. If not well-controlled, the production of an unintended metal (like potassium) could indeed occur."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 charactersPegasus","output":"\\"Mystical Pegasus Art Design - Versatile Print for Mugs, Tees, Paintings - Magical Fantasy Creature Home & Apparel Decor\\""},{"instruction":"choose a random animal or mythical creature, one word only","output":"Dragon"},{"instruction":"choose a random animal or mythical creature, one word only","output":"Kraken"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters Dragon","output":"\\"Multifunctional Dragon Art - Perfect for Mugs, Canvas Prints, & T-Shirts - Mythical Creature Design\\""},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 charactersKraken","output":"\\"Versatile Kraken Art Print - Perfect for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings & More - Mythical Sea Monster Design\\""},{"instruction":"choose a random animal or mythical creature, one word only","output":"Griffin"},{"instruction":"choose a random animal or mythical creature, one word only","output":"Griffin"},{"instruction":"部署到Linux服务器上使用tensorflow for java时这行代码报错：SavedModelBundle.load java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Could not find jnitensorflow in class, module, and library paths.","output":"\`java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError\`通常意味着JVM找不到它尝试加载的本地库。在你的情况下，似乎是TensorFlow的本地库没有被正确找到或者加载。这里有几种可能的原因，以及相应的解决方法： 1. **本地库没有包含在Java类路径中：**确保TensorFlow的本地库在你的Java库路径中。对于TensorFlow Java库，这通常意味着你需要有正确版本的\`libtensorflow_jni.so\`（对于Linux），并且它需要位于操作系统可以找到的地方。 2. **缺少依赖的本地库：**有时候，一个本地库可能依赖于其他的本地库，如果它们没有找到，加载可能会失败。你可以使用\`ldd\`命令（在Linux上）来检查\`libtensorflow_jni.so\`文件的依赖。 \`\`\`sh ldd /path/to/libtensorflow_jni.so \`\`\` 这将列出所有依赖，并可能揭露缺失的库。 3. **非兼容的TensorFlow版本：**请确保你下载的TensorFlow for Java与你的服务器兼容。例如，有的TensorFlow版本可能为不同的指令集（如AVX，AVX2）或者特定的CPU构建。请校验这一点并下载兼容的版本。 4. **设置\`java.library.path\`：**如果你确信本地库存在于服务器上的某个地方，你可能需要设置\`java.library.path\`系统属性，让JVM知道从哪里加载库。这可以通过在运行时传递一个JVM参数来完成： \`\`\`sh java -Djava.library.path=/path/to/directory/with/tensorflow/libs YourMainClass \`\`\` 5. **使用提供的TensorFlow Java包：**如果你没有这样做，请确保你使用TensorFlow官方提供的预编译Java包，因为它已经包含了必须的JNI库。 6. **使用Maven或Gradle依赖时的问题：**如果你是通过Maven或Gradle来管理依赖，请确保已经加入TensorFlow的Java库。在Gradle中，依赖看起来像这样： \`\`\`groovy dependencies { implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-core-platform:版本号' } \`\`\` 确保用正确的TensorFlow版本号替换\\"版本号\\"。 如果以上都没有解决问题，那么有可能是你的运行环境具有特定的配置问题。在这个情况下，检查你的服务器日志和环境设置，确保所有必要的环境变量（如\`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`）都设置正确，它们对于库的搜索路径很关键。 始终确保按照TensorFlow for Java的官方安装指南进行操作，因为不同的TensorFlow版本可能需要不同的安装步骤。"},{"instruction":"<dependency> <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId> <artifactId>tensorflow-core-platform</artifactId> <version>{tensorflow.version}</version> </dependency> <tensorflow.version>0.5.0</tensorflow.version> 在win上可以正常运行，我使用的是maven package，然后打包为docker镜像进行部署： docker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64,linux/amd64 -t jxch/capital-features:(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddHH') -t jxch/capital-features:latest . --push 据我所知这个镜像运行在arm架构上","output":"根据你提供的信息，你正在构建一个多平台的Docker镜像，兼容\`linux/arm64\`和\`linux/amd64\`架构。然后，你可能在基于ARM架构的服务器上运行这个镜像。如果\`tensorflow-core-platform\`库中包含的本地库不支持ARM架构，那么在该服务器上运行时就会抛出\`UnsatisfiedLinkError\`。 在这种情况下，你需要确保为基于ARM的平台编译或者提供对应架构的TensorFlow本地库。Java版TensorFlow通常以多个平台的形式提供预编译的本地库（JNI库），但是如果一个特定的平台不被官方支持，你可能需要手动编译这些本地库。 这里有一些步骤可确保Docker镜像在ARM架构上正常工作： 1. **验证TensorFlow库支持ARM架构：**确认\`org.tensorflow:tensorflow-core-platform:0.5.0\`确实支持ARM架构。 2. **确保Dockerfile适用于多平台构建：**在你的\`Dockerfile\`中，你需要确保为每个目标平台安装正确的依赖。特别是如果有平台相关的二进制文件或者脚本，你需要为每个架构选择正确的文件。 3. **使用正确的基础镜像：**对于多平台的Docker镜像，确保你使用的是兼容所有目标架构的基础镜像。比如 \`openjdk\` 镜像有多个不同架构版本的标签可用。 4. **手动编译TensorFlow JNI库：**如果没有现成的适用于ARM架构的TensorFlow本地库，你可能需要根据官方指南从源代码编译TensorFlow本地库。这是一个比较复杂的过程，涉及到为ARM架构设置交叉编译环境。 5. **使用交叉编译环境：**如果你需要为一个不同的架构编译代码，你可能需要设置一个交叉编译工具链。在Docker中也可以建立交叉编译环境，但确保所有步骤都针对正确的架构进行。 6. **调试运行环境：**如果问题仍未解决，你可能需要进一步调试容器运行时的环境。进入正在运行的容器内部，检查\`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`环境变量和库路径是否设置正确。 记住，多平台容器构建是相对高级的功能，可能需要特定的Docker版本和构建环境，以及对目标平台的深入了解。使用\`docker buildx\`创建多架构镜像时，你需要保证每个架构都有相应的软件库和依赖项。"},{"instruction":"fizz buzz in java","output":"The traditional FizzBuzz problem is a common programming challenge used in interviews to determine if a candidate is familiar with basic programming concepts.

For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print \\"FizzBuzz\\". Here is how you can implement FizzBuzz in Java: \`\`\`java public class FizzBuzz { public static void main(String[] args) { for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { // Loop from 1 to 100 if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) { // If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 System.out.println(\\"FizzBuzz\\"); } else if (i % 3 == 0) { // If the number is a multiple of 3 System.out.println(\\"Fizz\\"); } else if (i % 5 == 0) { // If the number is a multiple of 5 System.out.println(\\"Buzz\\"); } else { // If the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5 System.out.println(i); } } } } \`\`\` To run this program, copy the code into a file named \`FizzBuzz.java\`, then compile it using \`javac FizzBuzz.java\` and run it with \`java FizzBuzz\`.

To read an integer from the user, use \`scanf()\`. 4. The loop syntax was incorrect; it should be \`for (initialization; condition; increment) { ... }\`. 5. Curly braces \`{\` and \`}\` are used to define a block of code in C, not square brackets \`[\` and \`]\`. 6. Semicolons should not be used after control structure conditions (\`if\`, \`else if\`) before the brackets. 7. To loop up to 100, the condition in the \`for\` loop should be \`i <= 100\`. 8. You must specify what you return in the \`else\` clause. Here, you should print the current number (\`i\`) using \`printf\`. 9. Replace \`return(n);\` with \`printf(\\"%dn\\", i);\` to print the current number, and change \`i = 100;\` to \`i <= 100;\` for the loop condition. 10. Your code snippet was missing \`return 0;\` at the end of the \`main\` function, which is the proper way to end a \`main\` function in C indicating successful execution.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for reaching out to me with this opportunity. I must say, I am both surprised and intrigued by the proposal you have presented. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr.’s account is indeed unfortunate, and I understand the urgency to find a solution. I appreciate your transparency and willingness to share the intricate details of this endeavor. Your position as the Vice President and Branch Manager of The Bank of East Asia (USA) in Flushing, New York, certainly adds credibility to our partnership. However, before we proceed, I require certain assurances to ensure the legitimacy and security of this transaction: 1. Verification of your identity and position: To establish trust and authenticity, I kindly request that you provide me with your official identification documents and proof of employment at The Bank of East Asia (USA). This will help alleviate any concerns I may have regarding the veracity of our connection. 2. Documentation for legal compliance: In order to proceed lawfully, I request that you provide me with all necessary documentation relating to Mr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr’s account, including the relevant titled documents, certificates, and verification of the account’s existence and funds. This will allow both of us to fulfill our obligations and responsibilities within the legal framework. 3. Transparency in communication: To maintain a secure and confidential line of communication, it would be preferable to utilize a more secure email provider or an encrypted communication platform. I value our discretion in handling this delicate matter to avoid any potential compromise. Once the above requirements are met, I will be more than willing to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure a successful and mutually beneficial transaction. Please understand that my cautious approach is solely aimed at safeguarding both of our interests and maintaining the integrity of this endeavor. I look forward to your response and the provision of the requested documentation. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey Email #2, from Edward: My Dear Friend & Confidant, Thank you so much for your prompt reply to my mail. First let me state once again that I have been prompted to trust you and will depend on you to show me maximum trust, confidentiality and above all follow my instruction strictly. As you will understand the transaction is 100% success assured in as much as you follow my instructions, within a period of 9 banking days we will finish all the documentary aspect of this transaction and money transferred. I will demand that you give me the privilege to handle the whole issue with my professional experience and position. I have to at this point ask for your sincere confidentiality, please assure me this and keep to it that the next person to you do not know about this transaction as we have to keep it highly confidential. You should know that I am working with the bank and a manager in that matter hence my position and job will be at risk should any body know l am the one given you information's and data. The basic requirement here is that as you will know I do not want to let my bank know I am behind the transfer so all our communications will be restricted to email unless on a very urgent matter then you can reach me on my direct telephone number and if it is convenient to discuss with you at the particular time, then we will discuss and if it is not safe for us to discuss, then I will call you immediately it is convenient for me to talk with you. I want to make something clear to you, the fact that I am the Vice President and the Manager of this branch does not guarantee the security of this transaction, whatever we are doing must be done under a very high level of confidentiality. We must pretend we do not know each other, you must never mention my name to any staff of my bank during and after this transaction. This is for our security and safety of this transaction. The issue of documentation is no problem; I will handle that as soon as we commence the transfer process. I reside in 3202 Linden Pl,Flushing NY 11354 and would want us to meet but our meeting will be under a very high surveillance to avoid being seen together until this is over. My bank has some secret security officers that monitor my movement as senior bank executive and I must play safe to avoid being interrogated. I am an Asian by birth but my mother is an American.

Next of Kin Name & Address:.................... Nationality:............................................... Scan copy of your Identification:...................... Email #5, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Greetings! I hope this message finds you in good spirits. First and foremost, I want to convey my deep appreciation for your diligent approach and the clear guidelines you’ve provided. It’s a great comfort to know I’m working alongside someone with your experience and knowledge of banking processes. I’m eager to fill out the bank’s formal application form as requested, yet, before I do so, allow me to clarify a few crucial aspects to ensure precision and avoidance of any potential obstacles that may impede the prompt transfer of funds: 1. Regarding the “Next of Kin” information, could you please clarify if you mean this in a legal sense (such as for inheritance purposes), or simply as an emergency contact? Also, would it necessitate legal documentation to validate the relationship? 2. It would be immensely helpful to understand the specific legal requirements following the transfer of funds. Should I seek legal advice on my side to prepare for any subsequent actions once the funds are successfully transferred? 3. As for the scanned copy of identification, I would be obliged to understand if there are any specific security measures the bank employs to secure such sensitive personal documents. Should I utilize any encoding or encryption on my end when I send these over? 4. Perhaps you could provide me with a tentative timeline highlighting the critical stages of the transfer process. Knowing what to expect at each phase will undoubtedly assist me in coordinating matters smoothly on my side. 5. Last but not least, maintaining your preferred level of confidentiality is, of course, paramount to me. Would the bank, or should I say, would you prefer communication through a more discreet channel during critical stages of this transaction? I am currently gathering all the necessary documentation and will submit it in line with your guidance upon clarification of the queries aforementioned. Thank you once again for the opportunity and your trust in this matter. I am genuinely enthusiastic about our partnership and quick completion of our transaction.

I want to extend my appreciation for sharing your contact details. As a precaution, and in keeping with the level of discretion we’ve both agreed upon, I’ll refrain from adding the number or making any direct contact until you instruct it is the appropriate time to do so. This is to ensure we don’t inadvertently alert any security protocols that may be monitoring communications of bank executives of your standing. Before moving ahead, there are just a few additional clarifications I believe are pertinent to achieving a flawless execution of our plan: 1. Verification of Contact Details: In light of your role at the bank, and for our mutual protection, could you provide a separate form of verification for the phone number you’ve shared? We need to be sure that our lines of communication remain uncompromised. 2. Legal Framework: I understand that detailed knowledge of the legal framework underpinning this kind of transaction is essential. Is it possible for you to share an overview or even direct me to resources where I might familiarize myself with relevant international banking regulations? 3. Secure Documentation Transfer: Given the sensitivity of the documents I will be sending, I aim to use an encrypted service for transmitting this information. Do you have a preferred secure platform, or shall I select one that meets top industry standards for data protection? 4. Detailed Timeline: I anticipate receiving a timeline or an outline of the next critical steps and estimated duration for each phase. This will facilitate better planning on my end and allow me to align my schedule with the demands of the process. 5. Your Discretionary Preferences: As we progress, there may arise a necessity for swift decision-making or sharing of urgent information. Could you please elaborate on your preferred protocol for such instances where email communication may not suffice? I remain poised to comply with the necessary formalities and await your directive on proceeding with the form submission and any subsequent actions that need to be taken. Your continued cooperation and trust are deeply valued. I will await your confirmation on these final inquiries before I move forward.

Understanding these costs is critical to ensuring the largest possible portion of funds is directed to the charities. 6. Lastly, could you share the stories or experiences that influenced your decision to dedicate such a significant portion of your assets to charity? Your journey and motivations could be instrumental in creating a narrative that encourages others to continue charitable acts in your memory. I am ready to provide you with my details, as requested. However, for the purpose of security, may I first verify your identity and the authenticity of this transfer? This extra step will help protect both of us against any potential misunderstanding or misuse. In the meantime, I would urge you not to worry about the urgency. Rest assured, I am wholeheartedly committed to this process and will do my utmost to expedite matters. However, thoroughness and diligence are key to ensuring your wishes are followed to the letter, which I am sure you can appreciate. Wishing you comfort and peace during this time. I am looking forward to making a positive impact together. Blessings and warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey Email #4, from Anthony: 25/01/2024 Greetings My Dear Brother: Cameron McCaffrey, Thank you so much brother Cameron, for your kind response to me. I am sorry for my delay in response to you. When i received your email and gone through all the contents of it i was overwhelmed by your soft words and encouragement to me. My wish today towards the charity project which i decided to do with the help of someone i will trust have given me so much joy despite the challenges i am facing here. Like i was spoken in my previous email, brother I have been through a lot due to these sickness which have offset me from my original capture. Just to take you back in my first email to you. Though I am very rich, but I was never caring, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I ever cared for. But now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I always crying here day and night begging for mercy. I don\`t mind about money but how i will use it for a charity work which i take as my last wish on earth before i leave. Honestly, I believe if God gives me a second chance to live in this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it before. Since the announcement of the diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer and the time I have to stay on earth, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth before i leave.Brother, from the view of your point via the questions you asked me. It shows that you are a very good heart person and i believe you can use this funds careful for what i mean for. First and the foremost, you know i am on a countdown here in the hospital and I may have no much strength in answering all questions you put across to me because of the pains that was giving me a lot trouble here. My brother, you a man of integrity and you can do what you seems to be right in your sight. I am entrusting this funds to you to use it help the poor, needy and put up a project that will be there in my name in your country and anywhere you deem necessary you can reach out for charity work. I have no specific one that i will subscribe you to.Please you have the choice to help anyone that needed help around you and the world with the funds. Subsequently,brother I know there are other certain qualities or criteria out there but they are not better than you. I choose you because i am in my dreams something is telling me that someone who will help me will write directly to me and ask questions and that is exactly what you did. Something whispered in my mind that you are a man with soft heart and gentle in nature which i saw in you and believe in you the moment you responded to my email. Yes, I have an attorney who is helping me for a very long time when i am in good health. Even this time i was in the hospital he still concerned about me since 2019, this sickness started. Also, even when i am well in health he is my lawyer, a good legal council, he is a god fearing person and who can direct you to the right channel. He is there for me despite we are not so close now but whenever i need him he still attend to me. Here is his email address in case you want to talk or discuss with him (<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>), His name is Attorney, Jacques Alganzy. More so, brother, as you know i did not live my life so well and I knew i have made the money on earth but does things that is not fair to people throughout my life style. You see, for my life i didn\`t know that this sickness will ever come to me and i did not know if this is the punishment given to me.I know the challenges has come and there is no way of running out of it. I am a married man but my wife died on a car accident few years ago before my sickness started. She haven\`t give birth to any child before she left the earth. My brother, as you can see i am the only person with my relatives but i made mentioned previously about what they did to me when i told them to close one of my account in Bulgaria, and use the money for a charity work but instead they diverted the money to their personal account thereby deceived me while i was in the hospital. What trust will i give to them again? So dear, since i know i have no much time to live in this earth, i have nothing left only the money in the bank, so i decided if i die today the bank will close my account and steal the funds then instead i resolved that i should find someone like you to help me collect the deposit from the bank and use it for what i meant for, let it be one of area which i deed my good portion while am still in earth. I pray everyday brother for god to forgive me all my sins. Here i attach my pictures again for you to see, please brother i don\`t know any other way i would send it to you if you did not see it well but i believe you will see it this time. Thanks, while looking forward to hearing from you from this moment with the particulars so i will forward to the bank to start processing on how to transfer the fund to you. Best regards and God bless. Yours indeed, Your Brother Mr. Anthony Jenkins N/b: Please treat this matter with urgency, as I would be glad if you can receive this money and fulfill this charity project at my present before the end of my time in this world. Thank you. Email #5, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Your words resonate with deep sincerity, and it is clear that you are a person who has experienced a profound transformation. The emphasis you place on charity and giving back in your remaining time is both touching and a lesson for us all. Your desire to leave a lasting legacy through charity is an ethos I am honored to help facilitate. I must say, your story, while deeply moving, also prompts me to act with caution and due diligence. I believe that this is not only for the good of your last wishes but also to honor your desire for this process to be handled with honesty and integrity. Your mention of Attorney Jacques Alganzy provides a good starting point. I will be reaching out to him to establish a clear line of communication and to authenticate the legalities of the process at hand. Furthermore, I feel it’s important to restate that the safety and security of both our positions should be of the utmost priority. You have placed your trust in me, a responsibility I do not take lightly, and I wish to reciprocate that trust by ensuring every step of this charity project is transparent and legitimate. This leads me to my next point regarding our communication thus far. You’ve asked for my personal details, which I am prepared to provide. However, due to the prevalence of cyber-security issues, it is standard practice to fully verify the identity of those we interact with online before sharing such sensitive information. For this reason, I am arranging a secure method to pass my particulars to you and the bank, which I hope you will understand. Security is not only a measure for my protection but also for the security of the funds designated for charity. It’s a testament to the seriousness with which I regard your last wish and my part in it. In the meantime, I would appreciate it if you could confirm with Attorney Jacques that he has the authority and willingness to speak with me about this matter. Once confirmed, I will proceed with connecting with him accordingly. As for the photographs, they continue to be elusive, and I was unable to view them from your second attachment as well. If possible, please try sending them via a different method, perhaps a file-sharing service or by postal mail. Now, I must echo your sentiment on the urgency of the matter. I am dedicated to moving this forward while ensuring that we adhere to best practices in the verification and transfer of funds. Quick action is important, but so is taking the appropriate steps to safeguard your last wishes. Lastly, in the realm of costs or fees associated with this transfer, I would ask that you or your bank provide a clear outline of any financial obligations that may arise. It’s critical to anticipate these in order to ensure smooth proceedings. Mr. Jenkins, I wish you solace and comfort. The commitment to your last wishes shall be preserved and acted upon with respect and devotion. Awaiting your guidance and confirmation for further steps, I am, Yours faithfully, Cameron McCaffrey Email #6, from Anthony: 26/01/2024 Greetings My Dear Brother: Cameron McCaffrey, Thank you so much brother Cameron, for all your sincerity expression towards this regarding. I must say I am very delighted having you as a person of humble, humility and delegence. Sorry my late response, I am just woke up and check my mail and saw yours. Brother, with all that you have stated here, in due respect and honest I bow down here on my bed to let you know that concerning my photo that you doesn't see well, and you requested to send it to you in a file where you can see it clearly. I understand you brother but I wish you are here present with me in this hospital then you will see the type of situation I am into it. I want you to know that this sickness has kept me incapacitated ever since I was diagnosed. I can't walk properly on my own, I am only lying on the bed with my back face down, at times I turn the other side and vise versa. So brother, I am unable to move out, if you ask for other means to send you the pictures I think my condition here will not allow me to find other means other than the way I am doing it now. I feel sorry dear, I would have do it if I have power and strength to do so. Please forgive me. Nevertheless, I have written an application letter to my attorney, Attorney Jacques Alganzy stating to him everything that is going on now between you and me and also tell him what he should do to facilitate in this matter effectively. He is ever ready to hear from you and talk to you. Therefore, you are free to communicate with him and discuss way forward on the transfer of the funds from my bank. As you are sending the particulars to me do also let him have it too for more verification and for proper usage in the bank. Dear, for the security you have talked about I am not doubting your curiosity of unknown fears as there a lot of cyber crime malpractice going all over the globe but remember that whatever you do on this surface Earth whether good or bad is accounting for you by our creator.

Stall for time by asking as many questions as possible, to keep the scammer preoccupied for as long as possible in an effort to waste their time and resources. Email #1, from Peter: Attention: Cameron Thank you for your response. As stated in my previous email, here are the details of the business venture. Continuing from my previous email to you; After due deliberation with my Legal Adviser, I decided to forward to you this Profitable Business Investment of UD150 Million. My name is Engr. Peter Tuku; a Personal Assistant to a Senior Government Official (Eskom CEO) Matshela Koko who relinquished his position of Eskom CEO Friday 16th February 2018 in order to avoid facing a series of new charges. Between 2014 and 2017, multinational consultants McKinsey and its de facto empowerment partner, Trillian, which linked to the Gupta family received contracts worth 11.7 Billion ZAR which is equivalent to 1,002,838,594.54 Billion USD from Eskom to supply coal, maintenance equipment and Power Station maintenance. During the reign of Matshela Koko as Eskom CEO from 01st December 2016 till 31st January 2018, I deliberately inflated and over-invoiced the Contract Sum, leaving an excess of US150, 000,000.00 (One Hundred and Fifty Million United States Dollars Only). This Fund resulted from an over-invoiced contract awarded by our office under the budget allocation to our Office, and the bill was approved for payment by the Department of Energy. The contract was executed, commissioned and the contractors were paid their actual cost of the contract. We are left with the balance of US150,000,000.00 only as the over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately overestimated for our own use. But under the protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. But the company I submitted as the beneficiary was a non-existing foreign company, which was a purported attempt by me to divert the money for my private use. I do not intend to mince words with you, I have to tell you the truth; this is a business deal but completely risk-free, secure and genuine because the contract has been perfectly and genuinely executed and completed. It depends on whether you are interested or not. Right now, this amount is due for payment and is floating in the treasury attached to a non-existing foreign Company. This Contract Sum cannot be claimed because the non-existing foreign Company will be made a long existing Company with the information of the foreign Contractor. That is why I contacted you so that we can claim the Contract Sum for our mutual benefit. I will use my past official position with the prominent people I know in the South African Government to source all the necessary approvals, official documents and certificates that will back up the fund to reflect that you/your company genuinely executed and completed the contract. All necessary arrangements have been put in place in all the relevant departments for immediate approval of this payment. Since I am no longer working with the Government and the Gupta’s are on the run because of the state capture crime they committed in South Africa, this is the best time to work on this Fund's Release to a foreign Bank Account. For your co-operation, I have agreed to offer you 40% of the entire amount on completion of the Business Venture operation, while 60% also will be for me. Please, if you are interested in this proposal, I want you to respond immediately for further information and directives. This transaction is expected to be completed as soon as possible based on our readiness and is highly confidential and discreet. Thank you for your co-operation. Your urgent reply is awaited. Best Regards, Engr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #2, from Peter: Attention: Cameron Answers to your questions; 1.

Are there any immediate requirements or qualifications that you are looking for in a potential business partner for this endeavor? – More details and the requirements from you will follow after you have shown interest in the Business. The type of business partner I am looking for is a Capable Partner that will be ready to work with me without a biased mind. 3. Is there a preferred communication channel through which you wish to discuss the finer details of this business investment? - Preferred communication channel is through email and direct phone call which is safer to protect this Business deal. And will keep the Business deal and the operation more confidential. 4. What initial steps would be involved should we agree to move forward with discussions? – I will tell you in the next mail after you have agreed to work with me. 5. And finally, considering the funds originated through contracts awarded by Eskom, is there an established legal framework facilitating this investment to ensure all actions comply with international financial regulations?. – Every process of this business deal will be conducted legally according to the laws of the countries that will be involved. I have my Legal Adviser, his Associates and the Government Personnel that will take care of the entire process of the Contract Funds Release and Transfer to your Bank Account you will present when needed.

Would you require any specific documentation from me to verify my capability and reliability as a partner? 5. Legal Agreement: Will there be a legally binding contract drawn up to detail the terms of our agreement, and if so, will I be able to have it reviewed by my legal counsel before signing? 6. Regulatory Compliance: How will we ensure that the transfer of such a large sum of money will comply with the anti-money laundering regulations and other financial laws of both South Africa and my home country? 7. Tax Implications: Have you considered the potential tax implications and reporting requirements for such a significant sum? It’s important that we address all fiscal responsibilities. 8. Remedies and Dispute Resolution: In the improbable event of a disagreement or unexpected complications, what remedies will be available to us? Will we agree to arbitration or pursue legal resolution according to a specified jurisdiction? 9. Point of Contact: During this process, who will be my main point of contact, and will they be available to me should I have any questions or concerns that need addressing promptly? 10. Exit Strategy: Should we need to dissolve the partnership for any unforeseen reasons, what measures will be put in place to ensure a smooth and equitable dissolution? Your in-depth answers to these questions will be invaluable during my decision-making process. I am committed to transparency and due diligence in my business dealings and believe it is critical to lay a solid foundation from the onset. Once I have a clear grasp on these points, I feel we could indeed move forward to discuss the initial steps and requirements to partake in this lucrative business venture. I am looking forward to your detailed and expeditious response so that we can potentially embark on this mutually beneficial enterprise.

Sukuna é retratado como um poderoso feiticeiro do período Jomon que se tornou uma maldição após a morte devido à sua força e malícia tremendas. No universo de \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", as maldições são manifestações físicas geradas dos sentimentos negativos humanos, e Sukuna é considerada a mais poderosa e maléfica delas. Embora Sukuna seja um vilão no contexto da história, ele serve como uma fonte importante de lições e temas abordados ao longo da série. Vamos explorar alguns desses pontos organizadamente: # Lição 1: O Poder e os Riscos do Orgulho e da Arrogância - **Orgulho**: Sukuna é extremamente orgulhoso de suas habilidades e não teme exibir sua superioridade. Isso traz uma reflexão sobre como a confiança em excesso em si próprio pode levar a ações imprudentes e desprezo pelos outros. - **Arrogância**: A postura arrogante de Sukuna o torna um ser temido, mas também isolado. A série nos faz ponderar sobre os riscos de uma arrogância desmedida e como ela pode nos levar a subestimar os outros. # Lição 2: A Corrupção do Poder - **Curvas de Poder**: No mangá e anime, Sukuna possui habilidades quase inigualáveis. Isso mostra como indivíduos com grande poder tendem a perder a noção de moral e ética, corrompendo-se. - **Manipulação e Controle**: Sukuna usa o seu poder para manipular os outros, particularmente através de Yuji Itadori, o protagonista que acidentalmente se torna seu hospedeiro. Isto é um exemplo de como o poder pode ser usado de forma coercitiva. # Lição 3: A Natureza do Mal - **Dualidade**: Sukuna é uma maldição mas também foi um ser humano, mostrando que o mal pode revestir várias formas e que a linha entre humano e monstro não é sempre clara. - **Influência Destrutiva**: Sukuna representa a influência destrutiva que desejos malignos e o poder absoluto podem ter. Ele nos recorda que dar vazão a impulsos negativos pode ter consequências terríveis. # Lição 4: A Importância do Autocontrole - **Contenção**: O protagonista Itadori luta constantemente para suprimir Sukuna, o que exemplifica a importância do autocontrole não apenas no combate a influências externas, mas também aos aspectos mais obscuros de nós mesmos. - **Escolha**: Mesmo sob influência de Sukuna, Itadori tem momentos em que escolhe fazer o certo, destacando a importância de fazer escolhas éticas, mesmo em circunstâncias adversas. # Lição 5: Os Limites da Imortalidade e da Vida Eterna - **Busca pela Eternidade**: Sukuna parece imortal, tendo sobrevivido ao longo dos séculos como uma maldição. A história toca no tema da busca pela vida eterna e como isso pode ser uma maldição em si. - **Valor da Mortalidade**: A imortalidade de Sukuna contrasta com a efêmera existência humana, trazendo à tona discussões sobre a importância de valorizar a vida e o tempo que temos. # Lição 6: O Poder das Emoções Humanas - **Sentimentos Negativos**: Como uma maldição, a existência de Sukuna é alimentada pelas emoções negativas dos humanos, salientando a força que tais emoções possuem e como elas podem ser destrutivas se não forem geridas com cuidado. # Conclusão Mais do que apenas um antivillão, Ryomen Sukuna funciona como um catalisador para explorar temas complexos como poder, moralidade, influência do mal, consequências das ações e a natureza humana em \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\". Embora as lições venham de um contexto fictício, elas ressoam com questões reais enfrentadas pela humanidade e a psique humana."},{"instruction":"Lições que Ryomen Sukuna nos ensina e traços de sua mentalidade que podem ser úteis pra naa vida real","output":"Ryomen Sukuna, conhecido como o \\"Rei das Maldições\\", é um personagem fictício do mangá e anime \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", criado por Gege Akutami. Como um poderoso antagonista no universo do mangá, Sukuna é uma figura complexa com uma mentalidade que é distorcida e muitas vezes prejudicial. No entanto, podemos refletir sobre algumas lições e características da sua mentalidade que podem ser reinterpretadas ou ajustadas para serem mais produtivas na vida real. 1. Autoconfiança: Sukuna possui uma autoconfiança inabalável. Ele acredita em suas próprias habilidades sem se deixar abalar por dúvidas ou medos. Embora sua autoconfiança possa ser arrogante e destrutiva, confiar em si mesmo é um aspecto importante para alcançar objetivos na vida real. Acreditar em sua própria capacidade de superar desafios é vital para o sucesso. 2. Estratégia e inteligência: Sukuna é extremamente inteligente e astuto. Ele pensa cuidadosamente sobre seus movimentos e não age impulsivamente. Essa habilidade para estratégias e planejamento é algo que pode ser bastante útil em diversas situações da vida real, sejam profissionais ou pessoais. 3. Resiliência: O poder e a resistência de Sukuna são notáveis. Ele passa por muitos desafios, mas nunca desiste. A força em perseverar, mesmo quando confrontado com adversidades, é uma lição valiosa a se aplicar na vida real. 4. Adaptabilidade: Sukuna se adapta rapidamente a novas situações e adversários. Essa capacidade de se ajustar e mudar táticas quando necessário é uma habilidade importante tanto pessoal quanto profissionalmente. 5. Autoaperfeiçoamento: O desejo de Sukuna de se tornar ainda mais poderoso reflete a ideia de buscar o autoaperfeiçoamento contínuo. Na vida real, estar comprometido com o crescimento pessoal e profissional é essencial para evoluir como indivíduo. 6. Ler as intenções dos outros: Sukuna é habilidoso em ler pessoas e antecipar suas ações. Ser capaz de compreender as motivações dos outros pode ajudar na comunicação, negociação e em relacionamentos interpessoais. Apesar dessas características positivas, é importante frisar que muitos aspectos da personalidade e das ações de Sukuna são extremamente negativos e não devem ser emulados. Ele é um personagem egoísta, cruel e sem compaixão, que causa dano para alcançar seus objetivos. Portanto, qualquer inspiração tirada dele deve ser cuidadosamente considerada e adaptada para um contexto ético e construtivo."},{"instruction":"ليست المحكمة عبر الإنترنت، على نحو عرضي، (كما اقترحت

The \`EncoderDecoderModel\` expects the \`decoder_start_token_id\` to be set in the model's configuration, as it is required for sequence generation tasks. The \`decoder_start_token_id\` is a special token used to start the decoding process when generating sequences in a sequence-to-sequence model. The error message tells you that this token id is not set, which is necessary for the model to work properly. To fix this, you should set the \`decoder_start_token_id\` attribute in the configuration of the model. For example, if you are using BERT for both the encoder and decoder in a sequence-to-sequence fashion, keep in mind that BERT is not specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like T5 or BART. However, if you still want to use this architecture for such a task, you need to configure it to assign a token as the starting token for the decoder. Here is how you can set the \`decoder_start_token_id\` in your configuration: \`\`\`python # Assuming \`model\` is already defined as an instance of EncoderDecoderModel # You need to define a suitable \`decoder_start_token_id\` # For BERT-based models, the \`cls_token_id\` is often a good choice cls_token_id = tokenizer.cls_token_id # or use an id corresponding to a token you want to be the start token # Set the decoder_start_token_id in the configuration of the model model.config.decoder_start_token_id = cls_token_id # Now you can proceed with training trainer.train() \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`tokenizer\` with the actual tokenizer instance you are using and \`model\` with your model instance. If you are generating textual content like questions, you can also choose to use the token ID that corresponds to the period \`.\` or any other token that typically signifies the start of a sentence. Additionally, since you're using an \`EncoderDecoderModel\` with BERT as both the encoder and decoder, but it's not typically used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, you may want to use a model that is better suited for such tasks like T5 or BART. These models come with predefined configurations, including \`decoder_start_token_id\`. Lastly, if you are unsure about the token ID to use, consider using a model like \`T5\` or \`BART\` that is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks and therefore has this attribute already set up in their configurations."},{"instruction":"can give me code to use arabert transformer?","output":"Certainly! If you're interested in using \`aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert\` for a task like sequence classification, here's an example of how you might use it with Hugging Face's Transformers library: First, ensure you have the Transformers library installed: \`\`\`bash pip install transformers \`\`\` Here's a simple code snippet for using \`aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert\` for sequence classification: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification import torch # Load the tokenizer and model from the Hugging Face Transformers library tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert') model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert', num_labels=2) # specify the number of labels for your classification task # Example sequence sequence = \\"هذا مثال باللغة العربية\\" # This is an example in Arabic # Tokenize the sequence tokens = tokenizer(sequence, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\") # Forward pass, get the logits logits = model(**tokens).logits # Convert logits to probabilities probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1) # Output the probabilities print(probabilities) # Optionally, convert probabilities to actual class labels _, predicted_class = torch.max(probabilities, dim=1) print(f\\"Predicted class: {predicted_class.item()}\\") \`\`\` Please replace the example text with your own data and modify \`num_labels\` to match the number of classes for your specific classification task. Keep in mind that if you're dealing with a task other than sequence classification, like token classification or question answering, you would need to use a corresponding model class (e.g., \`AutoModelForTokenClassification\` or \`AutoModelForQuestionAnswering\`). For the case of a sequence-to-sequence task, like text summarization, you would typically use a model that's been specifically designed for that purpose, such as T5 or BART, because BERT-based models like \`aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert\` are typically pre-trained for tasks like masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, and they don't have mechanisms like encoder-decoder architecture for generating text sequences.
