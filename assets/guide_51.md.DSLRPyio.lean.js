This line r splits the arrangement into symmetrical halves. 3. **Analyze Regions**:    - If the area on one side of the line r (gray region) is considered, then the opposite side will have an equivalent white region.    - By symmetry, the areas on either side of r are mirror images regarding color distribution (gray vs. white). 4. **Equivalence of Areas**:    For every gray region on one side of the line r, there is an equivalent white region opposite it and vice versa. This symmetry indicates that the gray and white regions are perfectly balanced, meaning the gray areas cover half of the total area of the larger circle. 5. **Calculate the Required Area**:    Since the gray areas mirror the white areas in a 1:1 ratio, half of the total area of the larger circle must be gray. 6. **Conclude**:    - The gray region is therefore half the area of the larger circle.    - We can confirm this by integrating the concept that symmetric object divisions into two mirror-like halves naturally result in areas being equally split. 7. **Final Answer**:    The area of the gray region is calculated accurately as follows:    [    text{Area of gray region} = frac{1}{2} times text{Area of the larger circle}    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{c} text{ metade da área do círculo maior}} ]"},{"instruction":"Four statements are given below: 1.

Given ratio: (n-2) cdot 180° : 360° = 13 : 2 Solving for n: begin{align*} frac{(n-2) cdot 180°}{360°} &= frac{13}{2}  frac{n-2}{2} &= frac{13}{2}  n-2 &= 13  n &= 15 end{align*} Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is boxed{15}. # 2. Finding the Number of Diagonals of the Polygon The formula to find the number of diagonals, D, in a polygon with n sides is given by D = frac{n(n-3)}{2}. Substituting n = 15: begin{align*} D &= frac{15(15-3)}{2}  &= frac{15 times 12}{2}  &= frac{180}{2}  &= 90 end{align*} Therefore, the number of diagonals of this polygon is boxed{90}."},{"instruction":"Four children were walking along an alley and decided to count the number of fir trees planted along it.

Given the points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ), we can choose triangle ( triangle ABC ). 1. **Identify Midpoints**:    - Let ( M_{AB}, M_{AC}, M_{AD} ) be the midpoints of segments ( AB, AC, ) and ( AD ), respectively.    - Let ( M_{BA}, M_{BC}, M_{BD} ) be the midpoints of segments ( BA, BC, ) and ( BD ), respectively.    - Let ( M_{CA}, M_{CB}, M_{CD} ) be the midpoints of segments ( CA, CB, ) and ( CD ), respectively.    - Let ( M_{DA}, M_{DB}, M_{DC} ) be the midpoints of segments ( DA, DB, ) and ( DC ), respectively. 2. **Construct Circles**:    - Construct circle ( Gamma_A ) passing through ( M_{AB}, M_{AC}, ) and ( M_{AD} ).    - Construct circle ( Gamma_B ) passing through ( M_{BA}, M_{BC}, ) and ( M_{BD} ).    - Construct circle ( Gamma_C ) passing through ( M_{CA}, M_{CB}, ) and ( M_{CD} ).    - Construct circle ( Gamma_D ) passing through ( M_{DA}, M_{DB}, ) and ( M_{DC} ). 3. **Apply the General Fact**:    - Notice that the arcs of ( Gamma_A, Gamma_B, ) and ( Gamma_C ) outside the triangle ( triangle ABC ) together measure ( 2pi ).

Thus, the eccentricity e is e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. boxed{e = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} (II) Since the polar equation of line l is given by rho(costheta + 2sintheta) + 6 = 0, converting it to Cartesian coordinates gives: x + 2y + 6 = 0 **Method 1:** The parametric equations of curve C are given by begin{cases} x = 2cosphi  y = sinphi end{cases}, where phi is the parameter. Hence, we can set coordinates of point P as (2cosphi, sinphi). The distance d from point P to line l is: d = frac{|2cosphi + 2sinphi + 6|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} Which simplifies to: d = frac{|2sqrt{2}sin(phi + frac{pi}{4}) + 6|}{sqrt{5}} The maximum value occurs when sin(phi + frac{pi}{4}) = 1, which is when phi = frac{pi}{4}. Therefore, the coordinates of P are (sqrt{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and the maximum distance d_{text{max}} is: d_{text{max}} = frac{2sqrt{2} + 6}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{10} + 6sqrt{5}}{5} boxed{d_{text{max}} = frac{2sqrt{10} + 6sqrt{5}}{5}} **Method 2:** Let the line parallel to l that is tangent to curve C be of the form x + 2y + lambda = 0. By combining the equations: begin{cases} x + 2y + lambda = 0  frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 end{cases} and eliminating y, we get 2x^{2} + 2lambda x + lambda^{2} - 4 = 0. The discriminant Delta = 4lambda^{2} - 8(lambda^{2} - 4) = -lambda^{2} + 8. Setting Delta = 0 gives us lambda = pm 2sqrt{2}. With lambda = 2sqrt{2}, the tangent point P has coordinates (sqrt{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and the maximum distance to line l is frac{2sqrt{10} + 6sqrt{5}}{5}.

Obviously, rolling a sixsided die can only produce one of six numbers (on the top face). We now ask you to design a decimal die that, when rolled, can produce one of the numbers 0 to 9 with equal probability. Is it possible for you to design such a die? If so, please provide your design plan; if not, explain why.","output":"1. **Understand the problem**:     - We need to design a “decimal die” that produces a number between 0 and 9 with equal probability when rolled. Each of the 10 numbers should have the same chance of appearing, i.e., probability frac{1}{10}.    2. **Standard Dice Shapes**:     - Common dice shapes include the six-sided die (cube) which produces numbers from 1 to 6, where each number has equal probability frac{1}{6}. 3. **Challenge**:    - The key challenge is to extend this concept to produce a range from 0 to 9. 4. **Finding the Shape**:    - Regular polyhedra such as cubes, tetrahedrons, etc., can generate outcomes with uniform probabilities. A six-sided cube could not directly model a ten-sided die. 5. **Solution - Using Polyhedra**:    - Among the various regular polyhedra, the icosahedron (20-sided die) could be useful.      6. **Design Concept**:    - To ensure each number 0 sim 9 has equal probability, use an icosahedron and label the numbers as follows:      - Each number (0 to 9) should appear on two faces of the icosahedron.      - This is feasible because 20 faces divided by 10 distinct numbers means each number repeats exactly twice. 7. **Verification**:    - Each number appears twice out of 20 faces, leading to each number having a probability:       frac{text{Number of faces per number}}{text{Total number of faces}} = frac{2}{20} = frac{1}{10}  8. **Conclusion**:    - This design ensures that each number from 0 to 9 appears with equal probability. So, we can design a \\"decimal die\\" using an icosahedron by labeling its faces with numbers 0 to 9 (each appearing twice). This satisfies the requirement of equal probability for each number.

The problem states that if you start reading these digits from a certain place in a clockwise direction, the resulting number is divisible by 27. We need to prove that starting from any other position and reading clockwise will also yield a number that is divisible by 27. 1. **Generalization**:    We will generalize the problem by replacing 1953 with any natural number ( n ), provided ( n ) is divisible by 3. Let’s denote the number formed by the digits as ( a_{0} + a_{1} cdot 10 + a_{2} cdot 10^{2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-1} ). Given that this number is divisible by 27:    [    a_{0} + a_{1} cdot 10 + a_{2} cdot 10^{2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-1} equiv 0 pmod{27}    ] 2. **Relabeling Digits**:    Consider shifting the starting digit from ( a_0 ) to ( a_1 ), making ( a_{1} ) the new starting digit. The new number now is:    [    a_{1} + a_{2} cdot 10 + a_{3} cdot 10^{2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-2} + a_{0} cdot 10^{n-1}    ] 3. **Proving divisibility by 27**:        We need to show that the new number is also divisible by 27:    [    a_{1} + a_{2} cdot 10 + a_{3} cdot 10^{2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-2} + a_{0} cdot 10^{n-1} equiv 0 pmod{27}    ] 4. **Difference between the two forms**:    To assert the divisibility, consider the difference between the original and the new number:    [    d = left(a_{0} + a_{1} cdot 10 + a_{2} cdot 10^{2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-1}right) - left(a_{1} + a_{2} cdot 10 + a_{3} cdot 10^{2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-2} + a_{0} cdot 10^{n-1}right)    ]    Simplifying the difference:    [    d = a_{0} - a_{1} + 10 a_{1} - 10 a_{2} + 10^2 a_{2} - cdots - 10^{n-2} a_{n-1} + 10^{n-1} a_{n-1} - 10^{n-1} a_{0}    ]    [    d = a_0 (1 - 10^{n-1}) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i (10^i - 10^{i-1})    ]    Note that:    [    d = a_0 (1 - 10^{n-1}) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i cdot 9    ] 5. **Checking divisibility of the simplified form**:    Since    [    a_0 (1 - 10^{n-1}) + 9 cdot (a_1 + cdots + a_{n-1})    ]    must be divisible by 27, it’s crucial to verify that:    [    10^n equiv 1 pmod{27} text{ whenever } n mod 3 = 0    ] 6. **Conclusion**:    Since ( n ) being a multiple of 3 ensures ( 10^n equiv 1 pmod{27} ), the above calculations confirm that the new number formed by shifting the starting digit is also divisible by 27 because the remainder remains zero. Therefore, starting from any other place and reading clockwise still results in a number divisible by 27.

The player who first creates a redcolored cycle loses the game. Which player has a winning strategy if ( A ) starts the game?","output":"We begin by analyzing the problem in detail and referring to the known properties of graphs. 1. **Understanding the Game:**    - In each step of the game, players A and B alternately color an edge of an n-vertex complete graph red.    - The player who first forms a red-colored cycle (a red cycle) loses the game. 2. **Conditions Depending on n:**    - The problem is meaningful for n geq 3 since for n=1 or n=2, there are no cycles to form, resulting in a \\"draw\\" because neither player can lose. 3. **Strategy for Larger n:**    Let's consider n geq 3. We claim:    - The player who colors the n-th edge will inevitably create a cycle.    - For even n, player A colors the n-th edge and hence loses.    - For odd n, player B colors the n-th edge and hence loses. 4. **Graph Theoretical Insight:**    - Known results in graph theory inform us that an n-vertex graph with n edges must contain a cycle. Therefore, after coloring the n-th edge, a red cycle exists. 5. **Analysis of Intermediate Moves:**    To demonstrate our claim, consider a state with k < n edges already colored. Let’s analyze:    - Define G_{k-1} as the graph formed by the k-1 red edges.    - Since k < n and G_{k-1} has k-1 < n-1 edges, it cannot be a connected graph, based on the known graph theory results:      - **Theorem 1:** An n-vertex connected graph has at least n-1 edges. 6. **Avoiding Cycles:**    - With G_{k-1} not being connected, it splits into two or more connected components, say H_1, H_2, ldots, H_e.    - To avoid forming a cycle when adding a new red edge in the k-th move, a player can connect a vertex from one component, say H_1, to a vertex from another component, say H_2. 7. **Cycle Formation on the n-th Edge:**    - By ensuring H_1 and H_2 are connected in this way, no cycle can form with the current k-th edge, as there would need to be another edge already existing between H_1 and H_2 to complete a cycle, which there isn't.    - Hence, until the (n-1)-th edge, a player can always avoid forming a cycle.    - Consequently, the player coloring the n-th edge will inevitably form a cycle. 8. **Conclusion:**    - If n is even, player A colors the n-th edge and loses.    - If n is odd, player B colors the n-th edge and loses.

Prove that it is not a perfect square.","output":"The problem states that in a 100-digit number, all the digits are fives except for one digit, which is different. We need to prove that such a number cannot be a perfect square. 1. **Identify the Position of the Different Digit:**    By examining where the non-five digit is placed, we consider two scenarios:    - The different digit could be at the last position (units place).    - The different digit could be at the penultimate position (tens place). 2. **Analyze Case when the Different Digit is at the Last Position:**    - If the digit deviating from 5 is in the last position, the possible values for this digit are determined by which digits can be at the end of a perfect square (i.e., 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9). However, since it isn’t 5, we focus on 1, 4, 6, or 9.    - Given the constraints, other digits are all fives. Thus, the number looks like (555 cdots 5X), where (X) is either 1, 4, 6, or 9.    - These cases do not impact the overall sum of individual digits being affected. For perfect squares, the detailed calculations show mismatched parity between sums of squares of digits and perfect square resulting numbers. 3. **Analyze Case when the Different Digit is at Penultimate Position:**    - If the digit that isn’t a five occupies the penultimate place, it must be 2 to fit the problem attributes. This gives us a number form of (555 cdots 5X5), where (X) is 2.    - To confirm such compositions aren't perfect squares, we express (555 cdots 52) where (X = 2) in squared notation as follows:            text{Assume} quad n = 10k + 5 implies (10k + 5)^2 = 100k^2 + 100k + 25.            Clearly, internal digits confirmation here exhibits even digit specifics but constructing a 100 digit number from above, approximation conflict visibly rules them out as complete squares. 4. **Conclusion for All Possible Cases:**    - We deduced that for numbers structured as (555 cdots 5X cdots):      - If X is at the units place, concluding structural patterns identify non-square behavior.      - If X is at the tens place identified logical-structural conflicts in perfect squared verification: trailing overall (55) gives line conflict assurance.

Substitute these into the equation: [ 5x^{1/2} - 3x^{1/4} = 10 + 2x^{1/4}. ] Rearrange the terms to isolate x^{1/4} on one side: [ 5x^{1/2} - 5x^{1/4} = 10. ] This equation cannot be directly simplified due to differing exponents. Let u = x^{1/4}; then x^{1/2} = (x^{1/4})^2 = u^2. The equation becomes: [ 5u^2 - 5u = 10. ] Simplify and solve for u: [ u^2 - u - 2 = 0. ] Factoring, we find: [ (u - 2)(u + 1) = 0. ] Thus, u - 2 = 0 or u + 1 = 0, giving u = 2 or u = -1. Since u = x^{1/4} and x must be non-negative (as it is a radicand), we only consider u = 2.

Since the bag of rice weighs sqrt(50) pounds and it was divided equally into 7 containers, we divide sqrt(50) by 7: Weight of rice in each container (in pounds) = sqrt(50) / 7 Now, to convert the weight from pounds to ounces, we multiply by 16 (since 1 pound = 16 ounces): Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) = (sqrt(50) / 7) * 16 Let's calculate the value: Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) = (sqrt(50) / 7) * 16 Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) = (5√2 / 7) * 16 Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) = (5 * 16√2) / 7 Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) = 80√2 / 7 Now, we can calculate the numerical value: Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) ≈ (80 * 1.414) / 7 Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) ≈ 113.12 / 7 Weight of rice in each container (in ounces) ≈ 16.16 Therefore, each container has approximately boxed{16.16}  ounces of rice."},{"instruction":"w many rearrangements of the string abcde are there in which no two adjacent letters are also adjacent letters in the alphabet, e.g., no ab, ba, bc, cd, de, etc.? **A)** 2   **B)** 4   **C)** 6   **D)** 8   **E)** 10","output":"To solve this problem, consider every permissible arrangement of the string abcde adhering to the rule that no two adjacent letters can be adjacent in the alphabet. 1. **Starting with a:**    - Next letters can't be b.

Suppose ( triangle A'B'C' ) is the inscribed triangle with semiperimeter ( p' ). 2. **Using the Relationship of Semiperimeters:**    We know from prior results (mentioned as \\"previous exercise\\") that the semiperimeter ( p' ) of the triangle ( triangle A'B'C' ) inscribed in ( triangle ABC ) satisfies the following inequality:    [     frac{r}{R} leq frac{p'}{p} leq 1     ] 3. **Using the Properties of Inradius and Circumradius:**    The inradius ( r ) and circumradius ( R ) are defined for the larger triangle ( triangle ABC ).

We can represent them as: n, n+2, n+4, n+6 where n is an even natural number. Since n is even, we can also represent it as 2k, where k is a natural number. So the four numbers can be represented as: 2k, 2k+2, 2k+4, 2k+6 Now, let's factor out the 2 from each term, as they are all even: 2(k), 2(k+1), 2(k+2), 2(k+3) We can see that the product of these four numbers will always have a factor of 2^4 (since there's a factor of 2 in each of the four numbers). So, the product is divisible by 16. However, we need to determine the largest natural number by which the product is always divisible. To do this, we need to consider the other factors in the sequence. Since we have four consecutive numbers, at least one of them must be divisible by 4 (because in a sequence of four consecutive numbers, there will always be an even number that is also a multiple of 4). Therefore, we have an additional factor of 2, which means the product is divisible by 2^5 or 32. Additionally, in any set of four consecutive numbers, there will be at least one number that is divisible by 3. This is because the remainders when dividing by 3 are 0, 1, or 2, and in a sequence of four numbers, one of them must be a multiple of 3. So, we have at least one factor of 3 in the product. Now, let's consider the largest possible factor. We have a factor of 2^5 from the even numbers and a factor of 3 from the sequence. Multiplying these together, we get: 2^5 * 3 = 32 * 3 = 96 Therefore, the largest natural number by which the product of 4 consecutive even natural numbers is always divisible is boxed{96} ."},{"instruction":"A sum fetched a total simple interest of 4052.25 at the rate of 9% p.a. in 5 years.

Let's denote the three spheres involved as follows:     - Sphere (alpha)      - Sphere (beta)     - Sphere (omega) 2. The spheres (alpha) and (beta) are tangent to sphere (omega) at points (A) and (B), respectively. 3. We select a point (M) on sphere (alpha), and the line (MA) intersects sphere (omega) again at point (N). 4. Now, the line (NB) intersects sphere (beta) again at point (K). 5. We need to find the locus of point (M) such that the line (MK) is tangent to sphere (beta). 6. We start by proving that when (MK) is tangent to sphere (beta), it is also tangent to sphere (alpha). 7. Consider the plane that passes through points (M, K, A, B), and (N). In this plane, the intersections of the spheres (alpha), (beta), and (omega) with this plane are circles. 8. Let's denote these intersections as follows:     - The intersection of sphere (alpha) with the plane is circle (alpha').     - The intersection of sphere (beta) with the plane is circle (beta').     - The intersection of sphere (omega) with the plane at points (A) and (B) forms two arcs. 9. Consider the angle (angle MKB); this angle is measured by the arc inside the angle. By properties of angles and arcs, particularly the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we have:    [    angle MKB = frac{1}{2} text{Arc} overline{KB}    ] 10. Similarly, the angle (angle BAN) is also measured by the arc inside this angle, which means:     [     angle BAN = frac{1}{2} text{Arc} overline{BN}     ] 11. Since (text{Arc} overline{KB}) and (text{Arc} overline{BN}) are equal (being related through the common tangent points (K) and (N)), it follows that:     [     angle MKB = angle BAN     ] 12. Now, consider the scenario when the line (MK) is tangent to the circle (beta'); this implies that the measure of (angle AMK) must also be related by tangential properties:     [     angle AMK = angle ABN     ]     or     [     angle AMK = 180^circ - angle ABN     ] 13. This relationship implies that point (M) lies on a circle on the sphere (alpha), which ensures that the line (MK) acts as a tangent line to both circles obtained from sphere (alpha) and sphere (beta). 14.

There are eight choices. - The remaining seven cards must be in ascending order. There is exactly one way to order any set of seven specific numbers in ascending order. Thus, there are 8 cdot 1 = 8 ways to arrange the cards such that removing one results in an ascending sequence. However, we overcount cases where removing any two different cards from the arrangement could still leave a sequence in ascending order. These overcounts involve sequences where the two removable cards are adjacent numbers, and not at the extremes (1 or 8), as their removal would not allow both removals leading to a perfect ascending order.  For example, removing the 2nd and 3rd smallest or 3rd and 4th smallest, etc., must be counted: - The specific overcount occurs for 2345678, 1345678, 1245678, 1235678, 1234678, 1234578. - Each has 2 specific removals that maintain order, thus we subtract these overcounted arrangements: 6 times 2 = 12. However, we need to add back the cases where exactly one of these sequences can be formed by removing one specific card: - These are sequences like 12345678, which we initially counted once but subtracted twice. So, the correct count for ascending order is 8 - 12 + 1 = -3 + 1 = -2. There seems to be a mistake since we cannot have a negative count. Revisiting the calculations, we realize that for eight cards, the only general removed card yielding an ordered sequence of seven must be an extreme (either smallest or largest), thus only 2 ways (remove 1 or remove 8), without overcounts.

Simplify sqrt{frac{1}{12}}times sqrt{27}. We know that sqrt{frac{1}{12}} = sqrt{frac{1}{4}timesfrac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{2}sqrt{frac{1}{3}} and sqrt{27} = sqrt{9times3} = 3sqrt{3}.

The angle bisector of the right angle is equal to the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse. 2. The angle bisector of the right angle is equal to one of the other triangle's altitudes (which means it is equal to the other leg of the triangle). Let's study these cases in detail:  Case 1: 1. Here, the angle bisector of the right angle is equal to the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse. Since the altitude in a right triangle from the right angle to the hypotenuse is also the height of the right triangle, it must bisect both the right angle and the hypotenuse. 2. To construct such a triangle, we first draw the hypotenuse (AB) and then find its midpoint (M). 3. Through (M), we draw a perpendicular to (AB) (this will be the altitude from point (C), the right angle vertex).  4. From point (M), we measure a length equal to half of the hypotenuse, which will be the length of the legs of our isosceles right-angled triangle since the altitude and angle bisector coincide. 5. The intersection of this perpendicular line with the circle drawn with radius (AB/2) and center at (M) gives point (C).  So, the points (A), (B), and (C) form the required right-angled triangle.  Case 2: 1. In this case, the angle bisector of the right angle is equal to one of the other triangle's altitudes. This implies that one of the legs of the triangle (say AB) will also serve as the height of the triangle. 2. This will create an isosceles right-angled triangle, where the altitude from point (C) (the right angle vertex) will be perpendicular to (AB), and bisect it into two equal segments. 3. The angles formed by these bisectors and heights in this triangle will thus be (45^circ) between the two legs (each of the legs being equal and perpendicular to each other), and the base angles thus will be (67.5^circ) each. 4. We then recognize the (22.5^circ) segment towards each side of the hypotenuse making it exactly half of the involved right angle.     Therefore, to construct this triangle: 1. Draw the hypotenuse (AB). 2. Construct a perpendicular at point (A) to (AB). 3. Divide the angle at point (A) into half to get (22.5^circ). 4.

Define alpha = cos frac{2npi}{m} + i sin frac{2npi}{m} and beta = cos frac{2npi}{m} - i sin frac{2npi}{m}. Then we have:        alpha + beta = 2cos frac{2npi}{m}, quad alpha beta = 1, quad alpha^m = beta^m = 1.     2. Rewrite the given functional equation using alpha and beta:        f(x + lambda) + alpha beta f(x - lambda) = (alpha + beta) f(x).     3. Rearrange and split into two parts:        begin{aligned}    f(x + lambda) - alpha f(x) &= beta [ f(x) - alpha f(x - lambda) ],     f(x + lambda) - beta f(x) &= alpha [ f(x) - beta f(x - lambda) ].    end{aligned}     4.

Given alpha^m = beta^m = 1:        f[x + (m + 1)lambda] - alpha f(x + m lambda) = f(x + lambda) - alpha f(x).     6. Similarly, using the second rearrangement:        f[x + (m+1)lambda] - beta f(x + m lambda) = f(x + lambda) - beta f(x).     7.

A number ( n in V ) is called indecomposable in ( V ) if it is impossible to find ( k, l in V ) such that ( n = k cdot l ). Prove that there exists a number ( N in V ) that can be factorized into indecomposable factors in ( V ) in more than one way.","output":"Given a prime number ( p ) greater than 5, let ( V ) be the collection of all positive integers ( n ) that can be written in the form ( n = k p + 1 ) or ( n = k p - 1 ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots ). We are asked to prove that there exists a number ( N in V ) which can be factorized into indecomposable factors in ( V ) in more than one way.  Step 1: General Lemma Application Consider the set ( V ) as defined and suppose we generalize this for ( G ) being a proper subgroup of ( mathbb{Z}^*_{n} ) (the multiplicative group of residue classes modulo ( n ) that are coprime to ( n )). Let ( V ) be the union of elements of ( G ). An element ( m in V ) is called indecomposable in ( V ) if there do not exist ( p, q in V ) (not equal to (pm 1)) such that ( pq = m ). We aim to show there exists some ( r in V ) which can be expressed as a product of indecomposable elements in ( V ) in more than one way.  Step 2: Lemma on Primes Excluded from ( V ) **Lemma:** There are infinitely many primes not in ( V ) that do not divide ( n ). **Proof of Lemma:** 1. Assume there exist only a finite number of primes not in ( V ). Let these primes be ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ). 2. Consider the number ( M = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k + n ). 3. Since ( M notin V ) (because ( V ) is closed under multiplication), ( M ) must be coprime to ( n ) and each ( p_i ). 4. This implies that ( M ) has a prime factor not in ( { p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k } ), which contradicts our assumption of the finiteness of such primes. Thus, there are infinitely many primes not in ( V ) that do not divide ( n ).  Step 3: Construction of Desired Number in ( V ) **Construction:** 1. Take two such primes ( p ) and ( q ) which are congruent modulo ( n ). 2. Let ( p^k ) be the least power of ( p ) such that ( p^k in V ). Similarly, consider ( q^k ). 3. Note that ( p^k, q^k, p^{k-1}q, p q^{k-1} in V ) and let these be indecomposable in ( V ).  Step 4: Demonstrating Multiple Factorizations We have: [ r = p^k cdot q^k = (p^{k-1} q) cdot (p q^{k-1}) ] This demonstrates that ( r ) has the desired property: it can be factorized in ( V ) in at least two distinct ways using indecomposable elements: [ r = p^k cdot q^k ] and [ r = (p^{k-1} q) cdot (p q^{k-1}). ] This completes the proof that there exists a number ( N in V ) that can be decomposed into indecomposable factors in more than one way.

Let ( K ) be a common multiple of all the differences ( a_i - a_j ) for ( 1 leq i < j leq n ). Such a ( K ) exists because it can be the least common multiple (LCM) of these differences. For example, if ( m ) is the maximum of ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ), then ( K = m! ) (factorial of ( m )) is one such common multiple. Now, define a new set of integers ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n, b_{n+1} ) where: [ b_i = a_i + K quad text{for} quad 1 leq i leq n ] [ b_{n+1} = K ] We need to show that the new set satisfies the property, i.e., for any ( 1 leq i < j leq n+1 ), [ b_i - b_j mid b_i + b_j. ] Consider the following cases: 1. **Case 1:** When ( 1 leq i < j leq n ):    [    b_i - b_j = (a_i + K) - (a_j + K) = a_i - a_j    ]    [    b_i + b_j = (a_i + K) + (a_j + K) = a_i + a_j + 2K    ]    From the induction hypothesis, we know that ( a_i - a_j mid a_i + a_j ). Since ( a_i - a_j mid 2K ) (since ( K ) is a multiple of each ( a_i - a_j )),    [    a_i - a_j mid (a_i + a_j + 2K).    ] 2. **Case 2:** When ( j = n+1 ) and ( 1 leq i leq n ):    [    b_i - b_{n+1} = (a_i + K) - K = a_i    ]    [    b_i + b_{n+1} = (a_i + K) + K = a_i + 2K    ]    Clearly,    [    a_i mid (a_i + 2K).    ] Hence, in both cases, the conditions are satisfied, proving that we can construct such a set for ( n+1 ) given the set for ( n ). By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all ( n geq 2 ).  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"There are 35 bottle caps in Beverly's bottle cap collection.

The task is to determine whether it is always possible to form a crew of 4 people in which everyone is friends with each other.  1. Consider an arbitrary astronaut ( K ). 2. Let ( G ) represent the group of ( K )'s 14 friends. Since the total cohort consists of 20 people, the complementary group ( G^* ) (the rest of the astronauts including ( K )) will consist of 6 people. 3. Inside the group ( G ), for any astronaut ( C ), they must have at least 8 friends specifically within ( G ) (because they already have 14 friends in total, out of which 6 are potentially outside group ( G ) or in ( G^* )).     This comes from subtracting the number of people possibly in ( G^* ):     [     14 - 6 = 8     ] 4. Now, let's analyze the situation within group ( G ). Consider any two friends in ( G ), say ( A ) and ( B ).     - Suppose ( A ) and ( B ) do not share any common friends in ( G ). This implies each of them has 7 friends within ( G ) not including each other:     [     7 (A's friends) + 7 (B's friends) + 2 (A and B themselves) = 16     ] 5. However, ( G ) only contains 14 people which contradicts the calculation above indicating there might be a non-overlapping pair. This inconsistency shows that:     - There must exist at least one common friend between any two friends ((A, B)) in ( G ). 6. By this logic, within ( G ), we can always find at least one trio of friends ( (A, B, C) ) who mutually know each other. 7. Therefore, combining ( K ) with this trio ((A, B, C)) forms a set of 4 astronauts who all know each other. # Conclusion: Thus, it is always possible to form such a crew of 4 astronauts where everyone is friends with each other.

Using double-angle formulas, we know that:    [    tan(a) = frac{2 tan left(frac{a}{2}right)}{1 - tan^2 left(frac{a}{2}right)} = frac{2t}{1 - t^2}    ] 2. **Expressing in terms of ( t )**: To relate (cos(a)) and (sin(a)) to ( t ), remember the identity:    [    tan left(frac{a}{2}right) = frac{1 - cos(a)}{sin(a)} quad text{or} quad frac{sin(a)}{1 + cos(a)}    ] This can be rearranged to:    [    frac{1}{t} = frac{sin(a)}{1 - cos(a)} quad text{or} quad frac{1}{t} = frac{1 + cos(a)}{sin(a)}    ] 3. **Derive (sin(a)) and (cos(a))**: We start with:    [    frac{1}{t} = frac{1 + cos(a)}{sin(a)}    ] Using identity ( tan(a) = frac{sin(a)}{cos(a)} ) and remembering that ( frac{1}{t} = frac{1 + cos(a)}{sin(a)} ):    [    cos(a) = frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}    ] and    [    sin(a) = frac{2t}{1 + t^2}    ] Finally, we directly have:    [    tan(a) = frac{sin(a)}{cos(a)} = frac{2t}{1 - t^2}    ] 4. **Summary Formulas**: Thus, the expressions for (sin(a)), (cos(a)), and (tan(a)) in terms of (t) are:    [    begin{aligned}    sin(a) &= frac{2t}{1 + t^2}     cos(a) &= frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}     tan(a) &= frac{2t}{1 - t^2}    end{aligned}    ] 5. **Obtaining the Parametrization**: Given the equations for (sin(a)) and (cos(a)), we obtain a rational parameterization of the circle by letting:    [    begin{aligned}    x &= cos(a) = frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}     y &= sin(a) = frac{2t}{1 + t^2}    end{aligned}    ] 6. **Geometric Interpretation**: This parameterization ( x = frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ) and ( y = frac{2t}{1+t^2} ) is known as the stereographic projection. The stereographic projection maps points on the real line (with parameter ( t )) to points on the unit circle, except the point ((1, 0)). The point ((1,0)) is mapped from (t rightarrow infty). 7. **Pythagorean Triples**: From (cos(a)) and (sin(a)), we observe that if ( t ) is a rational number, then both (cos(a)) and (sin(a)) are rational numbers. This corresponds to rational points on the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ), which are related to Pythagorean triples ((m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2)). # Conclusion: [ boxed{begin{aligned} sin(a) &= frac{2t}{1 + t^2}  cos(a) &= frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}  tan(a) &= frac{2t}{1 - t^2} end{aligned}} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose that x is inversely proportional to y.

The increase in grapes is 20% of the current usage of 90 kilograms: 20% of 90 kg = 0.20 * 90 kg = 18 kg So, after the increase, Borris will use: 90 kg + 18 kg = 108 kg Now, we know that after increasing his production, Borris will need 216 kilograms of grapes in a year. Since we know the increased monthly usage, we can find out how many months 216 kilograms will last: 216 kg / 108 kg per month = 2 months However, we are asked to find out how many months the current amount of grapes (90 kg) lasts before the increase. Since the increased production will use 108 kg per month, and the current production uses 90 kg, we can calculate the current duration as follows: 216 kg / 90 kg per month = 2.4 months Therefore, the current amount of grapes lasts for boxed{2.4}  months."},{"instruction":"Let ( C ) and ( D ) be two distinct points on a semicircle with diameter ([A B]).

Show that the midpoints of the segments ([A B]), ([C D]), and ([E F]) are collinear.","output":"1. **Interpreting the Initial Conditions:**    - We are given two points C and D on a semicircle with diameter overline{AB}.    - The lines (AC) and (BD) intersect at point E.    - The lines (AD) and (BC) intersect at point F. 2. **Identify Key Properties:**    - Since C and D are on a semicircle with diameter overline{AB}, the angles angle ACB and angle ADB are right angles, i.e., 90^{circ}.    - This property implies that C and D lie on the circle with diameter overline{AB}. 3. **Consider the Circle Property:**    - The fact that angle ACB = 90^circ and angle ADB = 90^circ indicates that (AC) and (BD) (intersecting at E), as well as (AD) and (BC) (intersecting at F), are right angles with respect to overline{AB}. 4. **Relating New Circle:**    - Given the point C and D are also on the circle with diameter overline{EF}, the angles angle FCE and angle FDE are also right angles, i.e., 90^{circ}.    - Therefore, C and D are on the circle with diameter overline{EF} as well. 5. **Center and Mediator Properties:**    - Let N be the midpoint of overline{EF}. Since N is the center of the circle with diameter overline{EF} and C and D are on this circle, the radius properties imply NC = ND. Thus, N lies on the perpendicular bisector (mediator) of overline{CD}.    - Similarly, let O be the midpoint of overline{AB}. Since O is the center of the initial circle with diameter overline{AB}, it also lies on the perpendicular bisector of overline{CD}. 6. **Conclusion of Alignment:**    - The midpoint M of overline{CD}, by definition, lies on the perpendicular bisector of overline{CD}.    - Therefore, since O, N, and M all lie on the perpendicular bisector of overline{CD}, they are collinear.  Thus, the midpoints of overline{AB}, overline{CD}, and overline{EF} are aligned, as required.

What can be said about the uniqueness of this representation?","output":"1. **Identify and Separate the Discrete Component**:    To separate the discrete component from the distribution function ( F ), we define:    [    alpha_{1} = sum_{y} [F(y) - F(y-)]    ]    and    [    F_{mathrm{d}}(x) = frac{1}{alpha_{1}} sum_{y: x geqslant y} [F(y) - F(y-)]    ]    Here, ( sum_{y} ) is defined correctly and represents the sum over all points ( y ) where ( F ) has jumps, which is a countably infinite set because ( F ) is an increasing right-continuous function. 2. **Result of Removing the Discrete Component**:    Removing the discrete component ( alpha_{1} F_{mathrm{d}} ) from ( F ) leaves us with a continuous function:    [    F - alpha_{1} F_{mathrm{d}} text{ is continuous}    ]    Here, ( F_{mathrm{d}} ) is uniquely determined by the above condition. 3. **Assume ( F ) is Continuous and Use Lebesgue Decomposition**:    Without loss of generality, assume now ( F ) is continuous. To utilize the Lebesgue decomposition theorem, consider the measure ( mu ) associated with the distribution function ( F ) on ((mathbb{R}, mathscr{B}(mathbb{R}))).

The product of roots, given by frac{c}{a} for the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, should be negative to ensure one root is positive and the other negative. Given the quadratic equation in our case is ax^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, 1. We have b = 2, a = a (given), and c = 1. 2. The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4a cdot 1 = 4 - 4a. For the discriminant to be greater than 0, we must have 4 - 4a > 0, which simplifies to 1 - a > 0 or a < 1. 3. The product of the roots is frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{a}.

Since each row can have at most 1 rook, and similarly for each column, there can be at most 4 rooks in these 4 rows and 3 rooks in these 3 columns.    * However, each of these rooks might be counted twice (once in a row and once in a column). Therefore, we need to avoid overcounting. 7. **Summarize rook placement:**    * The maximum count of independent rooks (those not attacking each other) possible in these remaining rows and columns is limited by the min{number of rows, number of columns} = min{4, 3} = 3.    * Hence, adding the rooks, the total maximum number of rooks possible outside the rectangle is 4+3-3 = 4. 8. **Contradiction:**    * We have shown that it's impossible to place more than 4 rooks outside the specified 4 times 5 rectangle, but initially, we had 8 rooks on the chessboard.    * This leads to a contradiction since 8 > 4. 9. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, our original assumption that there exists a 4 times 5 rectangle on the chessboard with no rooks is incorrect. # Conclusion:   Hence, any 4 times 5 rectangle of the chessboard must contain at least 1 rook. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Let ( P(x) ) be a nonzero polynomial of degree ( n ) with nonnegative coefficients such that the function ( y = P(x) ) is odd. Can it happen that for distinct points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) on the graph ( G: y = P(x) ) the following conditions hold: the tangent to the graph ( G ) at the point ( A_1 ) passes through the point ( A_2 ), the tangent at the point ( A_2 ) passes through the point ( A_3 ), …, the tangent at the point ( A_n ) passes through the point ( A_1 )?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to prove that given a polynomial ( P(x) ) of odd degree ( n ) with non-negative coefficients and the function ( y = P(x) ) being odd, it is impossible to have tangents at different points ( A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} ) on the graph passing through successive points.  1. Polynomial and Its Derivative Given that the polynomial ( P(x) ) is an odd function with non-negative coefficients, it must have the form: [ P(x)=a_{2m+1} x^{2m+1} + a_{2m-1} x^{2m-1} + ldots + a_1 x ] where ( a_{2m+1}, a_{2m-1}, ldots, a_1 ) are non-negative coefficients. The derivative ( P'(x) ), denoted as ( Q(x) ), is: [ Q(x) = P'(x) = a_{2m+1}(2m+1)x^{2m} + a_{2m-1}(2m-1)x^{2m-2} + ldots + a_1 ]  2. Tangent Line Equation Consider any point ( A(z, P(z)) ) on the graph of ( P(x) ). The equation of the tangent line to the graph at this point is given by: [ y = Q(z)(x - z) + P(z) ]  3. Condition for Tangent Passing Through Another Point Suppose the tangent line at point ( A(z, P(z)) ) passes through another point ( B(t, P(t)) ). Then, substituting ( t ) in the equation of the tangent line, we get: [ P(t) = Q(z)(t - z) + P(z) ] Rearranging, we obtain: [ P(t) - P(z) = (t - z)Q(z) ]  4. Polynomial Degree Analysis Divide the above equation by ( t - z ): [ frac{P(t) - P(z)}{t - z} = Q(z) ] or, equivalently, [ Q(z) = frac{P(t) - P(z)}{t - z} ]  5. Evaluation of Terms For an odd degree ( n = 2m+1 ): [ P(t)-P(z) = a_{2m+1} (t^{2m+1} - z^{2m+1}) + a_{2m-1} (t^{2m-1} - z^{2m-1}) + ldots + a_1 (t - z) ] We evaluate the signs based on whether ( t ) and ( z ) are of the same or different signs. If ( t ) and ( z ) are of the same signs (both positive or both negative), the power terms such as ( t^{2m+1} - z^{2m+1} ) have predictable behaviors based on ( |t| ) and ( |z| ).  6. Argument on Switching Signs Because ( P(x) ) is an odd function and has non-negative coefficients, the polynomial will change its nature (convexity to concavity or vice versa) across different intervals. Thus, - If ( |z| > |t| ), the expression ( (t-z)Q(z) ) is positive if ( t ) and ( z ) are of the same sign. - If ( |z| < |t| ), ( (t-z)Q(z) ) becomes negative due to the nature of odd degree terms.  7. Verifying Conditions If the tangent at ( A_i ) passes through ( A_{i+1} ), the signs must alternate due to the polynomial's behavior of being odd: - This alternation leads to the polynomial's properties where tangents do not stay consistently on the same side of the y-axis because the polynomial's terms change behavior across intervals. Finally, this alternation and behavior make it impossible for the tangent at point ( A_n ) to return and pass through the initial point ( A_1 ).

This means that events A and C are mutually exclusive because the occurrence of one event prevents the occurrence of the other. Moreover, their union covers all possible outcomes (either A wins a prize or does not win a prize), making them mutually exclusive. **Option C: P(B+C) = P(C)** - Since event B (A won the first prize) is a subset of event C (A won a prize), adding event B to event C does not change the probability of event C. This is because event C already includes the probability of winning the first prize along with the second prize. Therefore, P(B+C) = P(C). **Option D: P(BC) = P(C)** - The notation P(BC) suggests the probability of both events B and C occurring simultaneously.

By Brion's theorem, the lines connecting opposite vertices of a hexagon, when extended, will intersect at a single point. Hence, the lines (AD), (BE), and (CF) meet at a point ( L ). 3. Because the sphere ( Omega ) touches all the pyramid's faces:     - The circle ( omega ) formed by the intersection of the sphere and the plane containing the hexagon intersects each side ( AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA ) tangentially.      - We draw tangents from the points of tangency on the hexagon to the points where the sphere touches the plane. 4. Next, construct lines ( A_1D_1 ), ( B_1E_1 ), and ( C_1F_1 ) such that they are parallel to respective lines ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ), and intersect at the points of tangency on the circle ( omega ). 5. According to the geometry of the hexagon and the properties of the tangential points and their respective lines:     - Since the tangents ( A_1D_1 ), ( B_1E_1 ), and ( C_1F_1 ) are parallel to the corresponding diagonals ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ) respectively, these tangents are concurrent by the Varignon's theorem. 6. The lines ( A_1D_1 ), ( B_1E_1 ), and ( C_1F_1 ) will intersect at their common point ( L_1 ), which lies on the line of intersection of the planes containing ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ). 7. Now considering the plane containing ( l ) formed by the intersections of the tangential points at the edges of the hexagon along with intersections mentioned:     - Since the tangents ( A_1D_1 ), ( B_1E_1 ), and ( C_1F_1 ) come from the sphere touching points, they lie in the tangential plane from the sphere which is the same plane of those intersection points. 8. Through reiterating the positions of lines ( m ) and ( n ) in context:     - Since ( m ) containing ( OL ) is the conjunction of the plane along the diagonals of the hexagon and all lies in the same planar structure.     - Optionally, line ( n ) follows the same logical pathway and must necessarily prove intersecting as well with the tangential lines ( ell ) on the same conjunction. # Conclusion: Thus, utilizing the geometric places and properties of concurrent lines from Brion’s theorem, tangency nature from properties of circle in hexagon, completeness follows from: [ boxed{ell ,text{and}, n ,text{lie on the same plane}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let A and B be diagonally opposite vertices of a cube.

There are a total of 12 edges in the cube. 3. **Identify Relevant Edges**:    We focus on the 6 edges that do not contain either (A) or (B). These edges are opposite to each other in pairs. 4. **Locate Midpoints**:    Let's denote a midpoint of one of these relevant edges as (X). This point (X) is halfway along one edge, so its coordinates relative to the cube can be expressed as:    [    X = left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}, frac{z_1 + z_2}{2}right)    ]    where ((x_1, y_1, z_1)) and ((x_2, y_2, z_2)) are the coordinates of the two endpoints of the edge containing (X). 5. **Distance from Vertices to Midpoints**:    Since (A) and (B) are diagonally opposite, their coordinates can be considered as:    [    A = (0, 0, 0), quad B = (2k, 2k, 2k)    ]    The distance between (A) and (X) is:    [    AX = sqrt{left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{z_1 + z_2}{2}right)^2}    ]    Since (X) is the midpoint of an edge not containing (A) or (B), it simplifies to:    [    AX = BX = sqrt{k^2 + k^2 + (2k)^2} = sqrt{5k^2} = ksqrt{5}    ]    Hence, (X) is on the sphere centered at (A) with radius (ksqrt{5}) and similarly on the sphere centered at (B) with radius (ksqrt{5}). 6. **Intersection of Spheres**:    The intersection of the two spheres centered at (A) and (B) with radius (ksqrt{5}) is a circle. This intersection defines a plane. 7. **Planarity of Midpoints**:    Therefore, these midpoints lie on this circle, making them planar. 8. **Distance Between Adjacent Midpoints**:    Let (X) and (Y) be two adjacent midpoints of the edges.    The distance between any two adjacent midpoints (X) and (Y) can be computed as:    [    XY = sqrt{left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} - frac{x_3 + x_4}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} - frac{y_3 + y_4}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} - frac{z_3 + z_4}{2}right)^2}    ]    This simplifies to:    [    XY = sqrt{(k)^2 + (k)^2} = sqrt{2k^2} = ksqrt{2}    ] 9. **Conclusion of Hexagon Being Regular**:    Since all sides (XY) are equal and the midpoints lie on a circle, the hexagon formed by these midpoints is regular and planar.

The sum of the alternating sums of all nonempty subsets of set A is () A: ncdot 2^{n} B: ncdot 2^{n1} C: nleft(n+1right)cdot 2^{n} D: nleft(n+1right)cdot 2^{n1}","output":"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the structure of the subsets of the set A={1,2,3,cdots ,n} and how the \\"alternating sums\\" of these subsets contribute to the overall sum we're looking for.  First, let's understand that any non-empty subset of A can either contain the element n or not contain it. This fundamental division allows us to categorize all non-empty subsets into two distinct categories: 1. **Subsets containing n**: These subsets have n as their largest element, and thus n will be the starting point of their \\"alternating sum\\". 2. **Subsets not containing n**: These are all possible subsets of the set {1,2,3,cdots ,n-1}. Given the total number of non-empty subsets of A is 2^n - 1 (since each element can either be in a subset or not, giving 2^n possibilities, minus the empty set), excluding the set {n} itself gives us 2^n - 2 non-empty subsets. We can establish a bijection between subsets not containing n (second category) and subsets containing n (first category) by simply adding n to each subset of the second category. For a given subset A_i not containing n, its corresponding subset in the first category is A_i cup {n}.  If the \\"alternating sum\\" of a subset A_i is k, then for the subset A_i cup {n}, the \\"alternating sum\\" would be n - k because n would be the first and largest element of the subset in the \\"alternating sum\\" sequence, effectively subtracting k from n.

Let ( r ) be the vertex closest to ( k ) in ( U ) in that direction such that ( r ) lies in ( V ). We know that ( r ) is not directly adjacent to ( k ) in ( U ). This implies the existence of an even cycle because there are two ways of different parity in ( V ) to travel between ( k ) and ( r ), and there is a way to travel between ( k ) and ( r ) via vertices not in ( V ) (via ( U )). 7. **Constructing subsets ( A ) and ( B )**:    Let us label the walk ( w_1, w_2, cdots, w_{2t} ).

However, since you've already provided the total number of plants as 19.118487538913932, we can work backwards to find the area of the bed. First, let's round the number of plants to a whole number because you can't have a fraction of a plant. So we'll round 19.118487538913932 to 19 plants. Now, if each plant requires 4 cm², then for 19 plants, the total area required would be: Total area = Number of plants × Area per plant Total area = 19 plants × 4 cm²/plant Total area = 76 cm² This is the area of the circular bed. Now, to find the outer edge (circumference) of the circular bed, we need to know the radius. The area of a circle is given by the formula: Area = πr² Where π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the radius: r = √(Area/π) Plugging in the area we found: r = √(76 cm²/π) r = √(76/3.14159) r = √(24.18879020478639) r ≈ 4.92 cm Now that we have the radius, we can find the circumference (outer edge) of the circular bed using the formula: Circumference = 2πr Circumference = 2 × π × 4.92 cm Circumference ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 4.92 cm Circumference ≈ 30.91 cm So, the outer edge of the circular bed measures approximately boxed{30.91}  cm."},{"instruction":"Given angle 1 + angle 2 = 180^circ and angle 3 = angle 4, find angle 4 where angle 3 = frac{1}{2} angle 4.

If we set ( (p_0, q_0) = (a_0, 1) ), ( (p_1, q_1) = (a_0 a_1 + 1, a_1) ), and ( (p_n, q_n) = (a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}, a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}) ) for all ( n geq 2 ), then:    - ( c_n = frac{p_n}{q_n} ) for all ( n geq 0 ).    - ( p_n q_{n-1} - q_n p_{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1} ) (so ( c_n ) and ( c_{n-1} ) are adjacent) for all ( n > 0 ).    - ( p_n q_{n-2} - p_{n-2} q_n = (-1)^n a_n ) for all ( n > 1 ). 4. We have ( f(c_0) = a_0 ), ( f(c_1) = fleft( ((a_1-1).c_0) * (a_0+1) right) = a_0 + frac{1}{2^{a_1-1}} ). Using ( c_n = (a_n.c_{n-1})*c_{n-2} ), we can prove by induction:    [    f(c_n) = a_0 - 2 sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}}    ]    for all ( n > 0 ). 5. **Case 1:** ( x ) is rational. Then ( x = [a_0, ldots, a_m] ) for some ( m geq 0 ). If ( m = 0 ), then ( x ) is an integer and ( f(x) = x ). Otherwise:    [    f(x) = f(c_m) = a_0 - 2 sum_{k=1}^{m} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}}    ]    which is uniquely determined. 6. **Case 2:** ( x ) is irrational. Then the continued fraction is infinite. We have ( x = lim_{n to infty} c_n ). From the properties of continued fractions, we get ( (c_{2n}) ) (resp. ( (c_{2n+1}) )) is increasing (resp. decreasing), so ( c_{2n} leq x leq c_{2n+1} ) for all ( n geq 0 ). Since ( f ) is increasing, it follows that:    [    f(c_{2n}) leq f(x) leq f(c_{2n+1})    ]    for all ( n geq 0 ). 7. But ( f(c_n) = a_0 - 2 sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}} ) for all ( n geq 1 ), and ( A_k geq k ), so ( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}} ) is convergent. Therefore, ( (f(c_n)) ) converges to:    [    a_0 - 2 sum_{n geq 1} frac{(-1)^n}{2^{A_n}}    ]    We conclude that:    [    f(x) = a_0 - 2 sum_{n geq 1} frac{(-1)^n}{2^{A_n}}    ]    which is uniquely determined. The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = a_0 - 2 sum_{n geq 1} frac{(-1)^n}{2^{A_n}} } )"},{"instruction":"On the extensions of the bases (AD) and (BC) of trapezoid (ABCD) beyond points (A) and (C), points (K) and (L) are taken.

It is then cut into some smaller cubes of equal size. There is 1 smaller cube with no color. How many smaller cubes were created in total?","output":"If there is 1 smaller cube with no color, it means that this cube must have come from the very center of the larger cube. Since it's from the center, it is surrounded by other cubes on all sides, which means the larger cube must have been cut into smaller cubes at least 3 layers deep in each dimension. To visualize this, imagine a 3x3x3 cube structure. The smaller cube in the very center of this structure would be the one with no color, as it is completely enclosed by the other cubes. The cubes on the edges and corners would have some colored sides because they were on the surface of the original larger cube. So, the total number of smaller cubes would be the number of cubes in a 3x3x3 structure, which is 3^3 = boxed{27} ."},{"instruction":"A regular 12sided polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1. How many chords of the circle that join two of the vertices of the 12gon have lengths whose squares are rational?","output":"1. We begin by considering a regular 12-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius ( 1 ). This means the vertices of the polygon lie on the circle. 2. To solve for the number of chords whose lengths' squares are rational, we note that such chords subtend specific angles at the center of the circle. A chord of the circle connecting two vertices of the 12-sided polygon will subtend minor arcs of (30^circ, 60^circ, 90^circ, 120^circ, 150^circ), or (180^circ). 3. Let’s calculate the square of the chord length for each of these angles using the Law of Cosines.     For a chord that subtends an angle ( theta ) at the center, the length of the chord can be found using the Law of Cosines in the isosceles triangle formed by the two radii and the chord:    [    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(theta)    ]    Here, ( a = b = 1 ) (the radii of the circle). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:    [    c^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2 cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot cos(theta) = 2 - 2 cos(theta)    ]    We need this to be a rational number. 4.

We find that chords subtending angles of ( 60^circ, 90^circ, 120^circ), and ( 180^circ ) at the center of the circle have lengths whose squares are rational. 6. Calculate the number of such chords:    - There are 12 chords subtending each of ( 60^circ, 90^circ, ) and (120^circ) each.    - There are 6 diameters corresponding to ( 180^circ ). 7.

We can first arrange the red frogs and then find valid spots for the green and blue frogs. 1. **Arrange red frogs**: There are 4! ways to arrange the four red frogs. 2. **Choose spots for the blue frog**: After arranging the red frogs, there are 5 gaps between them (considering the ends as well), where the blue frog can be placed. This gives us 5 choices. 3. **Arrange green frogs around the blue frog**: After placing the blue frog, there are now 7 remaining spots (5 from the initial gaps minus 2 adjacent to the blue frog, plus 2 new gaps created by placing the blue frog). We need to place three green frogs in these spots, which can be done in binom{7}{3} times 3! ways. Now, compute the total number of arrangements: - Total ways = (number of ways to arrange red frogs) × (choices for the blue frog’s spot) × (ways to arrange green frogs) - Total ways = 4! times 5 times binom{7}{3} times 3!

This gives 2 valid paths.    - By symmetry, starting at A and choosing any first move gives similar results:      - (A to C) leads to (A to C to B to D) and (A to C to D to B).      - (A to D) leads to (A to D to B to C) and (A to D to C to B). 6. **Total Valid Paths**: Each initial move gives 2 valid paths, totalling (3 times 2 = 6) valid paths. 7. **Total Possible Paths**: With three moves and each potentially choosing from 2 vertices, the total possible paths = (3^3 = 27). 8. **Probability Calculation**: The probability of choosing one of the valid paths is (frac{6}{27} = frac{2}{9}). 9. **Result**: Thus, the probability that after three moves the bug will visit every vertex exactly once is (frac{2{9}}).

The standard form of the given parabola is y^2 = 4px, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. In this case, p = 1. 2. The focus F of the parabola is (p, 0), which is (1, 0). 3. Let the coordinates of point P be (x, y). According to the problem, the distance from P to F is 10. Therefore, sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = 10. 4. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 100. 5. Since P is on the parabola, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of the parabola. Therefore, we can substitute 4x for y^2 in the equation above. This gives us (x - 1)^2 + 4x = 100. 6. Expanding the square and rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in x: x^2 - 2x + 1 + 4x - 100 = 0, which simplifies to x^2 + 2x - 99 = 0. 7.

This means that b can be expressed as: b = 6m + 5 where m is some integer. Now, we are given that the remainder of a * b when divided by 48 is 15.

The term 6kmx is a multiple of 48 because it contains the factor 6, which is a divisor of 48. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to: 5kx + 18m + 15 ≡ 15 (mod 48) Now, we can subtract 15 from both sides: 5kx + 18m ≡ 0 (mod 48) Since 18m is a multiple of 6, and 48 is also a multiple of 6, the term 18m will always be a multiple of 48.

From the second shop, he spent Rs. 800, but we don't know the number of books, so the average price per book from the second shop is Rs. 800 / x. The overall average price he paid for all the books is Rs. 20 per book. To find the total number of books, we can set up the equation for the total cost divided by the total number of books: Total cost = Cost from first shop + Cost from second shop Total cost = Rs. 1000 + Rs. 800 Total cost = Rs. 1800 Total number of books = Number of books from first shop + Number of books from second shop Total number of books = 50 + x The average price per book for all the books is given as Rs. 20, so we can write the equation: Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Rs. 20 = Rs. 1800 / (50 + x) Now we can solve for x: Rs. 20 * (50 + x) = Rs. 1800 1000 + 20x = 1800 20x = 1800 - 1000 20x = 800 x = 800 / 20 x = 40 So, Rahim bought boxed{40}  books from the second shop."},{"instruction":"A certain product in a shopping mall sells an average of 30 items per day, with a profit of 50 yuan per item.

Based on this rule, please answer:<br/>(1) The daily sales volume of the mall increases by ______ items, and the profit per item is ______ yuan (expressed in algebraic expressions containing x);<br/>(2) Under the same conditions as above, in normal sales situations, how much should each item be reduced in price so that the mall's daily profit reaches 2100 yuan?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Daily Sales Volume and Profit Per Item Given that for every 1 yuan reduction in price, the mall can sell an additional 2 items per day, we can express the increase in daily sales volume and the new profit per item as functions of x, the price reduction per item. - **Increase in Daily Sales Volume**: For each yuan reduced, 2 more items are sold. Therefore, for a reduction of x yuan, the increase in sales volume is 2x items. - **Profit Per Item**: Initially, the profit per item is 50 yuan. With a reduction of x yuan in price, the new profit per item becomes 50 - x yuan. Thus, the daily sales volume increases by 2x items, and the profit per item is 50 - x yuan.  Part 2: Price Reduction for a Daily Profit of 2100 Yuan To find the required price reduction x so that the mall's daily profit reaches 2100 yuan, we set up the equation based on the given conditions:  (50 - x)(30 + 2x) = 2100  Expanding and simplifying the equation: begin{align*} 50 cdot 30 + 100x - x cdot 2x &= 2100  1500 + 100x - 2x^2 &= 2100  2x^2 - 100x + 600 &= 0  x^2 - 50x + 300 &= 0  (x - 15)(x - 20) &= 0 end{align*} Solving for x, we find two possible values: - x_1 = 15 - x_2 = 20 Given the goal is to reduce inventory quickly, we choose the larger reduction:  x = 20  Therefore, each item should be reduced by 20 yuan to achieve a daily profit of 2100 yuan.

We need to show that any initial collection of piles can be transformed into one single pile by combining piles whose sizes are similar. 2. **Consider the Reverse Process**: Instead of starting with one pile and breaking it down, visualize the reverse process. Assume we initially have several individual piles, each containing exactly one stone. The goal is to combine these individual piles into one single pile of size ( n ), where ( n ) is the total number of stones. 3. **Combining Process**: At any step, we can combine two piles of sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (where ( x leq y )) to form a new pile of size ( x + y ). This is valid under the condition that ( x ) and ( y ) are similar sizes, i.e., ( x leq y leq 2x ). 4. **Maintaining Similar Sizes**:     - Since we are starting with piles of size 1 (where all piles are similar), assume we always pick the smallest piles to combine.     - Each time we combine two piles, say sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (with ( x leq y )), the resulting pile will have size ( x + y ).      - The new pile size ( x + y ) must be less than or equal to ( 2y ), hence still meeting the requirement of similar sizes (as ( y leq 2x )). 5. **Inductive Argument**:     - We start with ( n ) piles of size 1.     - Combining pairs of piles gradually reduces the number of piles while ensuring that all resulting piles maintain the condition of similar sizes.     - The process continues, maintaining the invariant that no pile will differ from the other by more than a factor of two. 6. **Reaching the Final Pile**:     - This combining will eventually reduce the number of piles until only one pile remains.     - Since at every stage the combined pile size respects the similar size condition, the final pile formed is of size ( n ).

Now, we know that the total number of parents with full-time jobs is the total number of parents minus those without full-time jobs: Total parents with full-time jobs = P - 0.16P = 0.84P We already know that 0.30P of these are mothers with full-time jobs.

The river is 50 meters wide on average during the downstream swim and widens to 100 meters during the upstream swim. Calculate the speed of the man in still water.","output":"To calculate the speed of the man in still water, we need to determine his speed relative to the ground (or riverbank) when swimming downstream and upstream. Then we can use these speeds to find his speed in still water by accounting for the current speed. First, let's calculate the speed of the man when swimming downstream. The distance he covers is 28 km, and he swims for 2 hours. Speed = Distance / Time Downstream speed = 28 km / 2 hours = 14 km/h This downstream speed includes the speed of the current, which is 3 km/h. To find the man's speed in still water, we subtract the current speed from the downstream speed. Speed in still water (downstream) = Downstream speed - Current speed Speed in still water (downstream) = 14 km/h - 3 km/h = 11 km/h Now, let's calculate the speed of the man when swimming upstream. The distance he covers is 12 km, and he swims for 4 hours. Speed = Distance / Time Upstream speed = 12 km / 4 hours = 3 km/h This upstream speed is against the current, which is 1 km/h. To find the man's speed in still water, we add the current speed to the upstream speed. Speed in still water (upstream) = Upstream speed + Current speed Speed in still water (upstream) = 3 km/h + 1 km/h = 4 km/h We have two different values for the man's speed in still water based on downstream and upstream calculations. This discrepancy could be due to the varying width of the river affecting the man's speed or an error in the given data. However, in ideal conditions, the man's speed in still water should be the same whether he is swimming downstream or upstream. To find a more accurate speed in still water, we can average the two calculated speeds: Average speed in still water = (Speed in still water (downstream) + Speed in still water (upstream)) / 2 Average speed in still water = (11 km/h + 4 km/h) / 2 Average speed in still water = 15 km/h / 2 Average speed in still water = 7.5 km/h Therefore, the man's average speed in still water is boxed{7.5}  km/h."},{"instruction":"A complex number z satisfies z(12i)=3+2i.

We start by rewriting the equation:    [    frac{2x}{x+1}-2=frac{3}{x^2-1}    ]    Notice that x^2-1 = (x+1)(x-1), so we can rewrite the left side under a common denominator:    [    frac{2x}{x+1}-frac{2(x+1)}{x+1}=frac{3}{(x+1)(x-1)}    ]    Simplifying the left side by combining the fractions:    [    frac{2x-2(x+1)}{x+1}=frac{3}{(x+1)(x-1)}    ]    Expanding the numerator on the left:    [    frac{2x-2x-2}{x+1}=frac{3}{(x+1)(x-1)}    ]    Simplifies to:    [    frac{-2}{x+1}=frac{3}{(x+1)(x-1)}    ] 2. **Multiply both sides by the common denominator**: To eliminate the fractions, we multiply both sides by (x+1)(x-1):    [    -2(x-1)=3    ]    Expanding the left side:    [    -2x+2=3    ] 3. **Solve for x**: We now have a linear equation, which we can solve for x:    [    -2x=3-2    ]    Simplifying the right side:    [    -2x=1    ]    Dividing both sides by -2:    [    x=frac{1}{-2}    ]    Simplifying the fraction:    [    x=-0.5    ] 4. **Check the solution**: We need to ensure that our solution does not make the denominator of the original equation equal to zero. For x=-0.5, the denominator x^2-1 becomes (-0.5)^2-1=0.25-1neq 0, and the denominator x+1 becomes -0.5+1=0.5neq 0. Therefore, x=-0.5 is a valid solution to the original equation.

Given the pairwise distinct positive integers a, b, c where operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1. We need to show that there does not exist a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths a, b, c.     2. **Step 1: Proving Pairwise Coprimality**:        Since operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1, suppose a and b share a common prime factor p. This implies p divides a, p divides b, and since b mid (c-a)^2, p also divides (c-a)^2. Hence, p must divide (c-a), and consequently p must divide c too. Thus, p would be a common divisor of a, b, and c, contradicting the given (operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1).

This is because having more than two fleas jumping vertically in any column would eventually lead to two fleas occupying the same cell.     - Similarly, for fleas jumping horizontally:       - Here too, no more than two fleas can jump in the same row. Hence a maximum of two fleas per row ensures no collision. 2. **Total Count on the Board:**     - Since the board is 10 × 10, there are 10 rows and 10 columns.     - Therefore, the maximum number of fleas that can jump vertically is 2 fleas per column, leading to 2 times 10 = 20 fleas.     - The same logic applies for horizontally jumping fleas, giving another 2 times 10 = 20 fleas.     Adding both vertical and horizontal fleas, we find there can be at most 20 + 20 = 40 fleas on the board without collision. 3. **Verification Example:**      - Let's show a configuration with this maximum number:       - Place one flea in each column jumping vertically from top to bottom in a pattern such that no two fleas land on the same cell.       - For instance, label vertical jumping fleas (V) as follows:         [         begin{array}{cccccccccc}         V &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &              & V &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &              &   & V &   &   &   &   &   &   &              &   &   & V &   &   &   &   &   &              &   &   &   & V &   &   &   &   &              &   &   &   &   & V &   &   &   &              &   &   &   &   &   & V &   &   &              &   &   &   &   &   &   & V &   &              &   &   &   &   &   &   &   & V &              &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   & V          end{array}         ]       - Similarly, place one flea in each row jumping horizontally, ensuring the pattern does not overlap vertical jumpers:         [         begin{array}{cccccccccc}         H & & & & & & & & &          & H & & & & & & & &          & & H & & & & & & &          & & & H & & & & & &          & & & & H & & & & &          & & & & & H & & & &          & & & & & & H & & &          & & & & & & & H & &          & & & & & & & & H &          & & & & & & & & & H          end{array}         ]     - This example confirms that we can indeed place 40 fleas with given constraints. # Conclusion: The largest number of fleas that can be jumping on the board without two fleas ever landing on the same cell at the same time is: [ boxed{40} ]"},{"instruction":"The sequence 1, frac {1}{2}, frac {1}{4}, ldots, frac {1}{2^n}, ldots is (　　) A.

This information gives us clues about the parallel relationships and how we can use properties of medians and bisectors. 2. **Identify Important Points**:     - Since (M) is the midpoint of (AC) (being on the median), (E) lies on the line (EM) which is parallel to (BC).     - Similarly, (D) on (DK) is parallel to (AB). 3. **Midpoint and Parallel Relationships**:     - The line (EM) passes through the midpoint of (AC) (which is (M)), and it is parallel to (BC). Therefore, it divides (BC) proportionally (application of the Midpoint Theorem).     - Since (D) is on (BM) and (DK) is parallel to (AB), the same properties apply symmetrically. 4. **Symmetrical Properties**:     - The angle between (BK) and the line extending beyond the triangle brings the symmetrical properties into play.     - ( angle EKO = angle ABK ) as both are respective sections around point (K).     - Thus, by symmetry, this angle mirrors across. 5. **Equidistance and Perpendicularity**:     - By symmetry, we can also infer:         [         OE = OK = OD         ]       where (O) is a midpoint of (DK), thus it forms an equilateral type of partitioning around these events. 6. **Application of Problem 5.17**:     - Referencing Problem 5.17, we establish that the structural relationships in the geometry (parallel and angles set up) confirm ( angle DEK = 90^circ ). **Conclusion**: We conclude that line (ED) is perpendicular to (BK).

Sally drinks 2 gallons, so the amount of punch left in the bowl is ( x - text{cousin's drink} + 4 - 2 ) or ( x - text{cousin's drink} + 2 ). Finally, Mark adds 12 gallons to completely fill the bowl, which means the total amount of punch in the bowl is now ( x - text{cousin's drink} + 2 + 12 ). Since the bowl can hold 16 gallons when full, we have: ( x - text{cousin's drink} + 2 + 12 = 16 ) Simplifying the equation: ( x - text{cousin's drink} + 14 = 16 ) ( x - text{cousin's drink} = 16 - 14 ) ( x - text{cousin's drink} = 2 ) So, the cousin drank 2 gallons of punch. Now, we know that after the cousin drank and before Mark added the 4 gallons, the bowl had ( x - 2 ) gallons of punch. After adding the 4 gallons and before Sally drank, the bowl had ( x - 2 + 4 ) gallons of punch, which simplifies to ( x + 2 ) gallons.

Solving this equation for omega gives us: [ frac{2pi}{omega} = pi implies omega = 2. ] When the graph of the function is shifted to the left by frac{pi}{3} units, the function becomes f(x)=sin [2(x+frac{pi}{3})+varphi].

This leads to the equation frac{2pi}{3} + varphi = kpi, where k is an integer. Solving for varphi gives: [ varphi = kpi - frac{2pi}{3}. ] Given the constraint |varphi| < frac{pi}{2}, when k=1, we find varphi = frac{pi}{3}.

Since the chord intercepted by the line l on circle C has a length of 2, by using the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by half of the chord, the perpendicular from the center to the chord, and the radius of the circle, we have d^2 + 1^2 = 3^2, which gives d = 2sqrt{2}.        Now, the distance from the center C(a, a + 1) to the line l: x + y - 3 = 0 is given by the formula frac{|a + (a + 1) - 3|}{sqrt{2}} = 2sqrt{2}. So, |a - 1| = 2.        Therefore, a = -1 or a = 3.

To do this, we should minimize the other temperatures while still keeping the total sum at 125 degrees. Since we have one temperature at 15 degrees, the sum of the remaining four temperatures must be 125 - 15 = 110 degrees.

Since half of the characters have the initial A, we have: Number of characters with initial A = 1/2 * 60 = 30 characters Next, let's find out how many characters have the initial C. Since half of the amount that have the initial A have the initial C, we have: Number of characters with initial C = 1/2 * 30 = 15 characters Now, we need to find out how many characters are left for the initials D and E. We subtract the number of characters with initials A and C from the total number of characters: Number of characters left for D and E = 60 - (30 + 15) = 60 - 45 = 15 characters Since the problem doesn't specify how the remaining characters are split between D and E, we can assume that they are split evenly. Therefore, the number of characters with initial D is the same as the number of characters with initial E: Number of characters with initial D = Number of characters with initial E = 15/2 = 7.5 characters However, since we can't have half a character, we need to adjust the numbers to whole characters. There are a few ways to interpret this, but one common approach would be to have an equal number of characters for D and E, which would be 7 characters each, with one character remaining. This remaining character could be assigned to either D or E, but since the problem asks for the ratio, we'll keep them equal.

Let (X, Y, Z, W) be the points where the insphere (omega) touches the faces (EAB, EBC, ECD, EDA) respectively. Let (P) be the point where the insphere touches the base (ABCD). 2. **Establish congruent triangles:**    Since the insphere is tangent to the faces of the pyramid, the tangency points create equal segments on the edges of the pyramid.

This is because, without a \\"burst\\", a frog in a cell does not move, maintaining equilibrium. In the event of a burst, the three neighboring cells receive a frog each, preserving the equilibrium if they do not further burst.     3. **Objective**:    - We need to demonstrate that after some time, every cell will have either a frog or its neighboring cells will have frogs, confirming an even distribution. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**:    - Take a cell, label it as cell ( A ), and assume initially ( A ) is empty. Denote its segment as segment 1, and another cell in the same segment as cell ( B ), as shown in figure 4.    - Label each subsequent segment in a clockwise direction from 1 to ( n ).     5. **Segmentation and Assumptions**:    - Initially, we assume segment 1 will eventually have a frog. Suppose segment 1 remains void of frogs forever:      - If no frogs ever reach segment 1, they cannot leap over the boundary between segments 1 and ( n ).

Therefore, when at least two of the dimensions are divisible by 3, we can cover the three faces sharing a common vertex without any overlap or gaps, satisfying the problem's condition. 2. **Case 2: Covering with fewer than two dimensions divisible by 3.**     Let's explore the situation when fewer than two dimensions are divisible by 3.      - scenario 1: Exactly one dimension is divisible by 3.     - scenario 2: None of the dimensions is divisible by 3.     **Scenario 1: One dimension divisible by 3.**     Suppose that only one dimension, say (a), is divisible by 3, while (b) and (c) are not.      - The total number of unit cells on the three faces meeting at a common vertex is (ab + bc + ca).     - Since both (b) and (c) are not divisible by 3, neither (bc) nor (ca) is divisible by 3. Thus, (ab) is divisible by 3 while (bc + ca) is not.     - Consequently, (ab + bc + ca) is not divisible by 3.      A perfect cover with three-cell strips implies having the total number of cells (i.e., (ab + bc + ca)) divisible by 3, which is not possible in this scenario.     **Scenario 2: No dimension divisible by 3.**     If none of the dimensions (a), (b), and (c) is divisible by 3:     - Assign numbers to the rows and columns starting from the edges and color the unit squares alternatingly.     - This results in an odd number of white squares on each face (considering that any row or column will alternate in colors and none of them happens to perfectly align into the divisibility by 3).          Trying to cover these faces with three-cell strips will always lead to a scenario where we end up needing an even number of cells to be covered to fully accomplish the task. This is a contradiction since you cannot balance covering an odd with even stripping of 3-cells equally distributed. Therefore, covering the parallelepiped with these rules cannot fully be accomplished if fewer than two dimensions are divisible by 3. # Conclusion: To achieve the complete coverage of the three selected faces with the three-cell strips such that there are no overlaps and no gaps, **at least two of the dimensions (a), (b), and (c) must be divisible by 3**.

We know the following properties hold for progressing factorials:     - If ( M_n = overline{ABCDldots} ), then typically ( M_{n+1} ) starts with (overline{ABCD+1}), since factorials grow by multiplying by an additional integer each time.    - As the number ( n ) increases, ( M_{n+1} = (m + n + 1)! ) can start with (overline{ABCD}), (overline{ABCD} + 1), or (overline{ABCD} + 2) at most. 3. **Pattern and Deductions**:    Typically for large ( m ), suppose ( a neq 9 ):     - The leading digit changes steadily as ( n ) increases, covering the numerical interval step-by-step.     - Specifically: For ( a < 9 ), among ( M_0, M_1, ldots, M_{10} ), there is at least one ( M_n ) such that the first four digits are precisely the initial four digits of ( M_0 ) incremented by 1. 4. **Ensuring Coverage**:    Utilize the above understanding to generalize:    - As you consider ( M_0, M_1, ldots, M_{10000} ), you effectively cover all progressive integers starting from any numerical point in that range up to 8999.

The cooling rate per unit volume is a crucial factor because each samovar has the same initial temperature and is cooled by the ambient environment at room temperature.    For the large samovar, each unit of surface area is responsible for losing heat corresponding to a volume ( n ) times larger compared to the small samovar. Thus, cooling efficiency per unit volume is lower for the large samovar:    [    text{Cooling rate per unit volume of large samovar} = frac{dot{Q}_L}{n^3 V_S} = frac{k A_L}{n^3 V_S} = frac{k n^2 A_S}{n^3 V_S} = frac{k A_S}{n V_S} = frac{dot{Q}_S}{n V_S}    ]        This shows that the cooling rate per unit volume for the large samovar is (frac{1}{n}) times that of the small samovar. 4. **Conclusion:**    Based on the analysis, since the large samovar has a lower cooling rate per unit volume compared to the small samovar, it implies that the small samovar will cool down to room temperature faster.

Given: ( angle text{ACD} = 120^{circ} ).     2. In an ( n )-sided regular polygon, the angle (angle text{ACD}) is subtended by the arc connecting points A to D through C. 3. Each small arc between adjacent vertices in the regular ( n )-sided polygon is (frac{1}{n} cdot 360^circ = frac{360^circ}{n}). 4. The angle (angle text{ACD}) is an inscribed angle that intercepts an arc consisting of ((n-3)) small arcs. Therefore, the measure of this arc is: [ (n-3) cdot frac{360^circ}{n} ] 5. The measure of the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc's measure. Therefore, we can write: [ angle text{ACD} = frac{1}{2} left[ (n-3) cdot frac{360^circ}{n} right] ] 6.

What is the minimum number of spheres with a radius of 1 needed to entirely cover this cylinder?","output":"1. **Cylinder Dimensions:**    Let (h) represent the height and (r) the radius of the cylinder. We are given:    [    h = 1, quad r = 1    ] 2. **Inscribing an Equilateral Triangle in the Base:**    An equilateral triangle is inscribed in the base of the cylinder. Each vertex of this triangle is at the midpoint of the generating lines of the cylinder. The side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius (r) is:    [    s = r sqrt{3}    ] 3. **Centers of the Spheres:**    Consider three unit spheres. Place the centers of these spheres at the midpoints of the sides of the inscribed equilateral triangle. The radius of each of these spheres is equal to the radius of the base of the cylinder, (r = 1). 4. **Intersection with the Plane:**    The three spheres intersect the plane of the base of the cylinder in three circles. The radii of these circles are:    [    frac{sqrt{3}}{2}    ]    These circles have their centers at the midpoints of the sides of the inscribed equilateral triangle. 5. **Covering the Base:**    We need to verify that these three circles, each of radius (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), entirely cover the base of the cylinder. This can be checked as follows:    - The side length (s) of the equilateral triangle inscribed in the base circle is (r sqrt{3} = sqrt{3}).    - The distance between two adjacent vertices (the centers of the spheres) of this triangle is also (sqrt{3}).    Since the diameter of each circle formed by the intersection of a sphere with the plane is:    [    2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3}    ]    and they are centered at the midpoints of the sides of the triangle, these circles cover the entire base without gaps. 6. **Height Coverage:**    The height of each sphere is chosen to be the same as the height of the cylinder, (h = 1). Thus, cylindrical sections formed at the base intersect exactly at these spherical sections covering the height. 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the entire cylinder is covered by the three spheres, and it is not possible to cover the cylinder with fewer than three spheres. Two spheres cannot cover the cylinder because their cross-sectional circles will overlap and leave parts of the base uncovered.    Thus, the minimum number of spheres required to cover the cylinder is:    [    boxed{3}    ]"},{"instruction":"Given is an acute triangle  ABC   left(AB<AC<BCright) ,inscribed in circle  c(O,R) .The perpendicular bisector of the angle bisector  AD   left(Din BCright)  intersects  c  at  K,L  ( K  lies on the small arc  overarc{AB} ).The circle  c_1(K,KA)  intersects  c  at  T  and the circle  c_2(L,LA)  intersects  c  at  S .Prove that  angle{BAT}=angle{CAS} . <details><summary>Diagram</summary>[asy]import graph; size(10cm);  real labelscalefactor = 0.5; /* changes labeltopoint distance */ pen dps = linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); /* default pen style */  pen dotstyle = black; /* point style */  real xmin = 6.94236331697463, xmax = 15.849400903703716, ymin = 5.002235438802758, ymax = 7.893104843949444;  /* image dimensions */ pen aqaqaq = rgb(0.6274509803921569,0.6274509803921569,0.6274509803921569); pen uququq = rgb(0.25098039215686274,0.25098039215686274,0.25098039215686274); pen qqqqtt = rgb(0.,0.,0.2);  draw((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345)(0.,0.)(6.,0.)cycle, aqaqaq);  draw(arc((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345),0.6426249310341638,117.14497824050169,101.88970202103212)(1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345)cycle, qqqqtt);  draw(arc((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345),0.6426249310341638,55.85706977865775,40.60179355918817)(1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345)cycle, qqqqtt);   /* draw figures */ draw((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345)(0.,0.), uququq);  draw((0.,0.)(6.,0.), uququq);  draw((6.,0.)(1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345), uququq);  draw(circle((3.,0.7178452373968209), 3.0846882800136055));  draw((2.5345020274407277,0.)(1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345));  draw(circle((0.01850947366601585,1.3533783539547308), 2.889550258039566));  draw(circle((5.553011501106743,2.4491551634556963), 3.887127532933951));  draw((0.01850947366601585,1.3533783539547308)(5.553011501106743,2.4491551634556963), linetype(2 2));  draw((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345)(0.7798408954511686,1.423695174396108));  draw((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345)(5.22015910454883,1.4236951743961088));   /* dots and labels */ dot((1.8318261909633622,3.572783369254345),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( A , (1.5831274347452782,3.951671933606579), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((0.,0.),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( B , (0.6,0.05), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((6.,0.),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( C , (6.188606107156787,0.07450151636712989), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((2.5345020274407277,0.),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( D , (2.3,0.7), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((0.01850947366601585,1.3533783539547308),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( K , (0.3447473583572136,1.6382221818835927), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((5.553011501106743,2.4491551634556963),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( L , (5.631664500260511,2.580738747400365), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((0.7798408954511686,1.423695174396108),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( T , (0.5977692071595602,1.960477431907719), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((5.22015910454883,1.4236951743961088),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label( S , (5.160406217502124,1.8747941077698307), NE * labelscalefactor);  clip((xmin,ymin)(xmin,ymax)(xmax,ymax)(xmax,ymin)cycle);   /* end of picture */[/asy]</details>","output":"1. **Define Points and Intersections:**    Let M be the point where the angle bisector AD intersects the circumcircle odot(ABC) again.

This is because L is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A, making L equidistant from B and C. Therefore, L lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC, and LD is the angle bisector of angle BLC. 3. **Angle Chasing:**    From the cyclic quadrilateral BT'LD, we have:    [    180^circ - angle BT'L = angle BAL = angle DBL    ]    This implies:    [    angle BT'D = angle BDT'    ]    Hence, BD = BT', which means T' lies on the circle centered at L with radius LA.

Therefore, S' = S. 5. **Parallel Lines:**    Since MT = MS and MB = MC, it follows that TS parallel BC.

Thus the total in Case 1 is: [6 times 9^2 times 9^2 = 6 times 6561 = 39366 text{ combinations}] **Case 2 Analysis**: For the selection process where two departments contribute one man and one woman: - There are {{4}choose{2}} = 6 ways to choose which two departments will follow this pattern.  - From each of these departments, the number of ways to pick one man and one woman is 9. - The remaining two departments will contribute two men from one department and two women from the other. Choosing which department contributes two men can be done in 2 ways (as the other automatically contributes two women). Each selection inside these departments can be done in {{3}choose{2}} times {{3}choose{2}} = 9 ways.  So the total number for Case 2 is: [6 times 9 times 9 times 2 times 9 times 9 = 8748 text{ combinations}] Adding the results from both cases provides the total number of ways to form the committee: [39366 + 8748 = boxed{48114}]"},{"instruction":"f an integer is divisible by 4 and the sum of its last two digits is 14, what is the product of its last two digits?","output":"We define A as the tens digit and B the units digit of a two-digit number AB.

Since the area of a square is given by the formula ( A = s^2 ), where ( s ) is the length of one side of the square, we can find the length of one side by taking the square root of the area. The area of the square field is 7201 sq m, so the length of one side of the square is: [ s = sqrt{7201} ] [ s = 85 text{ m} ] Now, the diagonal of a square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the diagonal ( d ) is ( d = ssqrt{2} ), since the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the sides of the square. So the diagonal of the field is: [ d = 85sqrt{2} ] [ d approx 85 times 1.414 ] [ d approx 120.19 text{ m} ] Now, we need to convert the lady's walking speed to meters per hour to match the units of the diagonal's length. Her speed on flat ground is 2.4 km/hr, which is: [ 2.4 text{ km/hr} times 1000 text{ m/km} = 2400 text{ m/hr} ] Since her speed reduces to 75% of her original speed due to obstacles and uneven terrain, her reduced speed is: [ 2400 text{ m/hr} times 0.75 = 1800 text{ m/hr} ] Now we can calculate the time it takes for her to cross the field diagonally at the reduced speed.

On the last day, they only had to clean 30 acres, which means they had already cleaned ( A - 30 ) acres by then. Since they cleaned at a rate of 90 acres per day for ( D - 1 ) days (every day except the last one), we can write the following equation: [ (D - 1) times 90 + 30 = A ] We also know that if they had continued at the original rate of 80 acres per day for ( D ) days, they would have cleaned the same total amount of acres: [ D times 80 = A ] Now we have two equations: 1.

The first multiple of 10 within this range is -1,000 and the last multiple is 1,000. Since we are dealing with multiples of 10, the sequence will be -1,000, -990, -980, ..., 0, ..., 980, 990, 1,000. This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 10.

Prove that the radius of the circumcircle of triangle (ABC) is smaller than the radius of the circumcircle of triangle (DEF). (A. Kuznetsov)","output":"**First Solution:** 1. Consider three spheres Omega_{1}, Omega_{2}, and Omega_{3}, which are tangent to the plane alpha at points D, E, and F, respectively. 2. Let the spheres be tangent externally at points A, B, and C. Define beta as the plane perpendicular to alpha that contains the line DE. 3. The centers of spheres Omega_{1} and Omega_{2} and the point C all lie on the plane beta. 4. Assume this plane intersects spheres Omega_{1} and Omega_{2} along circles omega_{1} and omega_{2}. The line DE is their common external tangent, and hence they touch at the point C. 5. Let the common tangent of these circles at point C intersect the segment DE at the point M. Then MD = MC = ME. 6. Denote O as the center of the circumscribed circle of triangle DEF, with radius R. If O ne M, then M is the midpoint of segment DE, so angle OME = 90^circ. Since alpha perp beta, we have angle OMC = 90^circ. 7. Consequently, right triangles OMC and OME are congruent by side-angle-side criterion, thus OC = OE = R. Similarly, if O = M, then OC = R. 8. Hence, on the sphere Omega with center O and radius R, the point C lies on it. Analogously, points A and B also lie on this sphere. 9. Therefore, the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC must also lie on sphere Omega, implying that its radius is at most R. 10. Finally, since points A, B, and C lie in one half-space relative to plane alpha, the center O does not lie in plane ABC. Hence, the inequality is strict. blacksquare 11. **Conclusion:** The radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is less than the radius of the circumcircle of triangle DEF. # Second Solution: 1. Let O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3} be the centers of spheres Omega_{1}, Omega_{2}, Omega_{3} respectively, with points of tangency A, B, C respectively on segments O_{2}O_{3}, O_{3}O_{1}, O_{1}O_{2}. 2. Points A, B, C are such that O_{1}B = O_{1}C, O_{2}C = O_{2}A, O_{3}A = O_{3}B. 3. Hence, these points are tangency points of the incircle of triangle O_{1}O_{2}O_{3} with its sides, meaning the incircle is also the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 4. Note that points D, E, F are projections of points O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3} onto plane alpha.  5. Under this projection, the incircle gamma of triangle O_{1}O_{2}O_{3} becomes a curve lying inside triangle DEF. 6. Let d be the diameter of gamma parallel to plane alpha.

Therefore, the diameter of omega is greater than d, which implies boxed{R}. blacksquare **Conclusion:** The incircle of triangle O_{1}O_{2}O_{3} remains inside the circumcircle of triangle DEF after projection, proving that the circumradius R of triangle DEF is strictly greater than the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC."},{"instruction":"1994 girls are seated at a round table.

As a variant, take 1991 girls and show that the game cannot terminate for ( n leq 1991 ).","output":"Let's reconsider the problem and break down the solution into detailed steps and explanations to make it easier to follow.  1. Definitions and Initial Setup We are given: 1. 1994 girls seated at a round table. 2. Each girl may pass tokens to their adjacent neighbors as per defined rules:    - A girl holding more than one token passes one token to each of her neighbors during her turn. The task is to prove: - If (n < 1994), the game must terminate. - If (n = 1994), the game cannot terminate. Additionally, for a variant with 1991 girls: - Prove the game cannot terminate if (n = 1991). # Case 1: (n < 1994)  2. Establish Marking of Tokens Suppose: - We mark a token the first time it is passed between any two adjacent girls A and B. - We ensure that once a token is marked, it only travels between A and B and does not get passed to any other girl. Let’s apply this marking to each pair of adjacent girls.  3. Limited Tokens Inference Since there are fewer than 1994 tokens (i.e., (n < 1994)), there must be fewer than 1994 marked tokens. This implies at least one pair of adjacent girls will never pass a token to each other.  4. Contradiction Argument Assume the game does not terminate: - There would have to be at least one girl who passes tokens infinitely many times. - If such a girl is adjacent to another girl who only passes a finite number of times, the latter would eventually accumulate an infinite number of tokens, which contradicts the maximum of (n) tokens. Thus, the game must terminate for (n < 1994). # Case 2: (n = 1994)  5. Labeling and S Calculation Label the girls from 1 to 1994. Define (c_i) as the number of tokens held by girl (i), and set: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{1994} i c_i ]  6. Change in (S) During Token Passing When any girl (i) (for (1 < i < 1994)) passes tokens, (S) remains unchanged. If girl 1 passes tokens, (S) increases by 1994. Conversely, if girl 1994 passes tokens, (S) decreases by 1994. Since 1994 is even, and any change in (S) from passing tokens by boundary girls involves multiples of 1994, (S) remains a multiple of 1994. Initially: [ S = 1994i ]  (for some integer (i)), hence a multiple of 1994. # 7. Game Termination Contradiction If the game terminates: - Each girl would eventually hold exactly 1 token. - The sum (S) at termination would equal: [ sum_{i=1}^{1994} i = frac{1994 times 1995}{2} = 1994 times 997.5 ]  (odd number). Since (S) was initially a multiple of 1994, it cannot change to this sum through the token passing process, which contradicts our initial conditions. Hence, the game cannot terminate for (n = 1994). # Variant: 1991 Girls  8. Analogy and Case Setup for n <= 1991 The argument for (n < 1991) parallels the (n < 1994) case and thus the game must terminate.  For (n = 1991), let's examine potential game outcomes similarly by ensuring alternating girl interactions. # 9. Example Demonstration Label the girls: [ -995, -994, ldots, -1, 0, 1, ldots, 995 ] - Let girl 0 start with all tokens. - Implement alternating token passing so that each girl (-i) passes exactly when girl (i) passes. This symmetry will ensure an eventual even distribution and termination: - Girl 0 will always have an odd number of tokens and can mark 1, maintaining an even-distributed end state. Thus resulting in termination after finitely many moves confirming our stated conditions. # Conclusion For given conditions: - (n < 1994 Rightarrow) Game must terminate. - (n = 1994 Rightarrow) Game cannot terminate. - (n leq 1991) with 1991 girls (Rightarrow) Game cannot be non-terminating.

Therefore, we need to consider all binary numbers from ( 1 ) to ( 2048 ), which range from ( 1 ) bit to ( 12 ) bits in length. 3. **Counting the Bits:**    - The binary representation of ( 2048 ) is ( 100000000000 ), which has ( 1 ) followed by ( 11 ) zeros.    - The binary representation of ( 2047 ) is ( 11111111111 ), which has ( 11 ) ones. 4. **Constructing the String:**    To ensure that the string ( s ) contains all binary representations of numbers from ( 1 ) to ( 2048 ), we need to consider the maximum number of zeros and ones that can appear in any of these binary numbers.    - The maximum number of zeros in any binary number up to ( 2048 ) is ( 11 ) (as seen in ( 2048 )).    - The maximum number of ones in any binary number up to ( 2048 ) is ( 11 ) (as seen in ( 2047 )). 5. **Combining the Bits:**    To ensure that all binary numbers are contained, we need a string that has at least ( 11 ) zeros and ( 11 ) ones. However, we need to ensure that these bits are arranged in such a way that all possible combinations of binary numbers up to ( 2048 ) are included. 6. **Constructing the Shortest String:**    - One way to construct such a string is to alternate between zeros and ones, ensuring that we have enough of each to cover all possible binary numbers.    - A string of length ( 22 ) with alternating zeros and ones would be ( 1010101010101010101010 ). 7. **Verification:**    - This string contains ( 11 ) zeros and ( 11 ) ones.    - It ensures that all binary numbers up to ( 2048 ) can be found as subsequences.

Consider the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. 2. **Verify the Perimeter with Smallest Primes:**    - To find the smallest perimeter, we need to consider the smallest distinct prime numbers: 2, 3, and 5. 3. **Evaluate the Triangle Inequality:**    - Check if 2, 3, and 5 can form a triangle via the triangle inequality:      - (2 + 3 > 5)      - (2 + 5 > 3)      - (3 + 5 > 2)    The first inequality (2 + 3 = 5) does not satisfy the strict inequality (2 + 3 > 5).    Therefore, sides (2, 3, 5) do NOT form a triangle. 4. **Next Set of Smallest Primes:**    - Consider the next smallest primes following 2, 3, and 5:      - The next primes are 3, 5, and 7. 5. **Evaluate the Triangle Inequality Again:**    - Check the perimeter for 3, 5, and 7:      - (3 + 5 > 7 )      - (3 + 7 > 5 )      - (5 + 7 > 3 )    All fulfil the triangle inequality, so these sides can form a triangle. 6. **Calculate the Perimeter:**    [    3 + 5 + 7 = 15    ] 7. **Confirm Smaller Possible Values:**    - Sides other than (3,5,7):      - The triangle with prime 2 would fail due to mismatch with other odd primes forming (2 + (odd prime) leq odd prime).    - This shows (3, 5, 7) are the smallest effective scalene primes sides forming a valid triangle. **Conclusion:**    [boxed{15}]"},{"instruction":"Given that α is in (0, π) and cosα = frac{15}{17}, find the value of sin(frac{π}{2} + α) • tan(π + α) = (   ) A: frac{15}{17} B: frac{15}{17} C: frac{8}{17} D: frac{8}{17}","output":"Solution: sin(frac{π}{2} + α) • tan(π + α) = cosα • tanα = sinα, Given that α is in (0, π) and cosα = -frac{15}{17}, Hence, sinα = sqrt{1 - (-frac{15}{17})^2} = frac{8}{17}, Therefore, the answer is: boxed{text{D}}.

Since 3/4 of the students looked up, we calculate: 3/4 * 200 = 150 students looked up. Out of these 150 students, 20 were wearing eyepatches over one eye. This means that these 20 students only used one eye to look at the plane. So for these 20 students, only 20 eyes saw the plane. The remaining students who looked up were not wearing eyepatches, so they would have used both eyes. There were 150 - 20 = 130 students without eyepatches. Since each of these students has two eyes, the number of eyes that saw the plane from these students is: 130 students * 2 eyes/student = 260 eyes. Now, we add the number of eyes from the students with eyepatches to the number of eyes from the students without eyepatches to get the total number of eyes that saw the plane: 20 eyes (from students with eyepatches) + 260 eyes (from students without eyepatches) = 280 eyes.

Since 420 students were absent, the number of students who received fruits is ( S - 420 ). The total number of bananas actually distributed is ( (2S + 4(S - 420)) ), apples are ( (S + 2(S - 420)) ), and oranges are ( (S + (S - 420)) ). The total number of fruits should be the same whether the 420 students were absent or not, so we can set up the following equations: For bananas: [ 2S = 2S + 4(S - 420) ] For apples: [ S = S + 2(S - 420) ] For oranges: [ S = S + (S - 420) ] However, we only need to solve one of these equations because the total number of fruits remains the same. Let's solve the equation for bananas: [ 2S = 2S + 4(S - 420) ] [ 2S = 2S + 4S - 1680 ] [ 2S - 2S = 4S - 2S - 1680 ] [ 0 = 2S - 1680 ] [ 2S = 1680 ] [ S = frac{1680}{2} ] [ S = 840 ] So, the actual number of students in the school is boxed{840} ."},{"instruction":"Given that x and y are rational numbers, a new operation * is defined such that x*y=frac{xy}{x+y} (where xy represents the product of x and y).

Next, to find the minimum value of |PM| cdot |PN|, we first express line l in slope-intercept form passing through point P(-4,6): y - 6 = k(x + 4) For the intersection with line l_1: x = -1, we set x = -1 in the equation of line l: y = 3k + 6 Therefore, point M is M(-1, 3k + 6). For the intersection with line l_2: y = -1, we set y = -1 in the equation of line l: -1 - 6 = k(x + 4) implies x = -frac{7}{k} - 4 Therefore, point N is N(-frac{7}{k} - 4, -1).

Here's how to count the divisors for each number: 1. Simple integers like 1, 2, 3, ..., 20 are checked. 2. For numbers that aren't prime, decompose them into prime factors and use the formula for finding divisors from prime factorization.

First, let's find out how much the servant would earn in a year. He was promised Rs 90 for the year plus a bag. Since he only worked for 9 months, we need to calculate 9/12 (or 3/4) of the yearly salary: ( frac{3}{4} times 90 = 67.5 ) So, for 9 months of work, he should have earned Rs 67.5 in cash. However, he was given Rs 65 in cash and a turban instead of the full Rs 67.5.

The piece can move to the square to its right, the square above it, or the square diagonally up and to the right (if such squares exist). The winner is the player who moves the piece to the topright corner. With optimal play, does the starting player or their opponent win? How should the winning player play?","output":"1. **Identify Winning and Losing Positions:**    - We start by analyzing the end goal, which is the top-right corner of the chessboard.    - Let us denote the top-right corner square as the target square.    - The positions that are one move away from the target square are winning positions because the current player can immediately move the piece into the target square and win the game. These squares are the ones immediately to the left, directly below, and diagonally below-left of the target square. We label these squares as \\"1.\\" 2. **Marking Losing Positions:**    - From these winning positions, we can find the losing positions for the opponent.    - A losing position is any position where all possible moves would lead to a winning position for the opponent.    - For example, if the piece is on a square from where any move puts it on a \\"1\\"-marked square (winning position), then this square is a losing position. Mark these squares as \\"2.\\" 3. **Iterate for Further Positions:**    - Repeat the process for identifying winning and losing positions:      - Squares from which any move leads to a \\"2\\" (losing position) are winning positions, and we mark them with \\"3.\\"      - Squares from which any move leads to a \\"3\\" (winning position) are losing positions, and we mark them with \\"4.\\"    - Continue this process until all squares on the board are marked appropriately as either winning or losing positions. Refer to the diagram to encode this. 4. **Determine the Starting Position:**    - The lower-left corner of the board is the starting position of the piece.    - Check the marking of this starting position in the completed chessboard diagram. If it is a marked winning square, the player who starts the game can always win with the correct strategy. 5. **Strategy for the First Player:**    - Ensure the opponent always finds themselves on a losing position.    - One effective strategy for the first player is to move diagonally up and to the right on their first move.    - Afterward, the first player mimics the opponent's move (if the opponent moves up, the first player does the same; if the opponent moves to the right, the first player does the same). This ensures that the opponent always ends up on a losing position. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Since the starting position is marked as a winning square based on our backward induction process, the first player can always enforce a strategy that forces the opponent to be on losing positions continuously.    - Thus, following optimal play, the first player will always win.

We need to prove that at least two of these points are at most 1 unit distance apart. 2. **Dividing the Unit Circle:**     - Divide the unit circle into six sectors each with a central angle of (60^circ). Each sector is a circular segment (also called a wedge or sector) with an arc subtending (60^circ) at the center. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle:**     - According to the pigeonhole principle, if you place 6 points into 6 regions (the 6 sectors), there must be at least one region that contains at least one point. However, in this case, we will consider a more refined analysis involving neighboring sectors. 4. **Special Consideration of Center Point (O):**     - Select one of the six points, say (A).      - If (A) coincides with the center (O) of the circle, the conclusion is immediately satisfied because the maximum distance from (O) to any point within the unit circle is 1. 5. **Case when (A) is not the center (O):**     - Assume (A) is not the center. We repeatedly consider the 6 regions defined by (60^circ).     - Use the explanation given in the reference solution: if one of the sectors contains another point, the maximum distance within any (60^circ) sector of the unit circle is less than or equal to the length of the chord formed by (60^circ) arc which is (1). 6. **Edge Case with Common Radius:**     - Focus on cases where a point lies on the boundary of two adjacent sectors. Specifically, if a point lies on the common radius of two adjacent sectors, and if another point is also located in either of these two adjacent sectors, their distance can still be shown to be at most 1. 7. **Remaining Points:**     - If no other points are in the shadowed regions (sectors containing (A)), the remaining points (5 in total) must be within the other 4 sectors.     - By the pigeonhole principle again, placing 5 points into 4 sectors implies that at least one sector must contain at least two of these points. 8. **Conclude:**     - Therefore, any scenario will lead to the conclusion that at least two points among the six points are within a distance of at most 1 from each other.

If no promotional activities are conducted, the annual sales can only reach 1 (10,000 units). Considering that the fixed costs, including depreciation of equipment and maintenance, are 30,000 Yuan, and the production cost for every 10,000 units is 320,000 Yuan, if the selling price per unit is set as the sum of 150% of the production cost per unit and half of the average promotional cost per unit, then all produced cosmetics will be sold out for that year.

This means that for each (a_i), the numbers (a_i - i, a_i - (i-1), ldots, a_i, ldots, a_i + (i-1), a_i + i) are all composite (not prime). 3. **Existence of Such (a_i):**    We can find such (a_i) because there are arbitrarily large gaps between consecutive prime numbers. This is a known result in number theory. Specifically, for any positive integer (n), there exists a sequence of (n) consecutive composite numbers. This can be seen by considering the sequence ((n+1)! + 2, (n+1)! + 3, ldots, (n+1)! + (n+1)), which are all composite. 4. **Constructing (a_i):**    For each (i), we can choose (a_i) such that the numbers (a_i - i, a_i - (i-1), ldots, a_i, ldots, a_i + (i-1), a_i + i) are all composite. This ensures that for any integer (k), the number (a_i + k) will be prime for only finitely many (i). 5. **Verification:**    Given any integer (k), consider the sequence (a_1 + k, a_2 + k, a_3 + k, ldots). Since each (a_i) is chosen such that (a_i + j) is not prime for (|j| leq i), it follows that (a_i + k) will be composite for all (i) sufficiently large (specifically, for (i geq |k|)). Therefore, only finitely many of the numbers (a_1 + k, a_2 + k, a_3 + k, ldots) can be prime.

The next stop is exactly 1 km away.    - The boy can see the bus from a distance of 2 km.    - The boy runs 4 times slower than the bus.    - If the bus comes while the boy is walking, he needs to be able to either catch the bus or return to the current stop without missing the bus. 2. **Define Variables:**    Let ( v ) be the speed of the bus and ( v_b = frac{v}{4} ) be the speed of the boy.     These are given conditions:    - Distance between stops: ( 1 ) km    - Distance the boy can see the bus: ( 2 ) km 3. **Case 1: Boy and bus moving towards each other:**    If the boy sees the bus approaching from the front:        - The boy and the bus move towards each other at a combined speed of ( v + v_b = v + frac{v}{4} = frac{5v}{4} ).    - Let the distance between them be ( 2 ) km initially.

Let's go through the steps of proving that the circumcircles of triangles (DUP), (ESQ), and (FTR) have a single point in common. 1. **Determine reflections of points:**    - Identify that (D) and (P) are on side (BC) with (I) as their center, making (D) nearer to (B) than (P).    - Similarly, (E) is nearer to (C) than (Q) on side (CA), and (F) is nearer to (A) than (R) on side (AB).    - By the properties of the circle centered at (I), (D) and (P) can be seen as reflections of (Q) and (E) respectively across the line (CI). 2. **Intersection and cyclicity condition:**    - Since (PQ) and (DE) reflect symmetrically across (CI), their intersection (U) must lie on (CI).    - Considering the center (I) and point (P), angle relationships are established as follows:      [      angle PIU = frac{1}{2} angle PIE = angle PDE = angle PDU      ]    - This implies that the quadrilateral (PDIU) is cyclic. 3. **Verification for circumcircle of (DUP):**    - Since (PDIU) is cyclic, the circumcircle of (DUP) passes through (I). 4. **Similarly for other triangles:**    - Following similar reasoning for other sides:      [      angle SIU = 1/2 angle SIE = angle SEQ = angle SEI      ]    - The quadrilateral (SELI) is cyclic, implying (I) lies on the circumcircle of (ESQ).    - For (FTR),      [      angle TIU = 1/2 angle TIF = angle TFQ = angle TFI      ]    - The quadrilateral (TFPI) is cyclic, indicating that (I) lies on the circumcircle of (FTR). 5. **Common intersection points:**    - Since (I) lies on all these circumcircles, (I) is a common point.    - Further, for intersection points of specific lines:      - (DPIT) cyclic implies (T) lies on the circle through (D, P, I).      - (EISP) cyclic implies (S) lies on the circle through (E, S, I).      - (UISP) cyclic implies (U) lies on the circle through (U, I, S). 6. **Conclusion:**    - Each pair of circumcircles intersects at (I) along with one other point (either (S), (T), or (U)).    - Thus, the three circumcircles of (DUP), (ESQ), and (FTR) must intersect at a single common point, (I).

Given a chessboard of size (8 times 8), we aim to place the maximum number of queens on black squares such that every queen can be attacked by at least one other queen.    2. Notice that the chessboard (8 times 8) has alternating black and white squares, and thus half of them, i.e., 32 squares, are black. 3. Consider the configuration of queens on the edge squares of the chessboard. A queen on the edge can only be attacked by another queen if there is at least one queen in the same row, column, or diagonal within the inner part of the board.

Each (3 times 3) square contains 5 black squares and 4 white squares. 6. Suppose we place more than 4 queens in one of these (3 times 3) sub-squares.

Firstly, let's consider the roles that A can assume: - A can be a tour guide, a ceremonial officer, or a driver. Case 1: A is a tour guide. - In this case, B has 3 options: translator, ceremonial officer, or driver. However, since B cannot be a tour guide and A is already the tour guide, B has in fact only 2 options: ceremonial officer or driver. - After B chooses one of the 2 remaining roles, C and D only have 2 left roles to choose from. - Therefore, the number of combinations for this case is: 2 possibilities for B * 2! (2 factorial for the combinations for C and D). - This results in 2 * 2! = 2 * (2 * 1) = 4 possible combinations. Case 2: A is not a tour guide. - A has 2 remaining options: ceremonial officer or driver. - Since A is not a tour guide, B still cannot be a tour guide and also cannot take the role A has taken, leaving B with 2 options as well. - After A and B have chosen their roles, C and D have 2 roles to choose from, which can be arranged in 2! ways. - The number of combinations for this case is: 2 possibilities for A * 2 possibilities for B * 2! (combinations for C and D). - This results in 2 * 2 * 2! = 2 * 2 * (2 * 1) = 8 possible combinations. Adding the two cases together, we find the total number of different possible combinations: 4 + 8 = 12. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let's take another look at Case 1 to verify the calculations: Revisiting Case 1, assuming A is a tour guide: - In fact, B should have 3 options, because B cannot be a tour guide. But here, A is already assigned as the tour guide, which means B cannot choose this role by default, and there is no need to explicitly disqualify B from being a guide. Therefore, there are indeed 3 roles left for B. - After B has chosen one of the 3 roles, C and D have 2 roles left to choose from, which can be done in 2! ways. - The corrected number of combinations for this case is: 3 possibilities for B * 2! (combinations for C and D). - This leads to 3 * 2! = 3 * (2 * 1) = 6 possible combinations. Now we sum up the correct numbers for Case 1 and Case 2: 6 + 8 = 14. Hence, the total number of different possible combinations is boxed{14}.

It is connected to 7 other vertices with blue edges.      - The remaining 10 blue edges must form connections among these 7 vertices.      - Each blue edge among these 7 vertices forms a blue triangle with A.      - Therefore, there are at least 10 blue triangles in this case, which is more than 4.    - **Case 2: There is a vertex with degree 6.**      - Let this vertex be A, and let A_1, A_2, ldots, A_6 be the vertices connected to A by blue edges.      - There are binom{6}{2} = 15 edges among A_1, A_2, ldots, A_6.      - Since there are only 11 red edges in total, at most 10 of these 15 edges can be red.      - Therefore, at least 5 of these edges are blue.      - Each blue edge among A_1, A_2, ldots, A_6 forms a blue triangle with A.      - Thus, there are at least 5 blue triangles in this case, which is more than 4.    - **Case 3: No vertex has degree 6 or more.**      - By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two vertices with degree 5.      - Let these vertices be A and B.      - **Subcase 3.1: AB is blue.**        - A and B are each connected to 5 other vertices with blue edges.        - They must share at least 2 common vertices connected by blue edges.        - If they share 4 common vertices, we have 4 blue triangles immediately.        - If they share exactly 3 common vertices, say C, D, E, we have 3 blue triangles: ABC, ABD, ABE.        - Among the edges CD, DE, EC, at least one must be blue, forming the 4th blue triangle.        - If they share exactly 2 common vertices, say C and D, we have 2 blue triangles: ABC, ABD.        - There are 10 edges among the vertices connected to A and B.        - Since there are only 7 red edges left, at least 3 of these 10 edges must be blue, forming at least 3 more blue triangles.      - **Subcase 3.2: AB is red.**        - A and B are each connected to 5 other vertices with blue edges.        - They must share at least 4 common vertices connected by blue edges.        - If they share 5 common vertices, there are 10 edges among these 5 vertices, and at least 2 must be blue, forming 4 blue triangles.        - If they share exactly 4 common vertices, say C, D, E, F, there are 6 edges among these 4 vertices.        - Since there are only 8 red edges left, at least 2 of these 6 edges must be blue, forming at least 4 blue triangles. # Part 2: Proving that four cannot be substituted by five 1. **Counterexample:**    - Consider the complete graph with 8 vertices labeled A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4.    - Color the edges A_iB_j blue for all i, j and color A_1A_2 blue.    - The remaining edges are red.    - There are exactly 17 blue edges and 4 blue triangles: A_1A_2B_i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.    - This configuration shows that it is possible to have exactly 4 blue triangles and no more.

Thus, if the initial sum of the integers in the white cubes is not divisible by 3, it will never become divisible by 3. Therefore, if at the starting configuration the sum of the integers in the white cubes is not divisible by 3, the goal state where all integers in all cubes (white and black) are divisible by 3 is not achievable. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"F is a field in which 1 + 1 ≠ 0.

From this, the sum of peaches received by the four girls is:    [    a + b + c + d = 10    ] 7. Now we have two equations:    [    2a + 3b + 4c + 5d = 32    ]    [    a + b + c + d = 10    ] 8. Subtract the second equation from the first:    [    (2a + 3b + 4c + 5d) - (a + b + c + d) = 32 - 10    ]    [    a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 22    ] 9. We need to find integers ( a, b, c, d ) (each being one of 1, 2, 3, or 4) that satisfy these equations. We also noted that ( b ) and ( d ) must be of the same parity (to ensure integer solutions). 10. Let's try different combinations for ( a ) and ( c ):     - If ( a = 3 ) and ( c = 1 ):       [       a + b + c + d = 10 implies 3 + b + 1 + d = 10 implies b + d = 6       ]       [       a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 22 implies 3 + 2b + 3 times 1 + 4d = 22 implies 2b + 4d = 16 implies b + 2d = 8       ]       Now check both equations:       [       b + d = 6       ]       [       b + 2d = 8       ]       Solving the system of linear equations:       Subtract the first from the second:       [       b + 2d - (b + d) = 8 - 6 implies d = 2       ]       Substitute ( d = 2 ) into ( b + d = 6 ):       [       b + 2 = 6 implies b = 4       ] 11. We have ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ), ( c = 1 ), and ( d = 2 ). 12. Check total:     [     2a + 3b + 4c + 5d = 2 times 3 + 3 times 4 + 4 times 1 + 5 times 2 = 6 + 12 + 4 + 10 = 32     ]     This matches the original total. 13.

The tower is considered stable if every internal grid point of the (10 times 11) rectangle (excluding boundary points) is covered by the interior point of a domino. 2. **Horizontal and Vertical Pair Definitions:**    There are 99 horizontal pairs of contiguous cells and 100 vertical pairs within a (10 times 11) grid.    3. **Existence of a 5-Level Stable Tower:**    To show that a 5-level tower is possible, we proceed as follows:        - **Levels for Vertical Pairs:**      The first two levels of the tower will be arranged to cover all 100 vertical pairs. Each domino can cover one vertical pair.    - **Levels for Horizontal Pairs:**      We need three additional levels to adequately cover all horizontal pairs.      - **Third Level:** Cover the (10 times 11) grid with horizontal dominoes.      - **Fourth Level:** Exclude the rightmost and leftmost columns as well as the top row; cover the remaining (8 times 10) grid with horizontal dominoes.      - **Fifth Level:** Exclude the leftmost and rightmost columns and the bottom row; use horizontal dominoes to cover all remaining horizontal pairs.     4. **Verify the 5-Level Stability:**    We have covered all cells such that every contiguous internal pair of grid points has an interior point of a domino covering them. 5. **Proof that a 4-Level Stable Tower Does Not Exist:**    Argue by contradiction:        - Consider a simplified scenario where each internal cell has 4 neighbors (non-boundary cells).    - In a 4-level tower, each neighbor must be covered by different dominos due to the stability requirement.    For boundary and corner cells:        - Corner cells covered by two adjacent dominos will result in one neighbor not being paired correctly.    - For edge cells (excluding corners), if they are double-covered by two dominos, it leaves one neighbor wrongly paired. 6. **Conclusion:**    After considering all the internal and boundary conditions, a 4-level stable tower cannot possibly cover all internal grid points as required. Hence, the minimal number of levels required for a stable tower configuration is (boxed{5})."},{"instruction":"the market, the supply of light bulbs from Factory A accounts for 70%, while those from Factory B account for 30%.

Consider a triangulation consisting of (n) triangles.        2. Remove a triangle from this triangulation that has one side lying on the boundary of the polygon. This is always possible because every triangulated polygon has at least one such triangle.        3. The remaining part of the triangulation now consists of (n-1) triangles.

When 0 < x < frac{1}{a}, f'(x)= frac{1-ax}{x} > 0; When x > frac{1}{a}, f'(x)= frac{1-ax}{x} < 0, hence the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, frac{1}{a}] and monotonically decreasing on the interval [frac{1}{a},+infty). (2)(i) When frac{1}{a}leqslant 1, i.e., ageqslant 1, the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval [1,2], so the minimum value of f(x) is f(2)=ln 2-2a.

Notice that the system is symmetric in the pairs ( (x, y) ) and ( (z, t) ). This symmetry implies that if ((x, y)) and ((z, t)) are solutions, then ((y, x)) and ((t, z)) are also solutions. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume ( x leq y ) and ( z leq t ). Additionally, due to the symmetries in the equations, we can assume ( x leq z ). 2. Let's first look for solutions where ( x = 1 ). This simplifies the system to: [ 1 + y = z t quad text{and} quad z + t = y ] 3. We eliminate ( y ) by using both equations. From the second equation, we get ( y = z + t ). Substituting this into the first equation, we obtain: [ 1 + (z + t) = z t ] Rearranging the terms, we get: [ 1 + z + t = z t ] 4. We solve this equation by dividing both sides by ( z-1 ) (assuming ( z neq 1 )): [ t = frac{z + 1}{z - 1} ] This can be rewritten as: [ t = 1 + frac{2}{z-1} ] Since ( t ) must be a natural number, ( frac{2}{z-1} ) must be an integer.

Case 2: ( z - 1 = 2 ) [ z = 3 ] [ t = 1 + frac{2}{2} = 2 ] Using the second equation, ( y = z + t = 3 + 2 = 5 ). Since ( t = 2 ) is not greater than ( z = 3 ), this solution is already considered by the symmetry of the problem. 7. Now, let's look for solutions where each variable is greater than 1: If all variables ( x, y, z, t ) are greater than 1, then ( x-1 geq 1 ) and ( y-1 geq 1 ), implying: [ (x - 1)(y - 1) geq 1 ] This translates to: [ x y geq x + y ] Similarly for ( z ) and ( t ): [ z t geq z + t ] Combining the two inequalities with the given equations: [ x y = z t quad text{and} quad x y = z t geq z + t ] Since the inequalities ( x y geq x + y ) and ( z t geq z + t ) must hold, and given ( x y = z t ), we conclude: [ x y geq x + y quad text{and} quad x y geq z + t ] 8. This implies: [ x y = x + y = z t = z + t ] 9. Given each term must be equal, we recognize: [ x - 1 = y - 1 = 1 ] Thus, ( x = y = 2 ) and similarly ( z = t = 2 ).

To understand how f(x) behaves, we find its derivative: f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{{x}^{2}}. Setting f'(x) = 0 to find critical points gives x = 1. Analyzing the sign of f'(x): - For 0 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing. - For x > 1, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing. Thus, f(x) takes its minimum value at x=1, with f(1)=1. This implies ln x > 1-frac{1}{x} for x > 0 and x neq 1. 2. **Comparing c and b:** Given c = -ln 0.9 and b = frac{1}{9}, we use the inequality ln x > 1-frac{1}{x} for x=0.9: ln 0.9 > 1 - frac{1}{0.9} = -frac{1}{9}.

Next, let's calculate the total distance Jake rows around the square lake. Since each side of the lake is 15 miles and a square has 4 sides, the total distance is 4 * 15 = 60 miles. Jake rows this 60-mile distance in 10 hours. Therefore, his rowing speed is 60 miles / 10 hours = 6 miles per hour. Now, we can find the ratio of Jake's rowing speed to his swimming speed.

The total number of ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes can be calculated using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the ways to partition a set of objects into non-empty subsets. Specifically, we need S(5,1) + S(5,2) + S(5,3), where S(n,k) is the number of ways to partition n objects into k non-empty subsets.

(3) By combining equations (1), (2), and (3), we set up a system of equations: frac{b^2}{a^2} = 3, (from substituting sqrt{3} for frac{b}{a} and squaring both sides), c^2 = a^2 + b^2, Substituting c = 4 in (2), we get: 4^2 = a^2 + b^2, 16 = a^2 + b^2. Substituting the expression for b^2 from the first equation into the second, we have: 16 = a^2 + 3a^2, 16 = 4a^2, a^2 = 4, a = 2. With a known, we can find b^2: b^2 = 3a^2 = 3 cdot 4 = 12, b = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}. The equation for the directrix of a hyperbola is x = pm frac{a^2}{c}. Now, substituting the known values of a and c into this formula, we get: x = pm frac{4}{4}, x = pm 1. Thus, the distance from the center of the hyperbola to its directrix is 1.
