Information:  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - The Euphrates (Sumerian: : \\"Buranuna\\", : \\"Purattu\\", : \\"al-Furt\\", : \\"Prt\\", : \\"Yeprat\\", : \\"Perat\\", ) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia. Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia. Originating in eastern Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.  - The Arabian Peninsula, simplified Arabia (\\"\\", « Arabian island ») is a peninsula of Western Asia situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian plate. From a geological perspective, it is considered a subcontinent of Asia.  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - The Tigris and Euphrates, with their tributaries, form a major river system in Western Asia. From sources in the Taurus mountains of eastern Turkey they flow by/through Syria through Iraq into the Persian Gulf. The system is part of the Palearctic TigrisEuphrates ecoregion, which includes Iraq and parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan.  - Yemen ('), officially known as the Republic of Yemen ('), is an Arab country in Western Asia, occupying South Arabia, the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east-northeast. Although Yemen's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015. Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra.  - A region is arid when it is characterized by a severe lack of available water, to the extent of hindering or preventing the growth and development of plant and animal life. Environments subject to arid climates tend to lack vegetation and are called xeric or desertic. Most \\"arid\\" climates surround the equator; these places include most of Africa and parts of South America, Central America and Australia.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.  - The Tigris is the eastern member of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. The river flows south from the mountains of southeastern Turkey through Iraq and empties itself into the Persian Gulf.  - The IranIraq boundary runs for 1,458 kilometers, from the Shatt al-Arab (known as Arvand Rud in Iran) waterway to the tripoint boundary with modern Turkey at the Kuh e-Dalanper. Although the boundary was first determined in 1639, certain disputes fester, particularly disputes surrounding navigation on the Shatt al-Arab waterway.  - Kuwait ('), officially the State of Kuwait ('), is a country in Western Asia. Situated in the northern edge of Eastern Arabia at the tip of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. , Kuwait has a population of 4.2 million people; 1.3 million are Kuwaitis and 2.9 million are expatriates. Expatriates account for 70% of the population.  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - Arabia Deserta ( \`\` Abandoned / deserted Arabia '' , also known as Arabia Magna ( \`\` Greater Arabia '' ) in Latin signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula . In ancient times , this land was populated by nomadic tribes who frequently invaded richer lands , such as Mesopotamia and Arabia Felix . Arabia Deserta was one of three regions into which the Romans divided the Arabian peninsula : Arabia Deserta ( or Arabia Magna ) , Arabia Felix , and Arabia Petraea . As a name for the region , it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries , and was used in Charles M. Doughty 's Travels in Arabia Deserta ( 1888 ) .  - Arabia Felix (lit. \\"Fertile Arabia\\"; also Greek: \\"Eudaimon Arabia\\") was the Latin name previously used by geographers to describe the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, a country with an extensive history.  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years.

On the left side, we see 108*l and -50*l. Skip this step for the right side since there is only one term with the variable l. 108*l - 50*l = (108-50)*l = 58*l Now our equation looks like: 58*l = -49*l - 1498 Step 2: Get all the l terms on one side of the equation. To do this, add 49*l to both sides of the equation.  58*l + 49*l = -49*l - 1498 + 49*l Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, combine the l terms. (58+49)*l = 107*l The right side remains unchanged since the 49*l terms cancelled out: 107*l = -1498 Step 4: Solve for l. To isolate l, divide both sides of the equation by 107. 107*l / 107 = -1498 / 107 l = -14 So the solution for the equation is l = -14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

LIFESTYLE The Royal Family Never Uses These 'Common' Words We Canadian non-royals use words like \\"living room\\" or \\"couch\\" regularly. But the Royal Family have their own terms for many commonly used words, according to Kate Fox, author of \\"Watching the English: The Hidden Rules Of English Behavior.\\" Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Canadian non-royals have never said the words \\"living room\\" or \\"couch.\\"\\"?","output":"Based on the paragraph above, we cannot conclude that \\"Canadian non-royals have never said the words 'living room' or 'couch'.\\" What we can infer from the text is that the Royal Family has their own terms for many commonly used words and that they might refrain from using words like \\"living room\\" and \\"couch.\\" The passage implies that these terms might be considered 'common' or less formal by the Royal Family, and they prefer using different words in their speech. However, the paragraph clearly states that Canadian non-royals, or people who are not part of the Royal Family, use words like \\"living room\\" and \\"couch\\" regularly. This means that it is a normal part of their vocabulary and speech, unlike that of the Royal Family. So, the assertion that \\"Canadian non-royals have never said the words 'living room' or 'couch'\\" is incorrect. The distinction between the terms used by the Royal Family and those used by Canadian non-royals provides insight into the cultural and social nuances that exist within the English-speaking world. Linguistic differences between various groups of people are common and can often reflect their societal status, upbringing, or personal preferences. In this case, the Royal Family is known for adhering to strict protocols and traditional customs, which could influence their choice of words in maintaining a formal and refined image. However, it is essential not to assume a universal rule based on this example. The use of language is complex and varied, even within a single country or social group. While the Royal Family might have specific preferences for their choice of words, Canadian non-royals could also display a wide range of linguistic habits based on factors like their education, regional dialects, and social background. Therefore, it would be incorrect to conclude that Canadian non-royals have never uttered the words \\"living room\\" or \\"couch\\"; the paragraph simply highlights that they use these terms regularly in contrast to the Royal Family's alternative vocabulary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - La Défense is a major business district just west of the city limits of Paris.

Q:Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. How structured was Jenny's life in school? - not enough information - She dropped out of school - She had lots of free time - Very structured A:","output":"Very structured. Jenny was an over-achiever who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat.

To absorb heat from the sun. (B). To store heat for future use. (C). To turn solar energy into heat energy. (D). To carry heat down below the surface. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Sometimes, the simplest ideas are the best. For example, to absorb heat from the sun to heat water,you need large, flat, black surfaces. One way to do that is to build those surfaces specially, on  the roofs of buildings. But why go to all that trouble when cities are full of black surfaces already, in the form of asphalt   roads? Ten years ago, this thought came into the mind of Arian de Bondt, a Dutch engineer. He finally persuaded his boss to follow it up. The result is that their building is now heated in winter and cooled in summer by a system that relies on the surface of the road outside. The heat-collector is a system of connected water pipes. Most of them run from one side of the street to the other, just under the asphalt road. Some, however, dive deep into the groun. When the street surface gets hot in summer, water pumped through the pipes picks up this heat and takes itunderground through one of the diving pipes. At a depth of 100 metres lies a natural aquifer  into which heat several heat exchangers   have been built. The hot water from the street runs through these exchangers, warming the ground-water, before returning to the surface through another pipe. The aquifer is thus used as a heat store. In winter, the working system is changed slightly. Water is pumped through the heat exchangers to pick up the heat stored during summer. This water goes into the building and is used to warm the place up. After performing that task, it is pumped under the asphalt and its remaining heat keeps the road free of snow and ice. Question: For what purpose are the diving pipes used? Answer: A:","output":"(D). To carry heat down below the surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He spends the night at Independence newspaperman Peter Sharpe's place, but is jailed when daughter Cathy Sharpe finds this total stranger in her room.

Peter's business is threatened by banker Stone unless he takes Taylor's side against \\"squatters\\" settling in the region. The blind and wheelchair-bound Taylor and ambitious daughter Norah are secretly aware that railroad surveyors are considering laying tracks nearby, so they want all the land for themselves.

Most rely on external funding (government funds, grants from charitable foundations, direct donations) to maintain their operations and changes in these sources of revenue may influence the reliability or predictability with which the organization can hire and retain staff, sustain facilities, create programs, or maintain tax-exempt status. For example, a university that sells research to for-profit companies may have tax exemption problems. In addition, unreliable funding, long hours and low pay can result in employee retention problems. During 2009, the US government acknowledged this critical need by the inclusion of the Nonprofit Capacity Building Program in the Serve America Act. Further efforts to quantify the scope of the sector and propose policy solutions for community benefit were included in the Nonprofit Sector and Community Solutions Act, proposed during 2010.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the instrument for which Saint-Saëns's pupil left no legacy of works? from the following article ?  Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, \\"this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark\\". Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique. Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed \\"the French Beethoven\\", and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas. He is not known even to have contemplated writing one. There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces. In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as \\"Souvenir d'Italie\\" (1887), \\"Les cloches du soir\\" (\\"Evening bells\\", 1889) and \\"Souvenir d'Ismaïlia\\" (1895). Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo. Some of them were written for use in church services – \\"Offertoire\\" (1853), \\"Bénédiction nuptiale\\" (1859), \\"Communion\\" (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former. Answer:","output":"The instrument for which Saint-Saëns's pupil left no legacy of works is the organ. The pupil mentioned in the article is Gabriel Fauré, a renowned composer and pianist close to Saint-Saëns. Though Fauré had a long career as a reluctant organist, he did not leave any significant composition for the instrument unlike Saint-Saëns, who authored several pieces for both church services and concert use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He studied with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger in Paris, and was best known for his 1928 choral symphony, John Brown's Song, based on Stephen Benet's Pulitzer Prize winning poem \\"John Brown's Body\\". Can we draw the following conclusion? Robert Delaney spent time in Paris studying with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Robert Delaney spent time in Paris studying with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. This conclusion is based on the information provided, which states that Delaney was an American composer who studied with both Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger, two renowned musicians and composers, in the city of Paris.  It could be further deduced that Delaney's time in Paris might have played a significant role in shaping his musical career and understanding of composition. Studying under the guidance of Boulanger and Honegger, both highly respected figures in the world of classical music, would have provided Delaney with invaluable knowledge, skills, and insights into the world of composition. Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979) was a prominent French composer, conductor, and music educator, who taught some of the most influential composers and musicians of the 20th century. Her method of teaching emphasized a deep understanding of music theory, harmony, and counterpoint, as well as a strong sense of discipline and professionalism. Among her many accomplishments, Boulanger was the first woman to conduct major concerts with the likes of the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Arthur Honegger (1892-1955) was a Swiss composer, who was also a part of the famous Les Six, a group of influential early 20th-century composers that included Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, and Georges Auric. Honegger's music primarily encompassed the symphonic genre, and he was particularly known for his oratorio \\"King David,\\" as well as his five symphonies and numerous film scores.

I heard that Kendall got milk for all their friends so they could have it with their snacks.  And I was wondering What will Kendall want to do next? OPT: (1). Ask for napkin. (2). enjoy the milk. (3). Ask for wipe. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that Kendall enjoys being a thoughtful and considerate friend. After getting milk for all their friends to enjoy with their snacks, Kendall may likely consider their next move in terms of enhancing the overall experience and ensuring that everyone is comfortable while enjoying the treats. Taking into account the three options provided, Kendall might be inclined to choose option 1, which is to ask for napkins. This choice demonstrates Kendall's continued thoughtfulness and attentiveness to their friends' needs. Providing napkins will help everyone maintain a clean and pleasant eating environment, as they can use the napkins to wipe their hands or clean up any spills that may occur while having the milk and snacks. Option 2 suggests Kendall should enjoy the milk, which is a valid choice. However, since Kendall emphasizes making sure their friends are happy, they would likely have already poured themselves a glass of milk at the same time as their friends. Therefore, enjoying the milk would naturally occur along with ensuring everyone else's satisfaction. Option 3 involves asking for wipes, which, similar to napkins, may serve a purpose in maintaining cleanliness. However, wipes are often considered more for cleaning surfaces and are not typically associated with usage during meals. Additionally, wipes may not be as versatile as napkins, as napkins can serve multiple purposes, such as absorbing spilled liquid and providing a surface to place snacks on. In conclusion, Kendall would most likely want to ask for napkins next, as it showcases their continued thoughtfulness and caters to their friends' comfort while enjoying the milk and snacks. This choice effectively enhances the overall positive experience Kendall has already provided by ensuring everyone has milk to accompany their snacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prepare the cage for the baby hamsters' birth by first creating a clean and comfortable environment for the mother and her pups. A well-ventilated cage with ample space is crucial to ensure the comfort of the mother hamster and her offspring. Make sure you provide enough bedding material, such as unscented paper or wood shavings, to create a cozy nest for the babies. It's essential to monitor the mother hamster's behavior during pregnancy and after giving birth. Make sure she has access to ample food, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and hamster-specific pellets, to ensure her nutritional needs are met. Providing a constant supply of clean, fresh water will also help the mother stay adequately hydrated. Once the baby hamsters are born, minimize handling and disturbance to reduce stress on both the mother and her pups. Observing them from a distance will give the mother adequate time to bond with and care for her babies. As the pups grow, they will start to explore their surroundings and eventually require weaning off of the mother's milk. At around three to four weeks of age, you can start offering the baby hamsters solid food, such as hamster pellets and occasional treats like small pieces of fruits or vegetables. As they continue to grow and mature into juveniles, it's essential to monitor their development and overall health. This includes keeping an eye on their weight and watching for potential signs of illness. If any issues arise, consult with your vet promptly. Finding a responsible home for the pups once they reach an appropriate age is also a vital part of the process. Reach out to friends, family, and local pet groups to find potential adopters who understand the responsibility of hamster care. If you're unable to find suitable homes within your network, consider contacting a reputable rescue organization or pet adoption agency to help with placement. By staying informed about your hamsters' needs and working closely with your vet throughout the process, you ultimately ensure the wellbeing of both the mother and her litter. This will provide the best chances for the baby hamsters to thrive and grow into happy, healthy pets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: This startup's outlets can make your smart home even smarter As I walk into my master bedroom, a bedside table lamp turns on. Five minutes after I exit it turns off. The same thing happens downstairs when I enter the guest room of my home to put away sheets. It feels very much like I live in the future. When it works. I’m testing a 160 package of three outlets from a startup called Zuli. The outlets allow me to plug in any device and turn it on and off remotely, set schedules, gather energy consumption, and, if the device is a lamp, I can dim it. But the real magic comes into play when you have three of these outlets plugged into your home, because then they can track where you are and offer presence awareness. Presence is big. To get to a truly smart home, devices need more context, and knowing where people are in the home is a crucial piece of context. For example, one of the most popular Internet connected devices in the home is probably the Nest thermostat. It can sense when you are home or away based on a proximity sensor in the thermostat. But because thermostats are usually located in out-of-the-way locations, a lot of people find themselves working away in an isolated corner of the house only to realize their thermostat has switched to away mode because they haven’t walked in front of the thermostat in a while. Another popular application for better presence is turning on lights. Motion detectors work, but if someone is still, the lights can turn off. With presence based on Zuli’s outlets, that use Bluetooth communicating with your phone, the lights won’t turn off unless your phone exits the room. There are dozens of use cases for finely tuned presence detection in the home, especially if the devices offering that precise detection are open to sharing that information with other connected products and services through an application programming interface (API). Zuli isn’t there yet. But neither is any other company with products on the market at the moment. First off, Zuli’s outlets work with Bluetooth, and today you need your phone (specifically an iPhone) to communicate with the outlets. This means the presence detection only works when your phone is in your pocket and for people who have their phone (running the Zuli app) on them. I found in living with the outlets for a week that the experience was a bit uneven. Sometimes my light turned on as I walked into the room, but other times it would turn on about 10 feet away from the door. In a worst case scenario I’d have to walk about six feet into the room before the light would turn on. I also noticed that when I set the light to turn off after I left, if I didn’t go into a room with another Zuli outlet in it, the system wouldn’t always register that I had left the room and left the light on. When I had my phone and everything worked, it was like magic. It was exactly how I wanted my home to perform and it avoided a lot of the rules and programming issues that come with the motion sensors I’ve tried previously. However, it drained my battery quite a bit, and I was also frustrated because I wanted to use the presence information from the outlets to trigger other smart home devices, like my light switches. I don’t have that many lamps to trigger in my home. Zuli co-founder and CEO Taylor Umphreys says the company is considering how it might create a way to share presence information, and it currently has an integration with the Nest thermostat so the outlets can act as a presence sensor to help keep your Nest from going into Away mode when you are at home. I’d like to see something a little more open-ended like an If This Then That channel, but that’s not in the plans right now, according to Umphreys. However, even with the flaws I think if you’re in the market for a stand-alone smart home product (or one that works with Nest) and are interested in connected outlets, these compare well with existing options on the market. They have more features for the price than the Belkin Wemo Insight outlets, which also offers energy monitoring but lacks the lamp dimming capability and presence features. Once you start playing with presence you start seeing how compelling a smart home will be. And how truly far off we are from one.

He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan 25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses.  - Major Clifford Hugh \\"C. H.\\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879  29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.  - Rachel Anne Notley (born April 17, 1964) is a Canadian politician and the 17th and current Premier of Alberta, since 2015. She is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Edmonton-Strathcona, and leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party. The daughter of former Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley, Notley's career before politics focused on labour law, with a specialty in workers' compensation advocacy and workplace health and safety issues.  - Social credit is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by C. H. Douglas (18791952), a British engineer, who published a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses economics, political science, history, and accounting. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\"  - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values. The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when Réal Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement créditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies.  - The Bow River is a river in the Canadian province of Alberta. It begins in the Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River. These waters ultimately flow through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. The Bow River runs through the city of Calgary, taking in the Elbow River at the historic site of Fort Calgary near downtown. The Bow River pathway, developed along the river's banks, is considered a part of Calgary's self-image.  - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about .

Please answer the following question: This article: Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian... contains an answer for the question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis?, what is it ?

In practical terms, each one of the three interactionist constructions implies a corresponding position on the school and the human condition in society, as follows. Say this using Spanish.","output":"En términos prácticos, cada una de las tres construcciones interaccionistas implica una posición correspondiente en la escuela y la condición humana en la sociedad, de la siguiente manera: 1. Construcción simbólica interaccionista: Esta teoría sostiene que las personas se relacionan e interactúan entre sí, creando y compartiendo significados a través de los símbolos y las comunicaciones. En un contexto escolar, esta perspectiva enfatiza que los estudiantes construyen su conocimiento a través de la participación activa y la interacción con sus compañeros y profesores. Esto sugiere que la educación debe centrarse en proporcionar un entorno en el que los estudiantes puedan interactuar, explorar y debatir, y en el que se valoren y respeten sus ideas y contribuciones. Desde esta perspectiva, la condición humana en la sociedad es moldeada por las interacciones sociales y comunicativas, siendo fundamental el papel de la educación en el desarrollo de habilidades sociales y de comunicación. 2. Construcción estructuralista interaccionista: Esta perspectiva enfatiza la influencia de las estructuras sociales y las instituciones en la interacción humana. En el ámbito escolar, esto implica que la educación debe ser entendida como una institución que no solo se encarga de la transmisión de conocimientos, sino que también cumple un papel esencial en la socialización y en la internalización de las normas y valores compartidos por la sociedad. La condición humana en la sociedad, según este enfoque, está determinada en gran medida por las estructuras sociales y las relaciones de poder que existen dentro de estas, y las escuelas juegan un papel crucial en la reproducción y legitimación de estas estructuras. 3. Construcción interaccionista dialéctica: Esta teoría contempla la interacción humana como un proceso dialéctico, en el que las personas se influyen mutuamente a través de interacciones conflictivas y cooperativas. En el contexto escolar, esto sugiere que la educación debe fomentar el diálogo, la reflexión crítica y el pensamiento creativo, y reconocer que el conocimiento y la educación son producto de la interacción entre individuos con diferentes perspectivas y puntos de vista. Desde esta perspectiva, la condición humana en la sociedad es una combinación de interacciones dialécticas y contradictorias, y la educación tiene el potencial de promover cambios y transformaciones en la sociedad, al capacitar a los individuos para comprender y cuestionar las estructuras existentes y para explorar y crear nuevas posibilidades. En resumen, estas tres construcciones interaccionistas ofrecen diferentes visiones sobre el papel y la importancia de la escuela en la sociedad, enfocándose en aspectos como la construcción de significado, la influencia de las estructuras sociales y la promoción del pensamiento dialéctico y crítico."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Moammar Gadhafi's military machine pounded the western city of Misrata again Tuesday as France and Britain called for beefed-up NATO airstrikes to stop such attacks on the Libyan people. Witnesses reported heavy shelling in central Misrata, besieged for weeks and the scene of some of the worst fighting in the Libyan conflict. At least 10 people were killed and 30 others wounded in the heavy shelling, a doctor operating in two central clinics told CNN. The doctor, identified only as Dr. Hakim for safety reasons, said medical teams are exhausted from treating the wounded. Rebel fighter Moaath al-Misrati told CNN the shelling came after rebels killed several of Gadhafi's snipers. \\"We are expecting a ground offensive by the Gadhafi forces any time now,\\" he said. The witnesses said all telephone communications, including mobile service, had been cut. British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive in Libya, and a rebel leader issued a plea for the international community to carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution of March 17, which calls for \\"all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack\\" in the North African country. Hague told reporters in Brussels, Belgium, that \\"a huge amount has been achieved in Libya, but clearly there is more to be done.\\" Juppe said NATO needs to fully embrace the role it accepted -- to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's forces. \\"NATO wanted to take charge of the military operations, we accepted it,\\" Juppe said on France Info radio. \\"It has to carry out its role today, which means to prevent Gadhafi from using heavy weapons to bombard the population.\\" Specifically, Juppe mentioned the attacks on Misrata, where on Monday at least five civilians -- including two toddlers, a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people wounded in mortar attacks, according to witnesses. In Benghazi, Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, the deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council, issued an \\"urgent statement\\" calling on the international community \\"to intervene and stop the massacres that Gadhafi promised in Misrata, and to implement the UN resolution in any possible means.\\" Ghoga told CNN that the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France. He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders and he didn't know exactly what was being requested. Last week, when asked by CNN's Reza Sayah which countries were providing rebels with weapons and training, Ghoga said, \\"We are in communication with our brothers in Qatar and also with our brothers in the Egyptian republic and with our friends in Italy and France.\\" He indicated in the interview that the weapons were on their way to Libya. Meanwhile, Libya's most high-profile defector flew from Britain to Qatar Tuesday for talks on how to break the deadly impasse in his nation. Former Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa flew to the Qatari capital, Doha, to meet with government officials and Libyan opposition leaders ahead of the first meeting Wednesday of the Libya Contact Group, formed in London last month and charged with implementing United Nations resolutions.

In a news conference in Benghazi, Ghoga did not explicity reject the idea of opposition leaders' meeting with Koussa in Doha, but said such a meeting was \\"not on the agenda.\\" In an earlier interview with the BBC, Koussa had expressed concern that the situation in Libya was spiraling downward into a grinding war, in the mold of the conflict in Somalia. Koussa, who fled Libya last month and sought safe haven in Britain after resigning his post in Gadhafi's regime, urged all parties to avoid plunging Libya into a civil war. \\"This will lead to (much bloodshed), and Libya will be a new Somalia,\\" Koussa told the BBC.

He told reporters a meeting with Moussa Koussa in Doha \\"was not on the agenda.\\" An African Union attempt at forging peace fell flat when Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people. Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace, his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement after a meeting in Tripoli. The African Union plan announced Monday did not address whether Gadhafi will step down, nor is it binding. According to the memorandum detailed by Ramtane Lamara, the African Union's commissioner for peace and security, the plan had four elements:. -- An immediate end to all fighting. -- Libyan authorities' cooperation \\"to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance\\" -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya. -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities, including opposition figures, with the aim of setting up \\"an inclusive transition period\\" to adopt and implement \\"political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still \\"waiting to get a full readout\\" from participants in the African Union's peace mission in Libya. \\"We've made it very clear that we want to see a cease-fire,\\" Clinton said. But she said there also must be, among other things, a resumption of water, electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been \\"brutalized by Gadhafi's forces.\\" She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power. Ghoga, the Transitional National Council's deputy chairman, on Tuesday said rebel forces were \\"fighting in the direction of Brega\\" from the western gate of the \\"completely liberated\\" city of Ajdabiya. \\"Gadhafi's forces still have some elements in Brega,\\" he told reporters. \\"We added more security personnel to protect the oil fields in the city because the regime is trying to strand us economically.\\" \\"The situation in Tripoli is very dire,\\" Ghoga continued. He said fuel and food there were depleted \\"because all fuel is being for the Gadhafi forces' need(s).\\" Ghoga also claimed that \\"thousands of demonstrators\\" opposing the regime were arrested in the capital and that \\"a large number of them were executed in the Saladin military academy,\\" but didn't provide further details. CNN could not independently confirm those claims. He added that on Monday, \\"there was a massive demonstration in Fashloum in Tripoli, and the majority were hiding their faces, fearing arrest.\\" CNN's Amir Ahmed, Reza Sayah and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In response to Moammar Gadhafi's military machine attacking the western city of Misrata in 2011, France and Britain called for increased NATO airstrikes to protect Libyan civilians. Witnesses reported heavy shelling of the besieged city, resulting in at least 10 deaths and 30 injuries. A doctor, known as Dr. Hakim for safety purposes, claimed medical teams were exhausted from treating the wounded. British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe urged NATO to be more aggressive in Libya, calling for the protection of civilians under threat of attack. Juppe stressed that NATO had to prevent Gadhafi from using heavy weapons against the population. In Benghazi, Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, the deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council, issued an urgent plea for the international community to stop the massacres in Misrata and follow the U.N. Security Council resolution. The rebels submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France, while the former Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa traveled to Doha for talks on finding a resolution to the situation in Libya. The African Union attempted to forge peace, but the rebel leaders rejected their proposal as it did not address the ongoing violence against the Libyan people. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized that a ceasefire was necessary, along with a resumption of water, electricity, and other services to cities brutalized by Gadhafi's forces.

Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce. The cities they live in have very similar environments with the only difference being that the CO2 levels in Jerry's town are elevated, and in Gary's they are not. Jerry and Gary regularly talk on the phone and compare notes with each other since their farms are so similar.  Hint: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants.

Tequila tours: Mexico's spirit draws drinkers south It's said the national drink of Mexico has magical properties: It closes contracts and opens doors, makes shy people bold and helps form friendships. A jimador, who uses a flat-bladed knife called a \\"coa\\" to remove the spiny leaves from the center pina of an agave, demonstrates on a tour at Herradura Tequila in Tequila, Mexico. A jimador, who uses a flat-bladed knife called a \\"coa\\" to remove the spiny leaves from the center pina of an agave, demonstrates on a tour at Herradura Tequila in Tequila, Mexico. To the uninitiated, the wrong tequila consumed incorrectly also opens medicine chests. The first thing one learns on a tour of the heart of Mexico's tequila country is that no one here drinks tequila as a shooter - it's better sipped from a brandy snifter or champagne glass so that the full sweet and buttery flavors and aromas of the agave can come through. And the aficionado would never drink anything other than a tequila made from 100 percent agave. Anything less, like the popular Jose Cuervo Gold, is a \\"mixto\\" that by law only has to contain 51 percent of alcohol distilled from agave. The rest could be any other sugary plant like the beet, which makes it potentially hangover-inducing. Tequila consumption has increased 45 percent in the U.S. over the past five years. It's no wonder, then, that the country is waking up to the tourism power of tequila, the drink, and Tequila, the place - the center of the farming region of the prickly Weber blue agave plants from which the spirit is distilled. \\"Tequila is like wine, and those of us who get into it know our favorite tequilas in the same way that a wine lover would know why they like certain wines,\\" said Rachel Nicholls-Bernyk, who travels here from Fresno, Calif., at least once a year. \\"I enjoy learning something new about the language and the culture and the people, and of course, making tequila.\\" The affair margarita-loving Americans are having with premium tequila has fueled a tourist boom here in the mountainous state of Jalisco, where tequila was born centuries ago in the town that shares its name. In this once-sleepy village hotels are being remodeled, new bed and breakfasts are opening, and the main drag is getting a cobblestone makeover. In April a slick new OXXO, Mexico's version of 7-11, became the first chain store to open in downtown, a concession to the growing number of tequila-loving tourists who lack the adventure or language skills to navigate the quaint marketplaces and lively street-food stands that thrive in the shadow of the historic stone cathedral in the city center. The town expects an even bigger tourist influx in October, when the Pan American Games will be held in nearby Guadalajara. GETTING THERE: The village of Tequila is less than 50 miles from Guadalajara. Many major U.S. airports have direct flights to Guadalajara.TEQUILA EXPRESS PARTY TRAIN: Train from Guadalajara to Casa Herradura in Amatitan.EXPERIENCE TEQUILA: Five-day group tours, 1,400 a person double occupancy (10-day tours and private one-day tours also available.) 503-841-1739.TEQUILA DISTILLERY TOURS: More information can be found here.NATIONAL MUSEUM OF TEQUILA: Open Tuesday-Sunday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.HOTELS IN TEQUILA: Accommodations include the charming Hotel Casa Dulce Maria, 011-52-374-742-3200, from 50, and the town’s first luxury boutique hotel, Los Abolengos, starting at 120. The popularity of premium tequilas means increasingly varied travel options. Almost all tequilas are from in and around the state of Jalisco. Tequilas from the less touristy \\"highlands\\" near the towns of Arandas and Atontonilco about 65 miles east of Guadalajara are generally light and sweet. El Tesoro, Don Julio, Don Pilar and the highly regarded 7 Leguas are among those from the region, as well as market leader Patron. Of these, only 7 Leguas and Don Pilar have tours by appointment; the others cater to industry insiders. However, travel to these slightly more out-of-the-way spots is now considered somewhat risky without a guide because of violence from drug traffickers. Even some of the distillery owners stay away. But here in tequila's primary namesake destination, the safe Valle de Tequila, everyone from the tequila snob to college students can find their place. A favorite stop for both crowds is Don Javier's cantina La Capilla, home of his 50-year-old invention, the Batanga, a mixture of Coke, tequila, lime juice and salt. Now well into his 90s, Don Javier still spends time behind the bar. The town sits in the shadow of the 9,500-foot Volcan de Tequila, an ancient volcano that gave the region its lava-rich soil. While there are hundreds of varieties of the agave lily that can be distilled, to be called tequila it must come from the Weber blue agave. The spiny plants grow for between six and 12 years in neat rows on hillsides, the valley floor, and even in medians along the highways. Tours of the biggest distilleries such as Sauza and Cuervo are easy to find. Mundo Cuervo is the Disney of distilleries, and its swank cantinas, restaurants and gift shops occupy a huge swath of the town. A self-guided walking tour through town is part of the Ruta de Tequila, a trail that links Jalisco's tequila-producing cities that was patterned after Napa's wine trail. Also appealing to some is the Tequila Express party train that on weekends ferries tourists from Guadalajara 40 miles to Casa Herradura in neighboring Amatitan, where visitors can sip tequila from a barrel carried by a donkey or see a man dressed in the traditional white garb of the field workers (jimadores) cut the spines off the agave, leaving only the pineapple-looking center for baking. The smaller operations often produce the most interesting spirits, often offering historical glimpses of the manufacturing process that the big labels long ago abandoned. Tequila explorers can see and taste agave that has baked in modern autoclaves for eight hours (the equivalent of a pressure cooker) and compare the flavors to those at a distillery that still bakes for days inside stone ovens. Competition has inspired many distilleries to alter old techniques. At Casa Noble, the country's first California Certified Organic Farming operation, new French oak aging barrels have replaced used American bourbon barrels, which gives the final product notes of vanilla. Don Pilar uses champagne yeast to enhance fermentation and, distillers hope, impart a unique flavor; but like the best boutique winemakers, El Tesoro still allows native yeasts present in the open-air fermentation room to dictate how each vintage tastes. Workers at Destileria la Fortaleza, the last distillery in Tequila, Mexico, that still uses a giant lava stone to crush the juices from the baked agave. At Destileria La Fortaleza, visitors will find the last tequilero that still painstakingly presses 100 percent of its sugary juice from the agave using a giant lava stone, called a \\"tahona,\\" instead of modern shredding machines. The historic hacienda was home of industry giant Sauza, which the family sold in the 1970s. In the 1990s, Guillermo Erickson Sauza, who represents the fifth generation, revived the old operation using original equipment on land his family still held. Tours are available through the Sauza museum on the main plaza. Any tourist who looks lost in Tequila's main plaza will be approached by a guide selling tickets on one of the many wacky tourist buses shaped like barrels and bottles. The luckiest tourists arrive with Clayton Szczech of Experience Tequila. He's a Portland resident who loves the culture and history so much that he now guides tequila-curious tourists. The Lonely Planet-recommended guide is the first gringo to hold the TT certification of the country's Tequila Regulatory Council, which means he is as adept at discerning flavors as he is at explaining how it all came to be. He took us to an obscure, one-man operation where the tequilero used a garden hose to fill our liter Coke bottle from his lone aging barrel. And he's friendly with premium distillers such as Casa Noble, which don't usually open their doors for tours. \\"True tequila and a tequila culture thrive down here, you've just got to know where to look,\\" said Szczech.

Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. When carbon dioxide levels in the blood increase, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen decreases, known as the Bohr effect. This indirect impact on the oxygen-hemoglobin binding means that less oxygen will be carried by the hemoglobin, thus reducing the amount of oxygen being delivered to the body's tissues. To summarize, the supposed perturbation of less carbon dioxide removal does not directly impact any step of the process mentioned, but rather has an indirect effect on oxygen transport to the body due to the changes in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen in response to the increase in blood carbon dioxide levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring.

By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 00:06 EST, 19 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:57 EST, 19 July 2013. WNBA star Brittney Griner has opened up more than ever about the intense bullying she suffered at school, revealing it was so bad at times she thought 'I don't even want to be alive.' Griner, who on Wednesday night was named 'Best Female College Athlete' for her 2012-13 season at Baylor at the ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, said she was still haunted by the memories of her peers refusing to believe she was a girl, questioning her sexual orientation and even groping her physically. 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 with a wingspan of 88 inches. She publicly came out as a lesbian in April, ahead of the WNBA draft. Winner: WNBA player Brittney Griner, pictured, attends The 2013 ESPY Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A. where she won an award. In an honest interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Phoenix Mercury powerhouse described one day in seventh grade when class had just let out and the hallway was flooded with students. As Griner made her way through the crowd, a male student stopped her. 'You're a dude,' he said. 'I just stood there and took it. I was humiliated. The whole school was laughing at me,' Griner recalled to The Times. 'When I was younger, it really bothered. me to the point where I was like \\"I don't even want to be alive; why am I. getting treated like that?\\"' Griner said. 'But as I got older, I. started caring less.' She said she told her mother she liked girls after her first day of high school. 'I felt a release, I felt better,' Griner said. 'She was so cool about it. She was like \\"I kinda already know, and I love you.\\"' Her father, a former Marine, didn't take it so well and tension between the two saw Griner move out in her senior year. Despite her tumultuous home life, on court she shone, leading her team from Houston's Nimitz High to the Texas Division 5A girls' basketball state championship game and becoming America's most sought after recruit. Bullying: The Phoenix Mercury star, pictured in June, has opened up more than ever about the intense bullying she suffered in school, with some peers even calling her 'a dude' Tall: 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches. But she was still subject to nasty taunts from opposing sides, which left her regularly crying alone in her room after games, she told The Times. She went off to college at Baylor with a resolution to block out the negativity and not let bullying affect her. And by the end of sophomore year she succeeded. But she said she chose to publicly come out in April, regardless of the fallout, to give young girls experiencing the same nightmare someone to look up to. 'I didn't have a real role model that I could look up to that was out openly,' she told The Times. 'I knew there were a lot of younger girls that needed someone.' In May, Griner revealed how her former coach at Baylor told players to keep details of their sexuality under wraps for fear of damaging recruitment possibilities. The top pick of the WNBA draft recalled being told by Kim Mulkey that talking openly about her homosexuality could damage the reputation of the basketball program. Though Griner said she never hid the fact that she was gay from friends and family, she found at Baylor there was 'an unwritten law' that players shouldn't discuss their sexual preferences. Secret's out: Former Baylor women's basketball star Brittney Griner says that head coach, Kim Mulkey, told players not to be open publicly about their sexuality. Speaking to ESPN in May, she recalled: '... it was just kind of, like, one of those things, you know, just don't do. it. They kind of tried to make it, like, 'Why put your business out on. the street like that?'\\" The 6-foot-8 basketball champion. acknowledged that she is gay in the media in April and talked about. being bullied while growing up. 'It was hard. Just being picked on for. being different. Just being bigger, my sexuality, everything,' Griner told Sports Illustrated. 'I overcame it and got over it. Definitely something that I am. very passionate about. In the ESPN interview she explained that when Kim Mulkey recruited her, she was honest about who she was. Still friends: Griner explained in an interview that Kim Mulkey (right) and staff at Baylor thought being open about sexual preferences could potentially damage the programme's recruitment success and reputation. History: Griner (pictured hugging Mulkey) will start with the Phoenix Mercury this season. 'I told Coach [Mulkey] when she was. recruiting me. I was like, \\"I'm gay. I hope that's not a problem,\\" and. she told me that it wasn't,' Griner said. 'I mean, my teammates knew,. obviously they all knew. Everybody knew about it.' But when one of Griner's tweets to an. ex-girlfriend was noticed by an staffer at Baylor, she was told to take. the post down by 'someone in the office.' 'It was a recruiting thing,' Griner. added. 'The coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it,. people wouldn't let their kids come play for Baylor.' Baylor University is a rigidly. Baptist university in Texas that discourages students from participating. in 'advocacy groups which promote understandings of sexuality that are. contrary to biblical teaching.' Star: Griner dominated NCAA and was number one in last month's WNBA draft. Mulkey did not comment directly in. response to Griner's remarks but said in a statement earlier in May:. 'Brittney Griner represented Baylor University proudly on and off the. basketball court, and she leaves behind an incredible legacy. 'I cannot comment on personal matters. surrounding any of our student-athletes, but I can tell you Brittney. will always be a celebrated member of the Baylor family.' In an interview in April, when asked about why more female athletes were out as opposed to men, Griner replied: 'I really couldn't give an answer on why that's so different. Being one that's out, it's just being who you are.' 'Don't worry about what other people are going to say because they're. always going to say something. 'But if you're just true to yourself, let. that shine through. Don't hide who you really are,' she continued. Top: Brittney Griner, left, shakes hands with WNBA President Laurel J. Richie after the Phoenix Mercury selected Griner as the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft on Monday. The star then told Sports Illustrated that she doesn't think her fame made it harder to come out. 'It really wasn't too difficult. I wouldn't say I was hiding or. anything like that,' Griner said. 'I've always been open about who I am. and my sexuality, so it wasn't hard at all. 'If I can show that I'm out. and I'm fine and everything's OK, then hopefully the younger generation. will definitely feel the same way.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article discusses the intense bullying that WNBA star Brittney Griner faced during her school years due to her height, deep voice, and sexual orientation. Griner, who stands 6 feet 8 inches tall with an 88-inch wingspan, publicly came out as a lesbian in April, before the WNBA draft. She reveals that the bullying was so severe at times that she contemplated suicide. Despite this, Griner found support in her mother and went on to excel in basketball, leading her high school team to the Texas Division 5A girls' basketball state championship game. She has since used her public platform to give a voice to young girls and openly discuss her sexual orientation. Griner also recalled how her former coach at Baylor, Kim Mulkey, advised players to keep their sexual preferences a secret for fear of damaging the school's basketball program. While Griner didn't hide the fact that she was gay from friends and family, it was an \\"unwritten law\\" at Baylor that players should not discuss their sexual orientation. Griner hopes that by being open about her experiences and standing up against bullying, she can inspire others to do the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If the buyer or seller asks for any information that you don’t feel comfortable giving out, avoid working with them.  If you ever feel uncomfortable by what information a buyer or seller asks from you, avoid working with them. Never put your information in a private message to a buyer or seller on sites like Etsy, Craigslist, Facebook, or eBay. Credit cards usually have zero-liability policies, which means you won’t have to pay for transactions that you didn’t authorize if someone steals your information. Since debit cards don’t have the same liability protection, delete any debit information you have saved on the marketplace and replace them with the credit card you use.  Sign up for fraud alerts through your credit card company so you can get notified if any charges don’t seem correct. Pay off the credit card as soon as you make a purchase so you aren’t charged additional interest. You may also use PayPal to make purchases on sites like eBay or Etsy. If you’re buying, only bring the amount you agreed upon paying so the other person doesn’t try to drive up the price.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.  Question: \\"What are some reasons for uses of the Albanian language?\\" Response: \\"Catholic\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The question asks for the reasons for the uses of the Albanian language, while the response simply provides \\"Catholic\\" as an answer, which is a religious context mentioned in the passage, but does not fully address the reasons for using the language. A more appropriate long and detailed answer would be: There are several reasons for the uses of the Albanian language. Firstly, the Albanian language holds historical and cultural significance, being an Indo-European language which has its own distinct branch within the language family. The language's origins possibly trace back to Illyrian or Daco-Thracian languages, which highlights its ancient and rich heritage. Secondly, the Albanian language has played a crucial role in the cultural renaissance of the region. The development and promotion of the language in religious texts and publications have helped preserve and enrich the local literary tradition. This was evident in the efforts of Catholic clerics in the North, and of the Orthodox Church in the South. The translation of the Catholic liturgy into Albanian by Gjon Buzuku, for instance, aimed to do for Albanian what Martin Luther did for the German language, bringing religious texts closer to the people and making them more accessible. Lastly, the Albanian language serves as a means of communication and identity for Albanian-speaking communities. As a unique language, it helps to maintain the distinctiveness of its speakers by preserving their cultural and historical roots, as well as fostering a sense of national pride and unity. The language continues to be an essential element in defining and expressing the social and cultural identity of the Albanian people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: What does it mean when a man says he is attracted to you? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. 1). no. 2). yes.","output":"To answer these questions, let's analyze them step-by-step: First question: What does it mean when a man says you're sexy? Step 1: Understand the term \\"sexy\\" - Sexy is an adjective used to describe someone who is sexually attractive or has characteristics that elicit sexual desire in someone else. Step 2: Interpret the meaning in the context of the man's statement - When a man says you're sexy, it typically means he finds you sexually attractive or sexually appealing. Second question: What does it mean when a man says he is attracted to you? Step 1: Understand the term \\"attracted\\" - Attracted, in this context, refers to feeling drawn, emotionally or physically, toward someone due to their qualities, characteristics, or appearance. Step 2: Interpret the meaning in the context of the man's statement - When a man says he is attracted to you, he is expressing that he feels a sense of attraction toward you, which can encompass an emotional, mental, or physical connection. Now, let's evaluate whether these two questions are asking the same thing: Comparing the interpretations from the analyses above, we can notice that the first question is specifically about sexual attractiveness, while the second question is about attraction in general, which can be emotional, mental, or physical in addition to sexual. So, the answer is: 1). no. These two questions are not asking the same thing because being sexy is more focused on sexual attractiveness, whereas being attracted to someone can encompass emotional, mental, or physical attraction in addition to sexual attraction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The book 'The one that got away' is a book about which WWII pilot?","output":"\\"The One That Got Away\\" is a book about the World War II pilot Franz von Werra. The book, written by British author Kendal Burt and first published in 1956, provides a detailed account of the life and wartime experiences of the German Luftwaffe pilot. Franz von Werra, born in July 1914, was an ace fighter pilot who gained notoriety for being the only Axis prisoner of war to escape and make a successful return to Germany during World War II. Franz von Werra's story is an intriguing mix of bravery, resourcefulness, and determination. He initially served with the German Luftwaffe in the early part of the war, flying primarily the Messerschmitt Bf 109 - a famed German single-engine fighter. He experienced several air battles during the Battle of Britain, ultimately leading to his capture by the British forces after being shot down on September 5, 1940. Von Werra was taken as a prisoner by the British and transported to several prisoner-of-war camps in the United Kingdom and Canada. During his time in captivity, he made numerous attempts to escape. His most famous escape attempt, from which the book's title is derived, took place in January 1941 while being held as a prisoner in Canada. He managed to slip away from his captors in the dead of winter and, using a combination of survival skills, forged documents, and sheer determination, made his way south towards the United States. At the time, the United States had not yet entered the war, so von Werra believed it would offer an opportunity for asylum and eventual repatriation to Germany. Upon reaching the United States, he was arrested by American authorities but was ultimately released due to diplomatic pressure from Germany. Once released, von Werra made his way through several neutral countries before, finally, reaching the German-occupied territory in April 1941- thus becoming the only Axis prisoner of war to escape from Allied captivity and successfully return to his homeland during World War II. Franz von Werra died in October 1941 when his Bf 109 crashed over the North Sea during a non-operational flight. The book \\"The One That Got Away\\" masterfully recounts his incredible and powerful story, which was later adapted into a British film in 1957, directed by Roy Ward Baker and starring Hardy Krüger as von Werra. In summary, the book \\"The One That Got Away\\" is about the German World War II pilot Franz von Werra, who gained notoriety for being the only Axis prisoner to escape from Allied captivity and successfully return to Germany. The narrative delves deeply into his life, military service, daring escape attempts, and eventual return to the German Luftwaffe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level.  Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we need to consider the factors contributing to the occurrence of thunderstorms in both locations. Step 1: Identifying factors affecting thunderstorm frequency - Altitude: Thunderstorms are more likely to occur at lower altitudes due to the higher concentration of water vapor available for condensation. - Temperature: Warmer temperatures increase evaporation, which leads to more cloud formation and a higher chance of thunderstorms. - Topography: Mountains tend to have more irregular atmospheric conditions, which could either increase or decrease thunderstorm activity depending on the specific circumstances. - Proximity to large water bodies: Coastal areas are often more prone to thunderstorms due to the influence of larger water bodies, such as oceans, in driving convection and providing moisture for storm development. Step 2: Comparing Dee and Ann's locations based on the identified factors - Altitude: Ann's mountain village is at 8000 ft, while Dee's coastal town is at sea level. Ann has a higher altitude, which would generally lead to fewer thunderstorms. - Temperature: Without specific information about the two places' temperatures, we assume that the coastal town may have more moderate temperatures, while the mountain village has cooler temperatures. Warmer temperatures would make the coastal town more prone to thunderstorms. - Topography: Ann's mountain village may experience irregular atmospheric conditions due to being in the mountains, leading to either more or fewer thunderstorms. Dee's coastal town has an unclear effect on thunderstorms in this aspect. - Proximity to large water bodies: Dee's coastal town is close to a large water body, which makes it more prone to thunderstorms. Step 3: Drawing a conclusion based on the comparison Based on the factors we've considered, Ann's mountain village is at a higher altitude and has cooler temperatures, both of which indicate that it experiences fewer thunderstorms than Dee's coastal town. While topography is uncertain in its effects, Dee's coastal location may further increase the likelihood of thunderstorms due to the influence of a large water body. Answer: Ann, who lives in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, likely experiences fewer thunderstorms than Dee, who lives in a coastal town at sea level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  Now, I have a new situation: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.  Answer this question please: Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots? A:","output":"The fruit that contains more crystallized sugar between plums and apricots would be plums. This is simply because Ann decided to candy the plums, as stated in the scenario you provided. Candying is a form of the sugaring preservation method where the fruit is dehydrated and then packed with pure sugar. Therefore, the plums would have been infused with additional sugar, resulting in a high crystallized sugar content. On the other hand, Ann didn't candy the apricots; she kept them fresh. This means the sugar content in the apricots would only consist of their natural sugars, making them contain less sugar than the candied plums. Please note that when comparing the inherent sugar content of plums and apricots in their natural state (uncandied), they might have a different ranking, but based on the method applied in preserving them in your scenario, the plums have more crystallized sugar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: i. no ii. yes","output":"Imagine you have a pot full of tiny toys, and these toys represent molecules. The toys are holding hands, and this is similar to the intermolecular forces. Now, imagine you want to remove some toys from the pot. You have to shake it harder if the toys are holding hands very tightly, which represents strong intermolecular forces. On the other hand, if the toys are holding hands loosely, you can remove them more easily, which represents weak intermolecular forces. Boiling point is like shaking this pot of toys to remove them (or turning liquid into gas). If the intermolecular forces are strong, it takes more energy (heat) to break them apart, which means a higher boiling point. If the forces are weak, less energy is needed, which means a lower boiling point. Now, let's talk about HCl. HCl is like two friends (the elements hydrogen and chlorine) holding hands. Their bond type is a special one called a polar covalent bond. In this bond, chlorine is bigger and stronger, so it pulls the electrons towards itself a bit more, making it slightly negative. On the other hand, hydrogen becomes slightly positive because it has fewer electrons near it. This creates a small force (called a dipole) that can attract other HCl molecules, forming intermolecular forces.

The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Here are the steps to solve the problem: Task: Find the remainder when the square of a number is divided by 6. Guidelines: 1. The number, when divided by 6, leaves a remainder of 3. 2. We have provided options for the remainder: a) 0, b) 1, c) 2, d) 3, e) 4 Solution: 1. Let the number be n. According to the guideline 1, n % 6 = 3. That means n can be written as n = 6k + 3 (where k is an integer). 2. We need to find the remainder when the square of the number (n^2) is divided by 6. 3. Now, we can substitute n from step 1 into the expression n^2: (6k + 3)^2. 4. Expand the expression: (6k + 3)^2 = 36k^2 + 36k + 9. 5. Now, we will find the remainder when this expression is divided by 6.    (36k^2 + 36k + 9) % 6 = (36k^2 % 6) + (36k % 6) + (9 % 6). 6. Find the remainders individually:    36k^2 % 6 = 0 (as 36 is divisible by 6),    36k % 6 = 0 (again, as 36 is divisible by 6),    9 % 6 = 3. 7. Now, we sum these remainders:    0 + 0 + 3 = 3. So, the remainder when the square of the number is divided by 6 is 3. Therefore, the correct option is: Student: d) 3"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -2476*y - 13382 = -257*y - 5780 + 36778 for y, we need to follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation by combining constant terms on the right side of the equation:    -2476*y - 13382 = -257*y + (36778 - 5780)    -2476*y - 13382 = -257*y + 30998 2. Move the '-257*y' term to the left side of the equation by adding '257*y' to both sides:    -2476*y + 257*y - 13382 = 30998    (-2476 + 257)*y - 13382 = 30998    -2219*y - 13382 = 30998 3. Move the '-13382' term to the right side of the equation by adding '13382' to both sides:    -2219*y = 30998 + 13382    -2219*y = 44380 4. Divide both sides of the equation by '-2219' to find the value of 'y':    y = 44380 / -2219 5.

He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount.

I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other.

During flu season people flocked to the pharmacies to buy aspirin but not medication because the  OPT: (1). aspirin was sold out.. (2). medication was sold out..","output":"(2). medication was sold out. During the peak of the flu season in the small town of Glenfield, people flocked to the local pharmacies to buy aspirin but not medication because the medication was sold out. The pharmaceutical companies had underestimated the demand, and with delivery delays, the stock had quickly depleted. The locals were left to rely on over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin to alleviate their symptoms. Meanwhile, Glenfield's town council took notice of the situation and held an emergency meeting to discuss potential solutions. The mayor, Gwen Hawthorne, was concerned for her town's well-being. Glenfield was a close-knit community, and many of the locals were getting more sick by the day.  Gwen initiated a temporary healthcare committee that was tasked with quickly finding an alternative solution. The members consisted of local doctors, pharmacists, and healthcare consultants, including Dr. Mike Novak, pharmacist Beth Landon, and healthcare consultant Jim Stevens.  The team quickly got to work, brainstorming different approaches to ease the situation. Some sought to expedite the delivery of medications, while others proposed contacting surrounding towns to check for available stock. Jim Stevens, a seasoned healthcare consultant, recommended reaching out to local medicine-making practices, suggesting that traditional remedies could alleviate the burden on the pharmaceutical supply. The committee members divided tasks, with Dr. Novak and Beth Landon contacting nearby towns and pharmacies, while Jim Stevens worked on connecting with local herbal medicine practitioners. A few days later, Dr. Novak secured a limited supply of the necessary medication from a neighboring town, Butte Springs, scheduled for delivery within the week. However, that wouldn't be enough to cover the needs of the town's population. Meanwhile, Jim met with Martin Jamison, a local herbalist who had a wealth of knowledge about plant-based remedies that could be used to counter the symptoms of the flu. Martin shared recipes for various herbal teas and extracts that could alleviate congestion and soothe sore throats. He even taught the community how to make their own homemade syrups using ingredients like honey, lemon, and ginger. Gwen decided that investing in these alternative solutions would be a wise move for the town, and she organized workshops for locals to learn about the power of herbal medicine. By the following weekend, Glenfield's community hall was filled with concerned residents who eagerly participated in the workshops, learning from Martin and practicing their newfound skills. Word spread quickly, and as the herbal remedies began to ease the pressure on medical supplies, Glenfield locals supported one another in their time of need. Neighbors shared their homemade teas, syrups, and remedies, forming an even stronger sense of community. Within a few weeks, the flu outbreak was on the decline, and thanks to the collaborative efforts of everyone involved, recovery was swift. Although the town still needed modern medicine, the flu season had taught the people of Glenfield the importance of local resources and the power of unity. Residents gained a new appreciation for herbal remedies, which continued to thrive as a supplementary practice in the town. The healthcare committee remained active, consistently working on improving the local healthcare system and keeping an eye on the town's well-being. In the end, the flu season that threatened to overwhelm the small town of Glenfield had unexpectedly brought the residents closer together. It had ignited a sense of empowerment, resilience, and comradery among the people who had lived in fear of the illness. They had found strength in one another and learned to collaborate for the greater good of their community, leaving a lasting impact on Glenfield's future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A pair of arguments is considered SIMILAR if the arguments are about the same FACET (making the same argument), and is considered NOT SIMILAR if they do not have the same FACET. A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position.

Output:","output":"Part #1: Classify argument pairs into SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR Usage: Classify the following argument pairs as SIMILAR if they share the same FACET, and NOT SIMILAR if they do not. In this case, the arguments are NOT SIMILAR, because Sent1 is discussing the effectiveness of gun control in stopping people from making their own guns, while Sent2 is discussing children's access to their parents' guns. These two arguments involve different aspects of the gun control issue. Part #2: Define FACET Usage: A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position. For example, in the gun control debate, a FACET could be the effectiveness of background checks in preventing criminals from obtaining guns. Both SIMILAR arguments would address this specific aspect of the gun control issue. Part #3: Arguments about the same FACET Usage: Arguments are about the same FACET if they are making the same point or discussing the same aspect of the issue. In this case, Sent1 and Sent2 are NOT SIMILAR, because they don't share the same FACET. Sent1 focuses on the effectiveness of gun control, while Sent2 is about children's access to guns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: I want to buy a bike but I cannot pay the whole amount at once. Now I am ready to pay an installment. Which would be a better option, a vehicle loan or a credit card? Second question: Can you buy online and pay with a credit card in installments? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: When deciding between a vehicle loan and a credit card for purchasing a bike, several factors should be considered to determine the better option for your specific situation. 1. Interest rates: Vehicle loans tend to have lower interest rates compared to credit cards. Therefore, opting for a vehicle loan may be more cost-effective in the long run. However, it's essential to compare the rates offered by multiple lenders to get the best deal possible. 2. Loan term (duration): Vehicle loans typically have a fixed repayment schedule, often ranging from 2 to 5 years. This allows you to spread the cost of the bike over a more extended period. Credit cards, on the other hand, provide more flexibility in terms of repayment, but this can lead to higher interest costs if you only pay the minimum amount each month. 3. Approval requirements: Vehicle loans may come with stricter application processes and credit score requirements compared to credit cards. You might need to provide proof of income, employment history, and a credit check to qualify for a loan. If you don't meet these requirements, you may find it difficult to get a vehicle loan. 4. Ownership: When you purchase a bike through a vehicle loan, the lender holds the ownership of the bike as collateral until you have paid off the loan in full. In contrast, with a credit card, you are the owner of the bike upfront. 5. Additional fees and charges: Vehicle loans may come with application, processing, and prepayment penalties that you should be aware of. Credit cards may also have fees, such as annual fees or foreign transaction fees, depending on the card you choose. Considering these factors will help you determine whether a vehicle loan or a credit card is a better option for purchasing a bike on installments. Second question: Yes, you can buy a bike online and pay with a credit card in installments. Many online retailers offer various payment options, including installments via credit card or third-party financing options. These financing options may come with promotional offers, such as 0% interest for a specified period or deferred interest. These two questions are related, but they are not asking the same thing. The first question is about comparing vehicle loans and credit cards for purchasing a bike, while the second question focuses on using a credit card to pay for a bike online in installments specifically. The first question compares two different financing options, whereas the second question confirms the possibility of using one of those options (credit card) for online shopping, specifically for buying a bike in installments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once an elite cadre of glamorous pros catering almost exclusively to well-heeled passengers, they now have to face the grumblings of overcrowded masses while wearing unflattering polyester suits. Virgin Atlantic wants to restore some lost dignity, however, with redesigned uniforms by the British fashion icon Vivienne Westwood. The partnership with Richard Branson’s airline updates the wardrobe of in-flight and ground employees, bringing elegance and tailored touches to uniforms that had grown boxy and generic. But don’t expect the punk-infused haute couture that has become Westwood’s signature; the new uniforms play it relatively safe. Instead of referencing space-age travel, Westwood channeled the feminine silhouettes of 1940s French fashion. For female flight attendants, Westwood created a jacket inspired by an early-1990s design featuring a nipped-in waist and an oversize high collar in Virgin’s signature red. A matching pencil skirt includes the most daring detail: darted seams that emphasize the bum. A red double-breasted overcoat, a handbag and hourglass heels (offered in three heights) complete the vintage-looking ensemble. Pants do not seem to be an option. One can argue that Westwood brought sexiness back into stewardess attire, but is that something that should be applauded? Gianfranco Ferré for Korean Air and Christian Lacroix for Air France both managed to inject modern sophistication into airline uniforms without remaking flight attendants into temptresses. Men get a more dignified makeover: a three-piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool. The standard trouser is an au courant slim cut, though regular fit is also available. Lads also get a classic Oxford shoe in matte black leather with a polished toe. Here, the red is an accent color, showing up only in the jacquard fabric tie. Many items in the new uniforms will be made from sustainable materials, including a polyester yarn made from recycled plastic bottles. The new threads, which will be worn by more than 7,500 staff, will officially take flight on Sept. 1.

This choice was driven by several factors that made the country house more appealing to her. First, Mom has always been an avid horse lover, and living in the country would provide her with ample opportunities to not only own horses but also to engage in various horse-related activities. She could easily build a stable for her horses, create a riding arena, and have direct access to trails and paths that would be perfect for riding. Additionally, living in the country would offer a peaceful and serene environment that is often hard to find in bustling cities. This would allow her to maintain a healthier lifestyle, with less exposure to noise pollution and the stress that comes with urban living. She could take up gardening, cultivate some fruit trees, go for nature walks, and indulge in an overall slower pace of life that would be both mentally and physically beneficial. Moreover, Mom also appreciated the close-knit community aspect that often comes with living in rural areas. She believed that fostering strong relationships with neighbors and participating in local events would help her family create lasting connections and feel more integrated and supported. This sense of belonging and companionship is sometimes lacking in the city, which can feel isolating despite the bustle. Another factor in her decision was the potential for a larger living space, both indoors and outdoors, that could be found in the country. This not only suited her desire to keep horses but also provided more room for her family to grow and thrive. Children could have more space to play and explore outdoors, and even family pets would benefit from the freedom offered by a rural house. Finally, the country would offer an opportunity for her to contribute directly to her family's well-being by growing fresh produce and keeping a few chickens for eggs. This would provide her family with healthy, organic food and a level of self-sufficiency that would be difficult to achieve in a city home. In summary, Mom chose the house in the country because she liked horses, as well as for the numerous benefits that this lifestyle would provide her and her family. From more space and a healthier environment to a sense of community and the possibility to engage in fulfilling, nature-based hobbies, living in the country was a choice that aligned more closely with her values and priorities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose the next sentence for this paragraph. (CNN) -- It's unlikely commercial aviation stories in 2014 will surpass those of 2013 for pizzazz or significance. This is probably a good thing. Who could have foreseen the three-month grounding of the entire Boeing 787 fleet when we forecast events for 2013? We were only 16 days into 2013 when 50 787s worldwide were grounded following a battery fire on a Japan Air Lines 787 and a near-fire occurred days later on an ANA 787 flight. Boeing Co. ended the year with embarrassing, dysfunctional standoff with its largest union, the International Association of Machinists District 751, over where the 777X (successor to the popular 777 airliner now in service) will be built. An EIS date slip from the original plan of December 2013 to mid-2015 (a period of about 18 months) would put the aircraft on a par with the A350's delays, but well ahead of the 3 Â½ years of delays for OPTIONS: - 777X's 787. - A350-800's 787. - ANA 787's 787. - Airbus's 787. - Boeing's 787. - Boeing 787's 787. - Boeing Co.'s 787. - Bombardier's 787. - CNN's 787. - International Association of Machinists District 751's 787. - Japan Air Lines's 787.","output":"Boeing's 787. The correct answer is \\"Boeing's 787\\" because the paragraph is discussing delays in the aviation industry, specifically relating to Boeing and its aircraft models like the 787.  Now, let's explain why the other options are wrong: 1. 777X's 787: This option is incorrect because the 777X is a different aircraft model from the 787, and the sentence should discuss the delays of Boeing's 787. 2. A350-800's 787: This option is wrong because the A350 is an aircraft made by Airbus, not Boeing, and it's not relevant to the topic in the paragraph. 3. ANA 787's 787: This doesn't make sense because ANA is an airline, and the sentence needs to refer to the delays of the aircraft model. 4. Airbus's 787: This option is incorrect because Airbus doesn't manufacture the 787 - this is a Boeing aircraft. 5. Boeing 787's 787: This is a repetitive statement, and it doesn't make sense. 6. Boeing Co.'s 787: This is very close to the correct answer, but it should be \\"Boeing's 787\\" for better consistency with the rest of the paragraph. 7. Bombardier's 787: This is wrong because Bombardier is another company that doesn't manufacture the 787 - that's a Boeing aircraft. 8. CNN's 787: This doesn't make sense because CNN is a news network, not an aircraft manufacturer or an airline. 9. International Association of Machinists District 751's 787: This is incorrect because it refers to the union involved in a dispute with Boeing, not the actual delay of the aircraft. 10. Japan Air Lines's 787: This option is incorrect because it refers to an airline company, and the focus of the sentence is on the delay of a specific aircraft model, the 787 built by Boeing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But when Kay returns from traveling in Hungary, she seems changed. First, she begins to express a morbid curiosity with the supernatural. Then, she brings back with her a gypsy fortune teller, Madame Zimba [Adeline DeWalt Reynolds]. Finally, she has invited Hungarian Count Alucard [Lon Chaney, Jr] to be a guest at Dark Oaks, the southern plantation where Kay lives with her father Colonel Caldwell [George Irving] and her sister Claire [Evelyn Ankers].On the night of Alucard's arrival, Kay throws a welcome party. But only Alucard's baggage arrives on the train; no Alucard. Madame Zimba warns Kay that Alucard is not who he says he is and that death looms over Dark Oaks. True to her word, Madame Zimba suddenly dies of a heart attack after seeing a bat. Later that evening, Colonel Caldwell also dies of a heart attack, and Alucard arrives at Dark Oaks.Days later, at the reading of the will, it is discovered that Kay inherits the plantation and Claire all the money. With no resources to care for the plantation, Kay should be worried, but she is not. In fact, she admits that this is the way she wants it. In addition, Kay does not intend anymore to marry Frank and appears to be seeing Alucard, but no one can find out where Alucard is staying or what happened to the two large boxes that arrived with his baggage. Claire and Dr. Harry Brewster [Frank Craven] wonder if Kay might be insane, and Brewster calls his Hungarian friend Professor Lazlo [J.

Q:I can use this background: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect.

He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.

He noticed they don't use any fertilizers or pesticides. He labeled this part of the study as case A. Then he visited a modern farming facility where they use tons of fertilizers and pesticides. He labeled this part of the study as case B.  Which place would have more contamianted groundwater, case A or case B? A:","output":"Groundwater contamination is primarily caused by the infiltration of chemicals into the ground, affecting the quality of the water. This often happens in farms where fertilizers and pesticides are used excessively; they interact with rainwater and soil to reach the groundwater. Therefore, the answer to the question would be case B: the modern farming facility. Let's delve deeper into these topics to understand why. In case A, John visits the Amish country, known for their traditional farming practices. Amish farming typically involves manual or horse-drawn equipment, crop rotation, and organic or natural methods of pest and weed control rather than the synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides that are common in industrial farming. These farming methods have a lower risk to contaminate groundwater because there's less chemical input to leach into the ground and possibly reach the water table. Furthermore, traditional Amish farming techniques often involve cover cropping and other practices that improve soil health and reduce runoff, further protecting the water quality. In contrast, in case B, John visits a modern farm that uses chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These contribute significantly to groundwater contamination. Pesticides, which are substances used to eliminate pests, can be extremely harmful to various forms of life including humans, especially when they infiltrate the water supply. Fertilizers can also seep into the groundwater, leading to contamination. The chemicals, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, common in many fertilizers, can cause a form of pollution known as nutrient pollution. These nutrients stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which uses up oxygen and can kill marine life.  When the fertilizers and pesticides are used in excess, the plants can't absorb everything. The excess then washes from the fields into the groundwater or into nearby rivers and/or lakes, potentially contaminating the water that wildlife and humans depend on.  The modern farming facility's practices of using heavy amounts of pesticides and fertilizers can lead to non-point source pollution, a type of water pollution that's hard to trace back to a single point because it comes from many sources. This pollution can spread out over a large area, affecting the groundwater beneath. In conclusion, it is more likely that the groundwater under the modern farming facility (case B) would be more contaminated than that under the Amish farmland (case A) due to the extensive use of chemicals in contemporary farming methods. So John's study is identifying a crucial factor affecting groundwater contamination: the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in modern farming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The section whose liquid crystalline range corresponds to the temperature of the body becomes translucent (here shown in green), indicating the temperature. We also see the effect of liquid crystals in nature. Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up their external skeletons, not because of light absorption from their pigment. The cells form helices with a structure like those found in cholesteric liquid crystals. When the pitch of the helix is close to the wavelength of visible light, the cells reflect light with wavelengths that lead to brilliant metallic colors. Because a color change occurs depending on a person’s angle of view, researchers in New Zealand are studying the beetles to develop a thin material that can be used as a currency security measure. The automobile industry is also interested in exploring such materials for use in paints that would change color at different viewing angles. With only molecular structure as a guide, one cannot precisely predict which of the various liquid crystalline phases a given compound will actually form.

Equation: -32*a = -46 - 18 Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -46 and -18 are like terms since they are both constants. -46 - 18 = -64 So now, our equation becomes: -32*a = -64 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by -32. To do this, we will perform the following operation: (-32*a) / (-32) = -64 / (-32) On the left side of the equation, -32 in the numerator and -32 in the denominator will cancel each other out, leaving just 'a': a = -64 / (-32) Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation. The right side of the equation consists of two negative numbers being divided: -64 / (-32) Since dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result: 64 / 32 Now, we'll divide 64 by 32: 64 / 32 = 2 So, the final simplified equation is: a = 2 The solution to the equation -32*a = -46 - 18 is a = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: HONESDALE, Pa. (AP) — A 10-year-old boy charged with fatally beating a 90-year-old woman remained in adult prison Wednesday after his lawyer withdrew a request for bail, saying his family isn't ready to have him released into their custody.      The boy, who is charged as an adult with criminal homicide, appeared via a video hookup for a hearing, burying his face in his hands at times but not speaking.      The boy's family believes he is being treated well at the county prison, where he is being housed alone in a cell and being kept away from the general population, said his attorney, Bernard Brown. He said the boy was being provided recreational opportunities and coloring books.      Brown had filed a petition to have the boy released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility. But he said the family was not comfortable having him placed in their care right now. He didn't elaborate on the reasons.      The closest juvenile detention center is 80 miles away, which would make family visits inconvenient, Brown said. Judge Raymond Hamill said he was also concerned about moving the boy to a juvenile center and exposing him to \\"elements more detrimental to his well-being.\\"      The attorney still plans to seek to have the case transferred to juvenile court.      The boy is among the youngest charged with homicide in Pennsylvania, a list that includes two 11-year-olds and a 9-year-old, said Marsha Levick, chief counsel of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia.      Levick said the case belongs in juvenile court, calling it a \\"no-brainer.\\"      \\"He's a little boy,\\" she said. \\"It's a horrible tragedy, but it's shocking that he suddenly turned into an adult because of conduct that he engaged in.\\"      Prosecutors had said that they had no choice but to charge him as an adult. In Pennsylvania, homicide charges must be filed in adult court. Judges can then move the cases to juvenile court when deemed appropriate.      District Attorney Janine Edwards said she will wait for the results of a mental health evaluation before deciding whether to contest having the case moved to juvenile court.      Detectives who executed a search of the boy's cell Wednesday turned up a piece of notebook paper with the words \\"How to Escape\\" on it, a court document showed. But the prosecutor told The Wayne Independent in Honesdale that nothing else of significance was found on the paper.      The beating Saturday occurred at the home of the boy's grandfather, who had been caring for the woman, Helen Novak.      According to the boy's mother, her son said he lost his temper when he went into the woman's room to ask her a question and she yelled at him. Authorities said the boy briefly held Novak down with a cane and then punched her in the throat and stomach.      The boy told a state trooper that he was \\"only trying to hurt her,\\" but also acknowledged, \\"I killed that lady,\\" according to the arrest affidavit. ||||| Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, ten-year-old Tristen Kurilla appeared at the Wayne County courthouse only by video-conference Wednesday.            He kept his head in his hands as his attorney withdrew a request to have him released from prison.            \\"Their family just doesn't feel comfortable for numerous reasons, not only of the supervision, of work, of everything but also in a concern of Ms. Novak and her family too\\" said Bernie Brown, Defense Attorney            The decision means the ten-year-old will remain behind bars in Wayne County.            Kurilla is accused of using a walking stick to choke 90-year-old Helen Novak inside this home in Damascus Township Saturday.            The boy also allegedly punched the woman five times in the throat.            The boy has already spent two nights in jail.                  \\"He is not in general population. He is not in solitary confinement and he is not in isolation. He is in a cell which I believe is next to the infirmary where he can come and go from the cell to the infirmary. He is under 24 hour supervision\\" said Janine Edwards, Wayne County District Attorney            Kurilla's attorney Bernie Brown says the boy understands where he is and what has happened but is focused more on things a normal ten year old would be, referencing his prison outfit and not the possible life sentence he could face.                  \\"He talked about that being a Halloween costume and that he'd probably never wear that as a Halloween costume because that's what most kids his age are thinking about right now\\"            Brown says he expects to file a request to have this case moved to juvenile court by Thursday.            That would put the decision on how this case proceeds in the hands of a judge.                  \\"At that time, experts have to be involved to evaluate the defendant and we would go from there with a hearing being set. I can't guess for you what the time frame would be\\" said District Attorney Janine Edwards       ||||| Summary:","output":"A 10-year-old boy has been charged with fatally beating a 90-year-old woman and is currently being held in an adult prison.

Eventually he clashes in midair with a stork delivering a kangaroo joey, leading to Bugs getting switched with the joey, brought to Australia, and dropped into a kangaroo's arms.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick your answer from: [-] Yes [-] No Q: If I tell you that An animal requires food to grow and heal, and ask you the question \\"what does an animal require to grow and heal?\\", is the correct answer \\"pH\\"? A:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"pH\\".  When you're asked about what an animal requires to grow and heal, referring to \\"pH\\" would not provide a complete or largely accurate answer.  The pH, which stands for potential Hydrogen, is a scale used to specify the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution. While it's true that animals' bodies do require a certain pH balance to maintain their metabolic functions effectively, it is not the primary factor when it comes to growth or healing. Instead, these processes primarily depend on nutrients and energy that animals get from their food.  Animals need a well-balanced diet to grow effectively. Growth occurs as animals intake food and utilize the nutrients and energy this food provides. For instance, proteins are critical for growth as they provide the necessary amino acids for the building of tissues and muscles, carbohydrates supply the energy required to fuel processes such as growth, and vitamins and minerals are essential for various bodily functions and biochemical reactions.  Similarly, when it comes to healing, the type and amount of food animals eat is also equally important. After an injury or illness, animals need additional nutrients to repair damaged tissues and restore their health. Proteins are vital as they are the building blocks of tissue repair and regeneration. Certain minerals like zinc and vitamins such as Vitamin C and Vitamin A are also important for wound healing. So, the primary requirement for an animal's growth and healing is not pH, but rather adequate and nutritious food. pH levels within the body have their role in overall health, but they are maintained by the body's buffer systems and aren't directly influenced in the same way as growth or healing through food consumption.  Thus, while maintaining the correct pH balance within the body is a key part of overall health, it is not the direct answer to what an animal requires to grow and heal. That would be nutrient-rich food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Tara Brady. Guilty: Sir George Castledine started a relationship with an 83-year-old widow out of sexual desire and financial greed, a panel has ruled. A knighted nurse who had an affair with an 83-year-old widow he was counselling following the death of her husband was struck off today. Sir George Castledine, 67, declared his love for the recently bereaved woman, known during regular visits to her home and called her ‘my little tinkerbell.’ Sir George, who shook his head as the decision was announced, has been thrown out of the profession and cannot apply to be restored to the register for five years. Susan Hurds, NMC panel chairman said: ‘Your actions represent a serious departure from the standards expected from a registered nurse. ‘You have been dishonest during the course of this investigation and were deliberately evasive and inconsistent while giving evidence. ‘You have shown no remorse for your actions and the effect they have had on Patient A and her family. ‘You have a distinguished career of over 40 years as an author, clinician, educator and mentor and have made a substantial contribution to the nursing profession, including care for older people. ‘The misconduct was wide-ranging and continued beyond the limits outlined in the charges, you continued to see Patient A after receiving written instructions not to. ‘You sought to mislead the panel and you lied to the panel during these proceedings. ‘During your evidence to the panel you tried to blame Patient A for pestering you. ‘You have failed to satisfy the panel that you are remorseful and that there will be no repetition of the misconduct. ‘Your actions are so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with your remaining on the register. ‘A striking off order is the only proportionate sanction.’ Sir George Castledine declared his love for the recently bereaved woman and told her he needed to work out at the gym so he could 'make love' to her. Treatment: Sir George first started working with the widow at Onneley House in Birmingham in November 2008. He denied that his behaviour was motivated by financial gain or sexual desire - but a committee sitting at the Old Bailey in London has now ruled that this was in fact false. Sir George regularly visited the elderly patient and showered her with gifts and flowers, accepting thousands of pounds in return. The woman's family became so concerned about his behaviour that they bugged her phone - and heard him calling her 'Tinkerbell' and saying he had to go to the gym or he 'wouldn't be able to make love' to her. NMC panel chairman Susan Hurds said today that he had 'manipulated a vulnerable patient' while motivated by sexual gratification and greed. She added that the woman, known as 'Patient A', was 'clearly grief-stricken' following the death of her husband, and needed bereavement counselling which Sir George was not qualified to give. 'You gave evidence which the panel often found difficult to believe,' Mrs Hurds told Sir George. 'You lacked consistency in your response, added evidence and altered your story as it suited you. 'We concluded that you lied at the outset of the investigation and as the hearing continued. As evidence was put before you you modified your account. 'The panel finds it incredible that the endearments and erotic language you used at no other time than on the occasions on the tape. 'You were deliberately evasive and not consistent but intentionally changed your story.' She added: 'The persistent nature of the telephone calls, late at night and early in the morning and the giving of gifts and eating together in an intimate setting were sexually motivated.' Sir George - who was knighted in 2007. - first treated the woman in November 2008 at Onneley House in. Birmingham, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health. After. the patient told her two daughters that she had begun an affair with. the married father of three, they bugged her phone and were horrified to. hear his repeated professions of love. Distinguished: Sir George was knighted by the Queen in a 2007 ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Mrs Hurds said that the sisters acted solely out of concern for their mother, and were not motivated by financial gain. Sir George, currently a visiting professor at Glyndwr University in Wrexham, insisted that his chats with Patient A were nothing more than 'banter'. He told the hearing: 'Some of the phone calls later were sexual in some respects but it wasn't an offer of having sex with somebody or anything like that. 'One of the times I spoke to her she was having some trouble so I called her and on the telephone we would have banter. It was a befriending role that I had and I was befriending her.' The nurse had previously admitted the contents of his conversations with the woman, and confessed that he had continued to see her even after he was told not to by an official. Sir George formerly sat on the Welsh board of a predecessor to the NMC, and helped draw up the code of conduct for nursing which he has now breached. He is a former assistant dean of the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University, and an ex-consultant at Dudley Group of Hospitals. Highlights:","output":"1.

Rita Haldar, a 28-year-old homemaker, lodged the complaint with the Farakka police on February 2, naming her husband Biswajit Sarkar, mother-in-law and brother-in-law.

In the face of numerous environmental challenges, it's essential for any economy to prioritize sustainable growth and invest in the future. The focus should be on promoting environmentally friendly industries that can positively contribute to the well-being of both the planet and its inhabitants. By adopting this approach, we can create new job opportunities and drive innovation that would lead us to a more promising future. There are several reasons why it's crucial to prioritize environmentally friendly industries: 1. Mitigating climate change: Numerous industrial processes emit harmful gases, including carbon dioxide, which contribute to the greenhouse effect. By focusing on green industries, we can reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner, healthier environment. 2. Conserving resources: Traditional industries often use resources inefficiently and, in many cases, those resources are non-renewable. Eco-friendly industries, on the other hand, typically prioritize the efficient use of resources and the adoption of renewable and sustainable alternatives. 3. Enhancing biodiversity: Deforestation, pollution, and habitat destruction caused by some industries have led to a decrease in biodiversity. Environmentally friendly industries, however, work towards preserving ecosystems and maintaining ecological balance. 4. Improving human health: Air, water, and soil pollution from certain industries negatively impact human health. By promoting green industries, we can help ensure a safer living environment for everyone. To create new job opportunities in environmentally friendly industries, three strategies can be used: 1. Investments: Both government and private sector entities should fund research and development in areas focused on sustainable growth, such as renewable energy, circular economy projects, and eco-friendly agriculture. This will create job opportunities and encourage entrepreneurship in these sectors. 2. Education and training: An essential element of fostering any new industry is having a workforce prepared for it. Governments and educational institutions must ensure that necessary educational and training programs are in place to prepare individuals for careers in green industries. Moreover, re-training programs should be provided for those transitioning from traditional industries. 3. Incentives and policies: Policies such as tax breaks, grants, and subsidies can incentivize businesses to invest in environmentally friendly sectors. Governments should also consider adopting regulations and guidelines that encourage the sustainable use of resources and reduce pollution. By focusing on the growth of environmentally friendly industries and letting go of old industries that do not contribute positively to environmental health, we can create new job opportunities, protect our planet, and build a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is some data: Barny Cakes DISH_VARIATION Strawberry; Barny Cakes PROTEIN 1.8 g; Barny Cakes FAT 4.8 g; Barny Cakes CARBOHYDRATE 18.0 g. Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"This data presents nutritional information for a specific type of snack known as Barny Cakes. Barny Cakes are a popular food item that consists primarily of a cake base with various fillings or toppings, providing consumers with a delicious and convenient snack option. In this particular case, the dish variation mentioned is \\"Strawberry,\\" suggesting that the Barny Cake has a distinct strawberry flavor as a key feature of its taste profile. The nutritional properties of these Strawberry Barny Cakes can be broken down into three primary macronutrients: proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 1. Proteins: Proteins are essential building blocks for the body, playing a vital role in muscle growth, tissue repair, and enzyme creation. In each serving of Strawberry Barny Cakes, there is 1.8 grams of protein content. For the average adult, the recommended daily intake of protein may vary depending on factors such as body weight, activity level, and gender. However, a general guideline for protein intake ranges from 46 to 56 grams per day. Given this information, consuming a Strawberry Barny Cake contributes a modest amount of protein to an individual's daily requirement. 2. Fats: Fats fall into a few different categories: saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats. Saturated and trans fats are typically considered unhealthy, as they can raise LDL (\\"bad\\") cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, can improve heart health and provide necessary energy to the body. The Strawberry Barny Cakes currently contain 4.8 grams of fat per serving. Without details regarding the specific type of fat present in the product, it's difficult to assess the health impact of this macronutrient. However, it is advisable to consume fats in moderation and also choose sources of healthy fats when possible. 3. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates serve as a pivotal source of energy for the body and can be found in various forms, including sugars, starches, and fibers. The Strawberry Barny Cakes provide 18.0 grams of carbohydrates per serving, which may contain some combination of these different forms. Carbohydrate needs for an individual can vary based on factors such as age, sex, weight, and activity level. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that 45-65% of daily calorie intake should come from carbohydrates. Therefore, this snack contributes a reasonable amount of carbohydrates to an individual's daily consumption, and it's essential to consider other carbohydrate sources and total daily intake to maintain a balanced diet. In summary, the provided data offers a glimpse into the nutritional value of Strawberry Barny Cakes. With 1.8 grams of protein, 4.8 grams of fat, and 18.0 grams of carbohydrates per serving, these cakes serve as a source of essential macronutrients, although it's vital to monitor intake, especially regarding specific types of fats and additional carbohydrate sources.

The house had bad insulation in the bathroom but not in the bedroom, so the","output":"bathroom always felt colder than the bedroom. This made taking a bath or a shower very chilly, especially during the winter months when it's freezing outside.  One day, Tom, a little boy, decided that he wanted to fix the insulation in the bathroom, so he could take a nice warm bath. To understand his plan, let's first talk about insulation. Insulation is like a big blanket that keeps your house warm by not allowing the heat to escape outside. The bigger and fluffier the blanket is, the more it keeps you warm, just like during bedtime when the blanket keeps you warm while you're sleeping. So, Tom thought to himself, \\"What can I use to make the bathroom's insulation better?\\" He looked around his house for materials that could act like a big, warm blanket for his bathroom. He saw fluffy towels, blankets, and even some old clothes that he thought might work.  He started hanging up the fluffy towels and blankets on the walls of the bathroom, and even stuffed some clothes in the tiny gaps where the cold air was sneaking in. It took him all day, but finally, he managed to cover every wall of the bathroom. The next day, Tom decided to take a bath to see if his insulation plan worked. He filled the tub with warm water and bubbles, and slowly stepped in. To his surprise, the bathroom felt much warmer than before! Tom had successfully made the bathroom more insulated and cozy. Tom's creative solution had worked, and he happily shared the news with his family. From then on, they all enjoyed warm baths and showers throughout the cold winter months, all thanks to Tom's clever idea and hard work on improving the bathroom's insulation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Fact 2: Influenza Virus Influenza viruses make up the family Orthomyxoviridae.  Given the two facts above, what cannot reproduce by themselves? Possible answers: + fungi + insects + influenza + Leptospirosis + bacteria + ferns + mammals + acetic acid Answer:","output":"Influenza viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. The first fact states that viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. This includes all viruses, not just a specific type or family. Viruses need a host cell to reproduce, as they lack the necessary cellular machinery to do so. They infect a host cell and hijack its replication machinery to create copies of themselves, which can then go on to infect new host cells. The second fact specifically mentions influenza viruses, which are a part of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Just like other viruses, influenza viruses also rely on host cells for their reproduction. They typically infect epithelial cells in the respiratory tract of humans and animals, using the host cell machinery to make numerous copies of themselves that are eventually released to infect other cells. Hence, given the two facts, influenza viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. While the other possible answers listed include various organisms and a chemical compound (acetic acid), it is important to note that each of these options either has the ability to reproduce on their own (fungi, insects, bacteria, ferns, and mammals) or is not a living organism capable of reproduction (acetic acid).

Masami Akita (Qiu Tian  Chang Mei , Akita Masami, born December 19, 1956), better known by his stage name Merzbow (merutsubau, Merutsubau), is a Japanese noise musician. He is best known for his style of harsh, confrontational noise exemplified on his 1996 release, Pulse Demon. Since 1980, he has released over 400 recordings, and has collaborated with various artists. During the European tour in September-October 1989, Merzbow could only bring simple and portable gear; this led to the harsh noise style Merzbow became known for in the 1990s. Cloud Cock OO Grand (1990) was the first example of this new style, Merzbow's first digital recording (on DAT), and the first recording made for the CD format. It also includes live material recorded during the tour.  But when I started live in late 1980s I didn't like to use tape on stage. I like only live electronics. So, my studio works changed to more live composition style. I'm still using many tapes in studio works, but difference is I treat tapes and instruments. Before, I used tapes as overdubbing concept. But now tapes are crashing together, no static overdub. I found that style on Cloud Cock OO Grand.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, Merzbow began to be influenced by death metal and grindcore. Recordings from this time are mostly recorded at extreme volume, some mastered at levels far beyond standard (Noisembryo, Pulse Demon). In 1994, Akita acquired a vintage EMS synthesizer. From 1996, plans were made to release a \\"10 (or maybe 12)\\" CD box set on Extreme Records. In 2000, Extreme Records released the Merzbox, a fifty CD set of Merzbow records, twenty of them not previously released.  Throughout most of the 1990s, Merzbow live was a trio with Reiko A. on electronics and Bara on voice and dance. Masami Akita occasionally played drums for Hijokaidan during the early-mid 1990s.  In the early 1990s, Masami Akita composed the soundtracks to numerous kinbaku videos by Fuji Planning (Bu Er Qi Hua , Fuji Kikaku) and seppuku-themed videos by their sub-label Right Brain. Akita also directed Lost Paradise (Shi Le Yuan  Cheng Ma Fu Nu Fu Qie ri, Shitsurakuen: Jobafuku onna harakiri) for Right Brain. Some of this music was included on Music for Bondage Performance and Music for Bondage Performance 2, co-credited to Right Brain Audile. Director Ian Kerkhof would use a Merzbow track for his 1992 film La sequence des barres paralleles, and Akita composed original music for Kerhof's 1994 film The Dead Man 2: Return of the Dead Man. Kerkhof made the documentary Beyond Ultra Violence: Uneasy Listening by Merzbow in 1998. Akita also created music for Ilppo Pohjola's Asphalto (1998) and Routemaster (2000).

Article: Face-to-face communication involves much more than the spoken word.In fact, we often communicate our feelings to others through our body language without realizing we are doing so.We communicate through posture, gesture and facial expression.But the eyes also play an important part in this unspoken language.William Shakespeare called the eyes \\"a window to the soul,\\" and you can learn to look through that window and better understand a person's body language by reading eye movement. Begin a conversation and ask a simple question.Watch carefully for eye movement during the response.If the person looks up, he or she is thinking or forming pictures.This is also a sign of a visual thinker.Looking up and to the left shows recalling a memory, while looking up and to the right could show imaginative construction or lying. If the person looks down, this could be a sign of obedience  or even blame.Looking down and to the left can show a person talking to themselves.Looking down and to the right can show that they are feeling strong emotion. Looking sideways can indicate distraction or checking out a potential  threat, hut a sideways glance can also show anger.In addition, eyes that look side to side often show shiftiness  and lying. A glance usually indicates a desire for something.Glancing at a door could show a desire to leave the room, while a glance, at a person could indicate a desire to talk to them.A glance is also used when it is forbidden to look at something. A person who is lying to you may hold eye contact longer than normal.In addition, this person might smile with his mouth but not with his eyes.Smiling with the eyes is difficult to do if the emotion is not genuine. Rapid blinking of the eyes can occur when a person is thinking, and this can also be another sign of lying.Again, a person who is aware of this sign might overcompensate  and stare. Question: Which of the following eye movement shows a dishonest speaker? Answer: Available options: + If he looks up and to the left. + If he looks up and to the right. + If he looks down and to the left. + If he looks down and to the right.

Ross was a prominent political figure who served as the 37th Governor of Delaware, United States. He was born on 2nd of June, 1814, in Laurel, Delaware. Professionally, Ross was a farmer, coming from a humble background. Ross started his term as Governor of Delaware on January 21, 1851, and his governance lasted for four years until January 16, 1855. His predecessor was William Tharp and he was succeeded by Peter F. Causey. During his term, he was a member of the Democratic Party, a major political party in the United States. Ross's tenure was significantly important and met with numerous events that shaped the course of his state. Away from his public service, Ross was also a devoted Methodist, adhering to one of the largest branches of Protestant Christianity, which lays emphasis on good deeds and active expressions of faith. In terms of his personal life, Ross was married to Emeline Hall. The couple made their home in Seaford, Delaware, which was their residence for a significant part of their lives. At the end of his life, Ross moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he passed away on June 30, 1887. He left behind a legacy of service, dedication, and a distinct contribution to the governance of Delaware. Although his picture (williamross.gif) might not be readily available for viewing in this context, it surely immortalizes his contributions and efforts for his state and his party, as well as a testament to the life of an influential governor in American history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? , can you please find it?   The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455  Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory. The answer to this question is:","output":"Hans Memling. According to Till-Holger Borchert, Memling might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Looks just like any other traveling carnival except this is one of those that charges you a 10 dollar admission just so you can walk around just to decide how much more money to spend on food and/or rides.  The concept is basically like Disneyland except on a much more smaller, more ghettoish type of scale. I know, ghettoish really isn't a word but you catch my drift.   Yes, I know there is a Groupon and Living Social deal for 5 bucks but that's besides the point. The fact that you have to pay just to get in only to be disappointed is what I consider time lost which equals money lost.  The rides they have are basic, nothing really stands out. Each ride takes a certain amount of tickets and of course you have to get just enough tickets just to ride 2 or 3. Really not worth it. Even with the all day ride pass.  As for the number 1 reason why most people go here is the food. First stop was the Dole Pineapple Whip booth. I got kind of excited because the only place that I knew had this was Disneyland where the Enchanted Tiki Room was. This place even had the words Tiki Treats in the upper left hand corner of their stand. What I found out was that it was a definite knockoff. Their largest size Float Whip was 5  bucks and my two kids easily devoured it in under 30 seconds meaning it wast that large at all. I tasted it and it was no where near what Disneyland serves.  Next stop. Soul Food Cafu00e9 Express. My boys were feenin for Deep Fried Catfish with Fries and Dirty Rice as the sides. I ordered just one combo so they can share since we were gonna be eating other things. Cost 8 bucks. When we got our food, the two breaded filets were really good. As for the fries, they were soggy and was still dripping in grease. It seemed to only have been cooked halfway like they forgot about it after the fish was done so they through it in the fryer real quick only to pull it out prematurely. The Dirty Rice could have literally been dirty like it was dropped several times on the floor making its way to the skinny cardboard food holders they give you. It looked more like oatmeal sprinkled with seasonings. So basically we paid 8 bucks for two filets of breaded catfish.  Next stop. Wing King. Now these guys I am definitely familiar with. I got a Review Of The Day (ROTD) for their 6475 W Charleston location.  I got Fried Pickle Chips for 5 bucks and 10 Honey Barbeque Wings for 12 bucks. Both items I got my money's worth and just like their home location, it was very good.  Last Stop. Mama Ita's Roasted Corn. We came here to get Funnel Cakes. Damn, 7 bucks. At least you get strawberries, powdered sugar, and whipped cream on it. Probably the most expensive Funnel Cake I ever ate.  The worst thing I have to mention are the Port O Potties. Not only are they nasty, but according to my wife, none of them even had any toilet paper. Good luck if there is any soap or water left.

Review: They are OK, but not as plumb as shown. The chocolate coating is somewhat disappointing, not what I expected. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review provided can be characterized as having a mixed sentiment, leaning more towards the negative side.  To break down the aspects of the review, one can identify the following: 1. \\"Not as Plump as shown\\": This statement clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the product's appearance as it did not meet the reviewer's expectations based on the images provided. This conveys a negative sentiment. 2. \\"They are OK\\": This statement is neutral and suggests that the product is not bad, but the reviewer is not highly impressed either. The use of the word \\"OK\\" illustrates that they find the product to be average and not particularly remarkable.  3. \\"The chocolate coating is somewhat disappointing\\": Disappointment in the chocolate coating is clearly stated here, which means that the reviewer had higher expectations in terms of taste and may have compared it to other similar products they have tried that presumably had a better chocolate coating. This statement carries a negative sentiment. 4. \\"Not what I expected\\": This statement reinforces the negative sentiment regarding expectations not being met. This further solidifies the overall sentiment leaning towards the negative side. While there are some neutral phrases present in the review, the majority of the statements emphasize disappointment and unmet expectations. The presence of dissatisfaction in terms of product appearance and taste are key factors that lead to the conclusion that this review primarily conveys a negative sentiment with a hint of neutrality, rather than a positive one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the options: The first step is to assess each given option and understand the context of the question. We know it's about a location shared by many companies and a rosebush. 2. Process of elimination: We can eliminate \\"lawn\\" and \\"backyard,\\" as those are specific to personal property and wouldn't necessarily be associated with thousands of companies. Similarly, \\"rose parade\\" is an event, not a place where companies and a rosebush would establish a permanent base. 3. Delaware's reputation as a corporate haven: Delaware is well known for being the home of thousands of companies due to its favorable corporate laws, tax policies, and a strong legal system. Considering these advantages, many corporations choose to incorporate in Delaware, even if they operate elsewhere. 4. Interpretation of the question: Taking into account the context of the question and the given options, a human might interpret the question as asking for a shared location that accommodates both a rosebush and a large number of companies. The more abstract option of \\"planting\\" could be considered but doesn't directly suggest a location. 5.

YOU may think you can propose a 15 million renovation of the Central Park Zoo, as the Parks Department just did, but you're going to be hearing about it from Class 5-313. This is, of course, Rita Galett's class of fifth graders in P.S. 158, on York Avenue in Manhattan. The 10-year-olds of Class 5-313 write lots of compositions, and for their last assignment they assumed the role of animals reacting to the news of the imminent change in their environment. Although the new habitat will make life in the zoo much more civilized, frankly, not everyone in Class 5-313 is thrilled about the whole thing.

''ROAR,'' wrote Randi Schachter, taking the part of the lion. ''I like it here the way it is. So leave me alone and move everyone else!'' And for the parrots, wrote Gabriel Gross, the change would be nothing short of calamitous: There once was a parrot in a zoo. The birds' surroundings became new. The contrast made him sigh. Then what he did was die. And all of the parrot's friends did too. Of course, some of the animals viewed the change with equanimity. ''I was so excited!'' wrote Ryan Fitzpatrick as Horace the Hippo. However, it was up to Amy McGovern to give us the real zoo scoop. Here, in its entirety, is her composition, titled, ''An Exclusive Interview with The New York Times'': ''Mrs Antelope, what do you think about the changing of the zoo?'' the Rovin' Raven reporter asked. ''Well (sob) (gasp) I think it's a good idea but I don't wanna go (whine),'' she answered. ''Don't you wanna make friends and have your children grow up in a nice environment?'' Mr. Raven asked.''Of course, but I wanna live somewhere nice too. All day I cook and clean so when Mr. Antelope gets back he has a nice home. But no! I won't go!'' she screamed, bursting with anger. That's when the Rovin' Raven reporter ran out. His name should be the Rovin' Chicken reporter.'' STOP THE PRESSES DEPT.: Michael Winship was passing the stacks of newspapers for sale by the checkout counter in the Gristede's at Bleecker and Grove Streets when he noticed a handwritten sign. ''I imagine the manager must be a Mr. Whipple type, who frets about people squeezing the Charmin,'' says Mr. Winship. The sign says: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT TAKING THE TOP NEWSPAPER IS NOT HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH. CINQUAIN All the birds and bees are mating, Tattered torrid teens are dating, Herring are now marinating, Youngish hearts are palpitating, While my own is fibrillating! Recently in this space, Louis Phillips proposed that if the Knicks or the Rangers have the audacity to move out of New York, a new team should be named the Kismets, ''the New York City team that leaves its final standings up to fate.'' However, Margo Siegel of Manhattan disagrees. ''I think that after the Nets, Jets and Mets, New York's next team should be the Regrets,'' she says. ''That way, when they leave for greener pastures, we won't have any.'' REFLECTION ON WATCHING NUREYEV DANCE The best I do is plod While he leaps high - There but for the god Of grace go I. They are working on the road. Big wheeled yellow machines strip back the paving, and underneath, in rows, lie delicate old women in housecoats. They all have at least one of the features of my mother. Then some workmen come up into the room where I'm sitting. They walk around me over to the wall and start prying at it with crowbars. ''Got to keep at it once you've got the subconscious open,'' the foreman explains to me. A great deal of mortar and bricks clatters to the floor. Dust billows. The men pull objects out of the well and throw them back out of the way - tricycles, cribs, skates, furniture: all of it familiar to me from a long time ago. Peering over their shoulders I can see a scene faintly through the dust. A group of figures sits at a table: my family at a meal. It is all very pale and wobbly. The workmen reach their hands in, poke crowbars right through my father's face, through my brother's shoulder, through the back of a chair, through a bowl of potato salad. The people in the scene go on obliviously, mouthing animated silences. ''Well, that's going to be it for today,'' the foreman announces finally. He points to his wrist. ''Quitting time: got to go home and start the weekend!'' He grins and tips his hard hat and leads his crew out to the street. Their boots crunch in the rubble. I stand at the torn opening, looking at it. It's still much too faint, really; it goes in and out of its forms and I can't hear anything. The dust hurts my eyes and makes me cough. Finally I turn away and go out of the room, shutting the door behind me so the dust won't get into the rest of the house. I go outside and look around. The exposed roadway is covered with tarpaulins; from the edges, the multiple old women's feet stick out. Barricades have been set up to keep people away. I walk back inside slowly with my hands in my pockets. ''Well, there's not really much I can do,'' I think to myself. ''I'll just have to wait 'til they come back Monday.''

Translate \\"Hanson\\" to Finnish?","output":"Translating names or surnames from one language to another doesn't always have a direct equivalent, especially when it comes to languages with different alphabets and phonetic structures. \\"Hanson\\" is a name of Scandinavian origin, which makes it common in countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. It is formed with the prefix \\"Han-\\", which is a short form of \\"Johannes\\" (equivalent to \\"John\\" in English) and the suffix \\"-son,\\" which means \\"son of\\".  In Finnish, there is no direct translation for \\"Hanson\\" as a surname, as Finnish surnames typically have different endings and follow different conventions. However, if we were to consider the meaning and origin of the name, the closest equivalent in Finnish for the \\"Han-\\" prefix would be \\"Juhani\\" or \\"Johannes\\" (both Finnish variations of \\"John\\"). The Finnish language doesn't use the patronymic system (the practice of creating surnames based on the father's name with a suffix such as \\"-son\\" or \\"-sen\\") in the same way as Scandinavian languages, but it does have some surnames that reflect family relationships. For example, the Finnish surname \\"Heikkinen\\" is derived from the first name \\"Heikki,\\" meaning that someone with this surname could potentially be referred to as \\"Heikki's son\\" or \\"Heikki's descendant.\\" However, this is not an equivalent form to \\"-son\\" and is specific to Finnish surnames. In conclusion, there is no direct translation of the surname \\"Hanson\\" to Finnish, as the languages have different conventions and structures for surnames. However, you can understand the meaning and origin of the name in relation to the Finnish context by considering its connection to the first name variations \\"Juhani\\" or \\"Johannes.\\" Nonetheless, a person with the surname \\"Hanson\\" would likely keep their surname intact if they were living in or visiting Finland, as it's a proper noun that doesn't require translation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story of Lady Godiva’s naked ride through the streets of Coventry has been a cornerstone of British folklore for 1,000 years. But now a Belgian chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both her name and the famous image of her on top of a horse. The situation was exposed when lawyers acting for the confectionery giant fired a warning letter to a pub called The Lady Godiva last week, warning that it was infringing on its ‘intellectual property’. Owner Glen Simons was given a 90-day ultimatum to change his bar’s name and remove all references to the 11th Century noblewoman, whose daring protest at oppressive taxes has become the stuff of legend.

The World Bank wants the governments of poor countries to do more to improve their investment climates, action it described as central to economic growth and poverty reduction. What is a good title for this?","output":"\\"Strengthening Investment Climates in Developing Countries: The World Bank’s Strategy for Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction\\" In essence, the World Bank is urging the governments of economically-weaker countries to take significant measures to enhance their investment climates. Their rationale is that a better investment climate could encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to invest more in these countries, leading to economic growth. Better investment climates usually translate to improved infrastructure, stable political conditions, and efficient, transparent processes for starting and running businesses. Such conditions not only attract investments but also catalyze the creation of more jobs, thus helping to alleviate poverty by increasing household incomes. Moreover, higher investments lead to an increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consequently promoting economic growth. Additionally, this refers to improving basic services such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as enhancing the quality of institutions that support commerce, like the legal system enforcing contracts, property rights and commercial regulations. It also includes improving education, skill levels, and health of the employed population, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability. However, this target is not simple to achieve, as it requires considerable systematic changes, proper policy making, strategic planning, implementation techniques, and continuous assessment. It also needs the eradication of corruption, the establishment of a proper judicial system, and the promotion of good governance.  The World Bank is playing an instrumental role in this process, providing not just funds but also knowledge resources, technical skills, policy advice, and help in capacity building. They also stress on the importance of private sector participation, international trade, and enterprise development in creating a favourable investment climate. Therefore, addressing investment climates is at the heart of the World Bank's strategy. They see it as central to economic growth and poverty reduction. Their aim is not only to increase investments, but also to make sure that the increase leads to sustainable and inclusive growth that improves the lives of the citizens, especially the poor.  In this light, the push for better investment climates is a push for transformation. Hence, while it is a challenge for poor countries, it also presents an opportunity for them to break the poverty cycle and usher in unprecedented economic growth. It underscores that developing countries, with the necessary support and guidance, can create a thriving, conducive investment climate and leverage it for their economic and social advancement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, your question specifically asks for the team that represents the third major-professional ice hockey team in the city of Calgary, which is associated with Ranheim's career.  To answer this question, we must first identify the three major-professional ice hockey teams that have represented the city of Calgary. The city has had three teams playing at the highest level of professional hockey in their respective times: 1. Calgary Tigers (1920-1927): The Tigers played in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the Prairie Hockey League (PHL) during their existence, which predates the NHL. As Paul Ranheim hadn't been born yet, he never played for the Calgary Tigers. 2. Calgary Cowboys (1975-1977): The Cowboys were part of the World Hockey Association (WHA) which was a rival league to the NHL at the time. Since Paul Ranheim began his professional career in the late 1980s, he never played for this team either. 3. Calgary Flames (1980-present): The Calgary Flames are the current NHL team from the city of Calgary, which means they are the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city. Considering Paul Ranheim's playing history, he played for the Calgary Flames from the 1988 to 1994 season, becoming an important contributor to the team during his tenure. So, based on the information provided and reasoning, Paul Stephen Ranheim played for the Calgary Flames, which is the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary in the National Hockey League (NHL)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering  through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides  on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal  wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Question: Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because   _  .

The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\".

Wir hoffen, dass die Türkei diese Gelegenheit nutzen wird, um ihren europäischen Kurs zu bekräftigen, indem sie Herrn Denktash zu einem Kompromiss drängt. Translate to English","output":"We hope that Turkey will seize this opportunity to reaffirm its European course by urging Mr. Denktash to reach a compromise. In this statement, the speaker expresses the hope that Turkey will take advantage of the current situation to solidify its stance and commitment towards European integration. By doing so, Turkey is encouraged to exert pressure on Mr. Denktash (Rauf Denktash, a Turkish Cypriot politician), in order to achieve a compromise.  The European course mentioned in the statement might refer to Turkey's aspirations to join the European Union (EU) or to align itself more closely with European values and policies. It is important for Turkey to maintain a European focus, as it will help improve their image, strengthen diplomatic relations, and bring economic advantages if they eventually become a member of the EU. Rauf Denktash, a significant political figure in Northern Cyprus, could be involved in an issue that might impact Turkey's chances of achieving its European goals. By reaching a compromise, it would show that the country is willing to work with others in a constructive manner, which is a crucial aspect of European integration. For Turkey to successfully make use of this opportunity and to bolster its position on the path to becoming a European nation, it needs to adopt a few strategies. These may include: 1. Engaging in diplomatic efforts: Turkey should actively engage in diplomatic discussions, not only with Mr. Denktash but also with other EU member states, to build trust and demonstrate that they are ready to cooperate on various issues. 2. Addressing internal issues: In order to strengthen its European stance, Turkey needs to address internal issues such as human rights, freedom of speech, and the rule of law. Ensuring that these areas align with European values will be essential to increasing their chances of integration. 3. Economic reforms: Implementing economic reforms that adhere to EU guidelines will help improve Turkey's economy and foster better trade relations with European nations. This will contribute to a more cohesive relationship between Turkey and the EU. 4. Promoting cultural exchange: Encouraging cultural exchange between Turkey and European nations will help foster better understanding and appreciation of each other's customs and values, which can be crucial in bridging the gap between the two. By pursuing these strategies, Turkey will significantly improve its chances of strengthening its European course and achieving its long-term goals of integration. Getting Mr. Denktash to reach a compromise would be one essential step on this path, demonstrating Turkey's flexibility and commitment to working collaboratively on regional and international issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CLICK HERE to read Everton manager Roberto Martinez's comments after the game Ferocious in Europe, flimsy at home. If Everton’s progress in the Europa League has been without a hitch, uncertainty dogs their domestic form. A game at home to Hull City, in theory, should have been a straightforward opportunity for Roberto Martinez’s squad to make up lost ground in their pursuit of a top four spot. When Romelu Lukaku gave them a first-half lead, all seemed to be going to plan. Had this been a contest on a Thursday night, Everton would, in all likelihood, have motored away but there is something about the Barclays Premier League that means their footing is not so sure.","output":"As the game continued, it became apparent that the consistency of Everton's play in the Europa League was sorely missing. Hull City, though an underdog, seemed determined not to let the opportunity pass without putting up a fight. Their scrappy play and relentless high press unsettled Everton during the second half, and frustration quickly settled in among the home crowd. Despite several attempts to increase their lead, Everton's finishing lacked the precision necessary to translate chances into goals. The Hull City defenders, sensing the mounting pressure amongst their opponents, started playing with renewed vigor and conviction. Throughout the second half, they repeatedly thwarted Everton's attempts to extend their advantage by launching desperate blocks and timely interceptions. In the 78th minute, Hull City's persistence paid off. A corner kick taken by Hull resulted in a scrappy but decisive goal, leaving the Everton defense stunned and the match leveled at 1-1. As Hull City celebrated, the Everton players could only look on in dismay, questioning how they had allowed themselves to be pegged back while playing at home. Ultimately, the game ended in a 1-1 stalemate, dealing a significant blow to Everton's top-four aspirations. Disappointment was palpable amongst the players and supporters alike, as the home crowd filed out of the stadium. In his post-match comments, Manager Roberto Martinez lamented the lack of consistency between his team's European and domestic performances. Martinez vowed to address this gap and to ensure his team pushes on from the setback. He acknowledged the need for stronger mental fortitude in future domestic games and stressed the importance of not taking any opponent lightly. He also urged his players to remember that, despite their recent successes in the Europa League, they must also excel in the Barclays Premier League to truly consider themselves a top team. As the season continued, Everton would have highs, lows, and even more challenging obstacles to overcome. However, it would be that fateful draw against Hull City that served as a turning point for the squad. They would eventually improve their domestic performance and develop the confidence and consistency needed to challenge for the top four. Despite being seen as a missed opportunity, the game against Hull City became a lesson in humility and the importance of treating every game with the utmost seriousness. It would be this newfound knowledge and strengthened resilience that would see Everton's season ultimately end on a more positive note, with the team being heralded for their growth and determination in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: By 2050 there will have been an extra 2.5 billion people on earth. And what will they eat? To solve the problem, we should have to double our food production. We can also develop a diet of algae , insects and meat grown in laboratories. Algae can grow very quickly at sea, in polluted water and in places that would normally kill food crops. They are already eaten widely in Japan and China and they are eaten by almost everything from shrimps to blue whales. They can fix CO2 in the atmosphere and provide fats and sugars. Man-made meat looks like meat, feels like meat and it is meat, although it's never been from a living, breathing animal. Instead, it is grown from cells in big containers. Moreover, studies show that producing man-made meat will use far less water, energy and land. China has developed \\"green super rice\\", a series of rice types which produce more grain and have stronger ability to fight against floods, salty water, insects and disease. We used traditional plant breeding techniques to cross-breed more than 250 rice types. Green super rice, which is enough to feed an extra 100 million people, will be planted widely in the coming years. Insects like ants are not on most European menus but at least 1,400 kinds are eaten across Africa, Latin America and Asia. Now, with rising food prices and worldwide land shortages, such insects are getting more and more popular. Not only are many insects rich in protein , low in fat and high in Ca and Fe, but insect farms need little space. And they can grow well on paper, algae and industrial wastes. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: Green super rice is delicious but high in price. B: In Asia about 100 million people may be faced with food shortages. C: Man-made meat doesn't look like meat but has the same taste as real meat. D: One of the reasons why many people begin to eat insects is their rich food value.

The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head or not. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Problem:Head: PersonX beats PersonX's swords into ploughshares<sep>Tail: destructive Solution:","output":"Step 1: Understand the Head event In the Head event, \\"PersonX beats PersonX's swords into ploughshares\\", PersonX is transforming their swords into ploughshares (an agricultural tool). Step 2: Understand the Tail event The Tail event, \\"destructive,\\" describes something that causes damage or destruction. Step 3: Compare the Head and Tail events The Head event tells us that PersonX is making a change from weapons (swords) to tools for agriculture (ploughshares). This usually indicates a transition from violence or conflict towards peace and productivity. Step 4: Determine if the Tail event is PersonX's intention The Tail event, \\"destructive,\\" does not align with the intentions suggested by the Head event. Converting swords to ploughshares leans more towards peace and productivity, whereas the Tail event implies damage or destruction. Step 5: Provide the answer Based on the comparison between the Head and the Tail events, the Tail event does not appear to be the intention of PersonX. Solution: No"},{"instruction":"Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works. After the end of this story, he had probably:  A. Continued a bad medication regimen.  B. not enough information  C. Broke up with his girlfriend.  D. Posted more rants about his girlfriend. A:","output":"B. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","output":"The band Paramore released the song \\"Playing God\\" on their third studio album titled \\"Brand New Eyes.\\" This album was released through Fueled by Ramen on September 29, 2009. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" showcased a more mature sound for the band, both lyrically and musically, and it received critical acclaim upon its release. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and included other popular singles such as \\"Ignorance,\\" \\"Brick by Boring Brick,\\" and \\"The Only Exception.\\" \\"Playing God\\" is the fifth track on the album and it deals with themes of hypocrisy and judgment. The song's lyrics focus on the idea of someone taking on a self-righteous role and assuming authority over another person's life, much like 'playing god.' Lead singer Hayley Williams co-wrote the song with guitarists Josh Farro and Taylor York. The music video for \\"Playing God\\" was released on November 15, 2010, and was directed by Brandon Chesbro. The video features a darker and more theatrical visual aesthetic, which matches the song's powerful message. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" represented a turning point for Paramore, as internal conflicts within the band began to surface during its creation. Eventually, these conflicts led to the departure of two founding members, Josh and Zac Farro, in December 2010. Despite these struggles, \\"Brand New Eyes\\" remains an essential album in Paramore's discography, showcasing their musical growth, and \\"Playing God\\" stands as a powerful testament to the band's ability to address complex themes through their music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. Once you create a question you also need to provide the correct answer for it.

The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Create questions that result in factoid answers.  A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. Input: The central and pretty much only plot revolves around students at a college campus who are involved in a role-playing game called TAG which is an acronym for \\"The Assassination Game\\". The game is fairly straightforward, each player is assigned another player who they must assassinate by shooting him or her with a spring loaded dart gun. At the outset of the game each player is given a document called a Tag Victim Profile that contains a photo, the name, address, phone and class schedule of the player who he/she must kill. After a player completes the assignment he/she then takes over the assignment of the person who he/she killed and then notifies the game organizer, Nick Carpenter, of the kill so he can plot the kill on his game progress chart. Play continues in this manner until only one player remains at which point he or she is declared the winner.The movie follows the exploits of 2 TAG players, Susan Swayze who is playing for the first time and Loren Gersh who is the 5 time undefeated TAG champion looking to repeat yet again. He doesn't have much of a life besides playing TAG and devotes all his time to following players around and taking them out. At least one of these two characters is in every scene except for a few isolated occasions where the camera is concentrating on Alex Marsh. The only time other TAG players are shown is when they are interacting with Susan or Gersh.The movie opens with Gersh standing in a dorm hallway wearing a Get Smart style hat and trench coat while hiding behind a newspaper with eye holes cut out. His target approaches but then the target sees him and slowly backs away as he draws his dart gun but for some reason he is carrying an empty gun. When his target realizes he has no darts he turns and runs away as Gersh casually strolls after him Pepe' le Pew fashion. The target goes down a set of stairs and hides under a grate. On the sidewalk above footsteps are heard approaching and then leaving. Suddenly Gersh appears out of the dark, greets him, loads his dart gun and fires. The dart sticks to the forehead of the target and he then utters an expletive as he pulls it off.The next scene features Susan walking outside of a dorm as the clock tower strikes 9pm. While she is looking at the profile of her target, Shooster, she notices a car signaling somone in a dorm room by flashing its headlights then the person in dorm room responds by turning the room lights on and off. In the meantime someone else is in a phone booth in front of the dorm and says, \\"she's right here I can't talk\\". Susan brushes the signaling off and enters the dorm anyway. Shooster makes sure that Susan sees him then walks down the stairs to the laundry room with a laundry basket in his hands. She follows him and enters the laundry room but it appears to be empty. She doesn't see that he is hiding in a dark corner behind a dryer. As she is about to leave she hears him move and opens a washing machine door just in time for it to block a dart that was headed for her. They proceed to shoot at one another until she can't find another dart at which point she runs away. He finds a dart, loads his gun and follows. To escape Susan ducks into Alex Marsh's dorm room to hide. Alex tries to talk to her but she shushes him. Susan leaves almost as abruptly as she entered. Alex gets out of bed and opens his door to see where she went. Susan walks down the hall as Shooster and Charlie, another player, suddenly pop out of different doors with Susan in the middle of them. As they fire Alex tells Susan to look out, she ducks and they end up shooting one another instead. The three players walk away together laughing as Alex stands speechless in his underwear. Alex finds Susan extremely attractive so he is determined to find her to try to get to know her. Alex writes for the school paper and plans to use the pretext of writing an article about TAG to meet Susan and follow her around. He visits the office of Nick Carpenter, the game organizer, locates Susan's file and discovers where she lives.Susan's roomate Nancy is also playing TAG and in fact it is made clear later that she is the one who got Susan involved in the game. Nancy and Susan realize they are being followed by Nancy's assassin, Randy, so Nancy decides to use a trick to get rid of him. Susan observes while Nancy goes to the pool, changes into her bathing suit, hides a mini-dart gun in her bikini bottom and then pretends to drown in the pool. Randy jumps in with his clothes on to save her but after he lifts her out of the pool she shoots him with a dart.In the meantime another TAG player, Swanson, is heading to the bathroom to take a shower. He has his dart gun with him and places it on the soap dish in the shower stall. Gersh is hiding in a stall with his feet on the toilet so that Swanson doesn't know he is in the bathroom. Gersh opens the shower curtain and while lecturing him about not being careful enough, Swanson knocks his dart gun on the floor. The gun hits the floor, fires and the dart hits Gersh. Gersh is extremely upset at being hit for the first time and protests that it doesn't count because it was an accident. He then unsuccessfully tries to bribe Swanson to start over as if nothing had happened. To preventSwanson from reporting him dead to Carpenter, he retrieves a real Beretta 92 from his dorm room, returns to the shower and murders him. He then uses a laundry cart to wheel the corpse to his dorm room closet.Alex goes to visit Susan and tells her that he is writing an article about TAG and needs to follow a player around in order to learn about the game. Susan agrees to let him accompany her only if he helps her win, he agrees and she gives him his first assignment, to go warm up her car. In the meantime, after contemplating his actions, Gersh is somewhat depressed and calls Carpenter to tell him he killed Swanson as if asking for guidance. Carpenter doesn't realize he means he killed Swanson for real, he thinks he meant he shot him with a dart. So Carpenter notes the kill on his progress chart and tells Gersh to keep up the good work. Carpenter's encouragement cheers Gersh up and at that point the limited remaining grasp he had on reality vanishes. Though he has no need to use the real Beretta to silence anyone else, he proceeds to use it to murder the remaining contestants unlucky enough to become one of his assigned kills and also dumps their bodies in his closet.Next Alex starts Susan's car as some girls, who are obviously out to get Susan, are snickering in the background. Susan yells for him to drive and pick her up. As he does the girls come out of the dark giving chase on foot but the car pulls away too fast for them to get a shot off. Susan has Alex park in the Delta House fraternity lot next to the car of her target. Alex questions Susan while they wait for her target to come out. Susan loses track of time and realizes he closed his room light and is approaching. She kisses Alex just as her victim reaches her car with his gun drawn. He figures they are just making out so he turns around to get in his car. Susan then shoots him in the back through her window which was rolled down.In the next scene Nancy and Susan are in class. Nancy tells Susan she is dating Randy and that she is not playing TAG anymore because instead she going to Randy's track practice then she is going away with Randy to his Parent's beach house and the following day to a concert together. Gersh is seen in the widow spying on them. It shortly becomes clear that Nancy is the one he is targeting. He tails her to the track meet and sneaks under the bleachers right behind her. Gersh shoots and kills her at the same exact time the coach fires a blank to start the race. Gersh then reports the kill to Carpenter and transports her body to his room.Frank, who is apparently an editor at the school paper, approaches Alex and tells him that there are two missing students and tries to convince him to write an article about it but Alex tells him he is still busy with his TAG feature. At first blush it appears that the second missing student was Nancy. However, it is implied that both are males because not even their \\"girlfriends\\" know where they are and is later revealed that this second missing student was a different TAG player who Gersh killed. The second kill was never shown on film nor does Gersh report it to Carpenter anywhere in the movie, which would have cleared things up sooner. Thus the audience is not aware of it and most assume the report was referring to Nancy. This makes one wonder why Susan is not worried. Randy eventually reports Nancy missing towards the end of the movie and since Nancy told her that she was going away Susan never suspects anything is wrong by her absence.Alex goes to meet Susan but can't find her at first. Susan calls the Campus Information desk and asks to speak to Alex. She tells him that she is hiding in the nearby phone booth and needs his help because she is out of darts and her assigned assassin, Wallace, is waiting outside the phone booth to get her. He makes an announcement over the loudspeaker that there is a free concert in a different hall and a large crowd including Wallace run to the location of the alleged concert. This permits Susan to escape and they spend the day together.Later that evening while Susan and Alex are spying on Gowdy, her assigned target, she notices that Wallace is again tracking her. She tells Marsh to keep an eye on Gowdy while she goes off to get rid of Wallace. She goes to the pool locker room and changes into her bathing suit, planning to try the same drowning trick that Nancy demonstrated to her. In the meantime Alex sees Gersh lurking about and asks him if he is looking for Wallace. Gersh answers yes and Alex tells him to go to the pool to find him. While Susan is under the water Gersh shoots and kills Wallace. Susan exits the pool perplexed and while searching for Wallace encounters Alex who tells her he took care of Wallace but lost Gowdy. They run to the athletic building and again part company as she says she will take the front and he should take the back.While lying in wait Susan shoots Alex as he walks through the door thinking he is Gowdy. Alex then proceeds to step on the dart breaking it. Susan states that she had only one dart for her mini dart gun and asks Alex to go back to her locker to get her primary weapon while she spies on Gowdy. Gowdy returns and starts searching rooms, the last room is where Susan is hiding. Alex is unable to remember the locker combination and thus fails to get her gun. He sees Gersh and runs up to him and asks if he got Wallace. Then he said he did Gersh a favor and in return wants to borrow Gersh's gun. Gersh gives him the dart gun and Alex tosses it to Susan just in time for her to shoot Gowdy before he found her. Naturally the final two players left at this point are Gersh and Susan.Game rules dictate that a party be held before the final round between the two remaining players can commence so a party is scheduled the next evening and play is suspended for a 21 hour period until after the party ends. Susan and Alex use the break to spend the night together in her room. Alex leaves in the morning but proceeds to smother her throughout the day with flowers and notes professing his love. Susan is put off and tries to avoid him and refuses to answer her phone. When he approaches her at the party she tells him she needs space and is not sure when and if she wants to see him again. She tells him that she wants to handle the final round on her own rather than with his help, despite telling him the previous night that she wanted his help.After the party the final round commences. At 9pm Gersh calls Susan and challenges her to meet him in the quad. During the course of playing cat and mouse Susan hides in Gersh's room to try a sneak attack when he returns but she finds the corpses in the closet and runs away screaming in panic. Interestingly only 3 bodies are shown, Nancy, Swanson and Wallace, despite the fact it is later implied that he murdered 5. Gersh sees her running from his room and tries to get her before she can tell anyone. She runs screaming to the College rent-a-cop but as he loads a round into his revolver Gersh shoots and kills him. He proceeds to chase her to the roof of a building.In the meantime Alex drowns his sorrows with journalistic work, specifically investigating the rash of missing college students. He visits campus security as Randy is reporting Nancy missing. At this point it becomes clear that Nancy was not the second missing student, another player was. Apparently 2 players never shown in the film were killed offscreen, one named M. Homes and the other we are simply given the last name March. Alex recognizes Wallace and pieces together that all the missing students played TAG and were taken out by Gersh. He surmises that Gersh harmed them for real and then sets out in search of Susan to warn her. Alex finds the dead security guard and picks up the gun not realizing there was only 1 round in it. Then he hears the sound of glass breaking coming from the rooftop and runs to investigate. Gersh is about to shoot Susan when Alex appears. Alex fires at Gersh but nothing happens and then fires 4 more times to no avail. Gersh is amused by this and at first simply laughs but after the 5th click he takes aim at Alex. Alex pulls the trigger one final time and at last a bullet fires hitting Gersh who then falls off the roof to his death. The movie ends with Alex consoling Susan.

Kelis Rogers was born and raised in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in the Frederick Douglass Houses. Her first name is a portmanteau of her father's name, Kenneth (1944-2000), and her mother's name, Eveliss. Her father Kenneth was an African American jazz musician and Pentecostal minister, and was formerly a professor at Wesleyan University. Her mother Eveliss is a Chinese-Puerto Rican fashion designer who inspired Kelis to pursue her singing career. Kelis began recording her debut album, Kaleidoscope, in mid-1998 and was finished within a year. Produced by The Neptunes and released by Virgin Records in 1999, the album peaked at number 144 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and reached the top five on the Top Heatseekers chart. As of 2006, the album had sold 249,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Its lead and most notable single, \\"Caught Out There\\", became a top ten Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs hit and peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. During this time, Kelis featured on Ol' Dirty Bastard's U.S. top 40 single \\"Got Your Money\\".  The album performed better in Europe, where \\"Caught out There\\" was a moderate hit and reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart. A second single, \\"Good Stuff\\" (featuring Terrar of Clipse), reached number 19; the third, \\"Get Along with You\\", was less successful, reaching number 51. The British Phonographic Industry certified Kaleidoscope gold for sales of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart.  In 2001, Kelis won the BRIT Award for International Breakthrough Act and the NME Award for Best R&B/Soul Act, before joining Moby and U2 on their Area:One and Elevation tours, respectively. Kelis and the Neptunes' output at this time was heralded as foreshadowing an innovation in contemporary R&B, but she later said, \\"I was never an R&B artist. People coined me one but that's because, especially if you're in the States, if you're black and you sing, then you're R&B\\". Her colorful style in both clothing and hair received considerable attention.  Kelis's second album, Wanderland, was released in 2001 in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, but did not receive a North American release. According to Kelis, her U.S. record company at the time, Virgin, had laid off those that worked on Kaleidoscope; their replacements did not understand or believe in Wanderland, which led her to leave the label around the time of the album's European release. A commercial failure, Wanderland peaked at number 78 in the UK, although its sole single release, \\"Young, Fresh n' New\\", was a top forty entry on the UK Singles Chart. The album, which was produced in its entirety by the Neptunes and features collaborations with members of Clipse and No Doubt, was well received by publications such as The Guardian and NME.  In 2002, Kelis recorded \\"So Be It\\" for the Red Hot Organization's Fela Kuti tribute CD, Red Hot and Riot, from which all proceeds were donated to AIDS awareness charities. The same year, she had a top 20 US club hit with a remix of \\"Young, Fresh 'n' New\\" remix produced by Timo Maas, who subsequently featured Kelis on his single \\"Help Me\\". Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did she have any other albums reach the charts?","output":"Yes, Kelis had other albums reach the charts. For instance, her debut album, Kaleidoscope, peaked at number 144 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and reached the top five on the Top Heatseekers chart.

Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job. Myth 2: Always please the interviewer Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile. Myth 3: Try to control the interview Nobody \\"controls\\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview. Myth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer Study the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change.

Determine the sentiment: I consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown more \\"humanized\\". One of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?","output":"The sentiment in the text can be characterized as mostly positive, with some neutral observations and a hint of initial reluctance. The author expresses their admiration for the movie, considering it a \\"masterpiece,\\" and shares how their appreciation grew upon watching it multiple times. They find the unconventional portrayal of German soldiers and the Nazi government as more \\"humanized\\" in the film to be refreshing and unique compared to typical Hollywood movies. The attention to details in the movie is another aspect that the author appreciates, highlighting the inclusion of a historical murder in the plot and the symbolism of doors in the film. The author seems genuinely intrigued by the director, Fassbinder's, technique and seeks to engage other viewers in these observations. However, the author does admit to some indecision and initial difficulty in recognizing the movie's worth, as it took several viewings for them to fully appreciate its greatness. This admission can be seen as a touch of neutrality, as it neither praises nor criticizes the film directly but indicates the complexity of the movie's meaning and the viewer's response.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.  - Pierre Antoine Marie Chevalier ( born 8 October 1952 ) is a Belgian politician and member of the Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten ( VLD ) . He is a former Secretary of State in the Belgian Federal Government and was elected to the Belgian Senate in 2003 by the Dutch electoral college . He is also a freemason . He studied Laws and Criminology at the University of Ghent before he became a lawyer . He became involved in politics early on , first as a Trotskyist , as a socialist later on , and since 1992 as a liberal . In October 2000 , he was forced to resign as Secretary of State by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt , who is also a member of the VLD , after it became public that he had been named in a criminal investigation in Switzerland .  - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World).  - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.  - A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions who works at higher levels of court. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\".  - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.  - Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats ('), commonly known as Open Vld or simply as the VLD, is a liberal and conservative-liberal Flemish political party in Belgium. The party was created in 1992 from the former Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV) and politicians from other parties. The party led the government for three cabinets under Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 until March 2008. Open VLD most recently formed the Federal Government (the so-called \\"Swedish government\\") with N-VA, CD&V and the Francophone Reformist Movement (MR).  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons.  - The Party for Freedom and Progress ( PVV-PLP) was a liberal political party in Belgium which existed from 1961 until 1992. The party was the successor of the Liberal Party, which had roots dating back to 1846. It was succeeded in Flanders by the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) and in Wallonia by the Liberal Reformist Party, \\"Parti des Réformes et des Libertés de Wallonie\\" and the current-day Reformist Movement. In the German-speaking Community, it still exists as the Party for Freedom and Progress.  - A solicitor is a legal practitioner who traditionally deals with most of the legal matters in some jurisdictions. A person must have legally-defined qualifications, which vary from one jurisdiction to another, to be described as a solicitor and enabled to practise there as such. For example, in England and Wales a solicitor is admitted to practise under the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974. With some exceptions, practising solicitors must possess a practising certificate. There are many more solicitors than barristers in England; they undertake the general aspects of giving legal advice and conducting legal proceedings.  - The Dioxin Affair was a political crisis that struck in Belgium during the spring of 1999. Contamination of feedstock with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) was detected in animal food products, mainly eggs and chickens. Although health inspectors reported the problem in January, measurements were taken only from May 1999 when the media revealed the case. The then Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) opposition leader Guy Verhofstadt claimed that the government was trying to cover up the so-called \\"nota Destickere\\", which proved that several secretaries of state were informed much earlier that the food contained PCBs and dioxins.  - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - Guy Maurice Marie Louise Verhofstadt (born 11 April 1953) is a Belgian politician, who served as the 47th Prime Minister of Belgium from 1999 to 2008. Defeating the Socialists and Christian Democrats in the aftermath of the Agusta scandal and Dioxin Affair, he was the first liberal Prime Minister in Belgium since 1884.  - A counsel or a counsellor at law is a person who gives advice and deals with various issues, particularly in legal matters. It is a title often used interchangeably with the title of \\"lawyer\\".    What entity does 'pierre chevalier ' has the relation 'country of citizenship' with?

Answer the following question: Martin is moving and he needs to make a ramp so he can load heavy furniture into his truck. He has a bad back, so he wants to use the least effort possible. Before he cuts the wood, he is trying to decide how long the ramp should be so he can move the heavy furniture easily.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Should martin build a long or short ramp?  Hint: For an inclined plane, the input distance is the length of the sloping surface, and the output distance is the maximum height of the inclined plane. This was illustrated in Figure above . Because the sloping surface is always greater than the height of the inclined plane, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is always greater than 1. An inclined plane with a longer sloping surface relative to its height has a gentler slope. An inclined plane with a gentler slope has a greater mechanical advantage and requires less input force to move an object to a higher elevation. Answer:","output":"Martin should build a long ramp. A longer ramp will have a gentler slope, which will provide a greater mechanical advantage and require less input force to move the heavy furniture to a higher elevation. This will make it easier to load the furniture into the truck and put less strain on his back."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: To determine if an avocado is ripe for eating, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPTIONS: (1). pop the stem off and ensure the texture is slimy and color is brown. (2). pop the stem off of the top and make sure there is a green color....I think the answer is","output":"The more reasonable method to determine if an avocado is ripe for eating among the options provided is: Option (2): Pop the stem off of the top and make sure there is a green color. This method is considered more reasonable because it involves observing the color beneath the small stem, which is a good indicator of the avocado's ripeness. A green color beneath the stem generally means that the avocado is ripe and ready to eat. In contrast, a brown color may suggest that the avocado is overripe and the flesh inside could be potentially spoiled or have an unpleasant texture. Option (1) is not a recommended method to assess ripeness, as a slimy texture and brown color may be associated with spoilage and overripeness, rather than the ideal stage for consumption. Besides the method mentioned in option (2), there are other ways to check for avocado ripeness that can give you a more comprehensive understanding of its readiness for consumption: 1. Gentle pressure test: Hold the avocado in the palm of your hand and gently squeeze without using your fingertips, as this may cause bruising. A ripe avocado should yield to gentle pressure, feeling slightly soft but not mushy. 2. Skin texture: A ripe avocado usually has a slightly bumpy texture, which is typical for Hass avocados. Green-skinned varieties may be more challenging to judge by the skin texture alone, so gentle pressure and color remain better indicators for these varieties. 3. Color: For Hass avocados, as they ripen, their skin color changes from green to a darker, almost blackish hue. However, note that color alone may not be a foolproof indicator, as some avocados may turn darker but still be unripe. So, it's best to use color as a secondary factor along with the gentle pressure test. For other avocado varieties, color changes might be less dramatic, so get familiar with the specific variety you have to accurately determine ripeness. Combining these methods, it becomes easier to determine the ripeness of your avocado and enjoy its delicious, creamy flavor when it is at its best."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hill village situated 10 miles to the south, left their swamps untouched.  Which village took a less protective approach towards the environment?  Hint: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation. The answer is:","output":"Timber village took a less protective approach towards the environment.  This is because they initiated a channelization process which involved draining all the swamps near their village. Channelization as explained in the hint provided has negative effects on the environment, resulting in the loss of crucial habitats for hundreds of thousands of wetland species. These species then experience significant population declines as their habitats become increasingly fragmented and destroyed. This process contributes to environmental degradation and negatively impacts biodiversity. In contrast, Hill village situated 10 miles to the south, chose to leave their swamps untouched. By doing so, they allowed the natural ecosystem to continue supporting the various wetland species, maintaining the delicate balance in the environment, and enhancing biodiversity. Allowing the swamps to remain intact not only supports the natural ecosystem but also provides multiple ecosystem services such as water filtration, flood control, and carbon sequestration. The twentieth century saw a decline in waterfowl species' numbers, and while market hunting within the Central Flyway contributed to this decline, the most significant factor was the loss of breeding habitat due to the expansion of agricultural lands. Early maps of midwestern states show lakes and marshes that are either non-existent or significantly reduced in area today, signifying the extent to which these habitats have been lost. Channelization, which is the process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, has also played a significant role in this habitat degradation. Thus, Timber village's channelization process will likely further contribute to ecological harm. In conclusion, Timber village took a less protective approach towards the environment by implementing channelization and draining their swamps, as compared to Hill village, which left their swamps intact. The habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity associated with channelization and swamp drainage make Timber village's approach less ecologically sustainable and less protective of the environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, when he realizes that she had been hiding vital information, Ka-kui calls for backup and she is later arrested. However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), a Chinese American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Ka-kui follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, the CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Ka-kui finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by unknown forces, Ka-kui loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters. When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov (Yuri Petrov) who explains the situation. Ka-kui goes with the FSB and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is taken by a Russian submarine to Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's younger sister Annie (Wu Chen-chun) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss, is seriously ill and Ka-kui suspects the criminal will show up soon.

The £100 (160) Pikon is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much, according to its designers. And with plans available to download online, anyone can create the telescope themselves – as long as they own a 3D printer which costs at least £400 (650). Incredible images showing the surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with a 3D printed telescope. Physicist Mark Wrigley, one of Pikon's creator, said he believed the telescope would be a 'game changer,' making telescopes available to the general public. Pikon uses a £25 (40) Raspberry Pi camera module and is based on Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope design. The design involves placing a concave mirror to form an image of whatever the telescope is focused on directly onto the Pi camera sensor. The camera is mounted onto components created by 3D printing and, due to its small size, can sit directly in front of the mirror. The telescope has a magnification of times 160, which means that on a cloudless night it will be capable of detailed lunar observation as well as galaxies, star clusters and some planetary observation. £100 (160) Pikon is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much.

A SpaceX cargo ship rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday, carrying the first 3D printer for astronauts in orbit. Dragon should reach the space station Tuesday. It's the fifth station shipment for the California-based SpaceX. The space station-bound 3D printer was developed by Made in Space, another California company. It's sturdier than Earthly models to withstand the stresses of launch, and meets Nasa's strict safety standards. The space agency envisions astronauts one day cranking out spare parts as needed. For now, it's a technology demonstrator, with a bigger and better model to follow next year. The physicists unveiled the ambitious project, called Disruptive Technology Astronomy, as part of the University of Sheffield's Festival of the Mind.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?

What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"George W. De Long"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"To determine if the provided answer is correct, I will do some research on the topic. Step 1: Research the definition of middle class in the US I will look up trusted sources to find a definition and statistics on the middle class in the United States. Step 2: Comparing the found information with the answer provided I will compare the information I have gathered with the provided answer. Step 3: Determine if the answer is correct based on the gathered information. According to the information I found from a Pew Research Center report, the middle class in the United States is defined as adults whose annual household income is two-thirds to double the national median income, adjusted for household size. In 2021, this range for a household of three was 48,380 to 145,141 in annual income. Based on this definition, the percentage of households falling within the middle-class range varies. However, a 2020 report from the Pew Research Center indicates that in 2018, 51% of American adults lived in middle-class households. Considering this, the provided answer (25% to 66% of households) is not entirely accurate, as the information I gathered indicates it's approximately 51%."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.  Paragraph: Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease.

Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates. Washington (CNN)Few White House hopefuls would ever want to be compared to former President Richard Nixon, but some of Hillary Clinton's pre-campaign moves -- or lack thereof -- are reminiscent of the 37th president. As Clinton eyes another run at the presidency in 2016, some close to her -- especially those who are cheering reports she may wait until summer to officially announce a bid -- point to Nixon's successful 1968 presidential bid as a positive sign, particularly how Nixon's public operation went dark for about six months before entering the race. Despite being the presumed Democratic front-runner since Obama was reelected in 2012, Clinton has been largely absent from the public spotlight since the midterms wrapped in November 2014. And with the exception of the occasional paid speech and non-profit event, she could lie-low through the spring, a months-long hiatus similar to one Nixon took more than fifty years ago before winning the presidency for the first time.

I also found myself getting annoyed because no matter how bright they may be, 13 year olds aren't nearly as insightful and philosphical as Anna was. And to be quite honest, neither are most adults! And that lack of authenticity made the entire story implausible.

It's such a nice, crisp, earthy smell. My partner asked me what the smell was, and when I said \\"Dirt\\" he yelled out \\"It really does smell like dirt!\\" You might think that would be a bad thing, but it truly is quite amazing. The only con is that it wears VERY close to the skin. After about 30 min or so you don't really smell it unless you put your nose directly to where it was sprayed. However, it is a huge bottle, so spraying it multiple times throughout the day will barely put a dent in it. I have smelled a few other Demeter fragrances, and this one really stands out. Answer:","output":"There is a generally positive tone to this product review.  Step 1: Read the title of the review, which is \\"Wow.\\" The title suggests a sense of amazement or excitement, which can imply a positive tone. Step 2: Analyze the reviewer's experience with the product. The reviewer mentions falling in love with the scent immediately, which indicates a positive response.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass.  I am facing a new situation today: In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample would have lower pH value, sample A or sample B? A:","output":"Based on the background knowledge provided, a solution with a higher concentration of hydronium ions has a lower pH value, indicating it is more acidic. In the situation with David's chemistry lab, he has three samples - sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid, sample B is a weak acid, and sample C is not an acid.  Comparing sample A and sample B, it is essential to understand the difference between strong and weak acids. Strong acids are those that ionize almost completely in water, releasing a large quantity of hydronium ions. This results in a high concentration of hydronium ions in the solution, and thus a lower pH value. On the other hand, weak acids only partially ionize in water, releasing a smaller quantity of hydronium ions. Consequently, the concentration of hydronium ions is lower in a weak acid's solution, and its pH value is comparatively higher than that of a strong acid. In David's situation, since sample A is a strong acid and sample B is a weak acid, sample A will have a higher concentration of hydronium ions in the solution, thereby resulting in a lower pH value as compared to sample B. Thus, the correct answer to the question \\"Which sample would have a lower pH value, sample A or sample B?\\" is sample A, as it is a strong acid and more acidic than sample B, the weak acid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor. The answer is:","output":"The missing first step in the given process is the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil by the plant roots. In order to fully understand and contextualize this step, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the entire process, which is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a vital process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria, enabling these organisms to create food and energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The overall process can be broken down into several stages and steps, as follows: 1. Absorption of water and nutrients from the soil by the plant roots: This is the missing first step in the given process. Plant roots are responsible for absorbing water and essential minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, from the soil. Root hairs are specialized structures that increase the surface area in contact with the soil, enhancing absorption capabilities. The absorbed water and nutrients are then transported to other parts of the plant, including the leaves, through specialized tissues called xylem. 2. Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem: Water and nutrients absorbed by the roots are transported to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem. This upward movement is facilitated by processes such as capillary action, root pressure, and transpiration pull, ensuring that water reaches the leaves where it will be utilized in photosynthesis. 3. Energy is harvested through the light reaction: In the chlorophyll-containing cells of the plant leaves, light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy through a series of complex reactions known as the light-dependent reactions, or light reactions. Here, light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen (O2), protons (H+), and electrons. This process generates oxygen and high energy compounds such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which will be used to fuel other reactions in the plant. 4. Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar: After the light reactions, the plant moves to the next stage of photosynthesis known as the Calvin cycle or light-independent reactions. Here, carbon dioxide is combined with the energy from ATP and the electrons from NADPH to form glucose and other organic molecules, which serve as the building blocks for various cellular structures and functions. 5. Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion: The oxygen produced during the light reaction is no longer needed by the plant and is released into the atmosphere through specialized openings called stomata found on the leaf's surface. The stomata facilitate gas exchange by permitting the entry of carbon dioxide and the exit of oxygen and water vapor. 6. The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor: The water produced during the photosynthesis process can be reused by the plant as needed, or it can be released back into the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. This release of water vapor through the stomata aids in maintaining a proper balance of water and minerals within the plant, as well as regulating temperature and pulling more water up from the roots. In summary, the missing first step of the process is the absorption of water and nutrients by the plant roots from the soil. This water, along with the absorbed nutrients, will then be transported and utilized by the plant in various stages of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to the production of energy and essential molecules required for growth, reproduction, and maintenance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – It's a race that's both the most expensive one for a House seat in history and down to the wire: Voters in Georgia will decide on Tuesday whether Democrat Jon Ossoff or Republican Karen Handel will fill a congressional seat for suburban Atlanta. It's incredibly tight, and with hours to go the parties and some super PACs are doing what they can to give their candidate an edge—not all so successfully. President Trump gave Handel a boost on Twitter Monday morning, tweeting, \\"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P's [premiums]. Vote now for Karen H.\\" Cue the analyses of a tweet.

Choose which camera you would like to use be it your computer webcam, cell phone, film/digital camera, or disposable camera.  If you do not have any of these, go to your nearest electronics store and ask an employee which camera would work best for you. If you are low on cash, buy a disposable camera from places like grocery stores or gas stations. Otherwise, ask a friend if you can use their camera. Decide whether you want a “mug shot” or full-length photo. Facebook profile pictures are small sized, so having either a head shot would be best. If you love your shape, try a pose to the waist. Selfies are self-portraits generally taken by a digital camera or camera phone supported by your hand or “selfie stick”. Taking selfies enable you to have more control over how others see you.  For most people, the best angle for a selfie is one that's slightly higher than their line of vision. And you probably shouldn't stare directly into the camera, either. Most people don’t look their best straight on, so angle your face using your “good side”.   Selfie sticks are monopods that help you take selfies beyond the range of your hand. Otherwise, elongate your arm and snap a photo of yourself. If you are using a smart phone, flip your phone so you can see your image in the screen. You can position the image exactly as you please and snap a photo  Try to keep your arm out of the frame. most phone cameras are higher quality on the back of the phone (not in forward facing mode), so it may be better to have someone take you picture for you, even if it's selfie-style.   If you don’t have a smart phone or you are using a camera, find a mirror so you can still see your image. If there is no mirror accessible, angle it toward you as best you can. Most selfie sticks come with mirrors. Find a friend or someone nearby to take a photo of you. Make sure your photographer knows how to focus the camera to avoid blurriness and pixelation. Generally cameras have a little box that pops up when looking through/at the screen. Have them center you in this box and snap the photo. This is the easiest way to center and focus the photo.  If the box does not show up automatically, there should be an option in the settings or directions of the camera to show you how to make it appear. To spice up the image, have your photographer zoom in all the way, step back until your image clearly fills the frame (with space around all sides), and snap the photo. Make sure the flash is off to avoid harsh light. Having a timer will enable you to position yourself in the ideal way. Ask your photographer to give you a countdown, or give yourself a countdown. If you are taking a selfie, rest the camera on a stable surface, set the timer, and get into position. Read the directions that come with your camera on how to set a timer. If you lost the hard copy of the directions, a google search should prove fruitful. By taking a lot of photos you have a larger selection to choose from. The first couple snapshots may not turn out the way you envisioned, so take a lot and pick the one you like the best. Throughout the photo-shoot, periodically look at the photos you have taken. This way you can judge what you need to change in order to take an amazing picture. For example, you may need to change locations, switch up your posture, or fix your hair.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the story that is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. No American family embodies mainstream Republicanism more than the Bushes, noted a New York Times article this year. For three generations, Bush men have occupied towering positions in the party pantheon, and the party's demographic and ideological shifts can be traced through the branches of the Bush family tree: from Prescott, the blue-blooded Eisenhower Republican, and George H.W. Bush, the transitional figure who tried and failed to emulate the approach of the New Right, to George W. Bush, who embodied the new breed of tax-cutting, evangelical conservatism. Indeed, the Bushes' metamorphosis from genial centrism to deep-fried conservatism has both anticipated and reflected the party's trajectory. But now, Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, seems to be bucking the trend. He is seeking to return the party to its ideological moorings -- toward the centrism of his grandfather. Even before the GOP's ignominious defeat in November, Jeb was offering tough love to his party, suggesting that Republicans stand up to Grover Norquist and craft a bipartisan compromise to reduce the deficit significantly. But will Republicans listen? There are many reasons to believe they won't. Prescott was a Manhattan investment banker who called himself a \\"moderate progressive.\\" In the 1952 primary between conservative presidential candidate Sen. Robert Taft and moderate Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Prescott chose Eisenhower -- and became the president's favorite golf partner. Prescott rode Eisenhower's coattails into the Senate, where he focused on urban renewal, spearheading the 1954 Housing Act. An early proponent of the line-item veto, he received national recognition as an advocate of fiscal responsibility. Prescott's son George H.W. left for West Texas in 1948 when Texas was still a one-party state. But change was afoot in the South, and by the time H.W. ran for U.S. Senate in 1964, he encountered a flourishing Texas Republican Party that had recently elected its first U.S. senator by attracting hordes of conservative Democrats. But the new rank-and-file Republicans were nothing like the Connecticut Republicans he knew -- or even like those in the Houston suburbs. Biographer Richard Ben Cramer imagined H.W.'s vexation at this new breed of Texas Republican:. \\"These ... these nuts! They were coming out of the woodwork! They talked about blowing up the U.N., about armed revolt against the income tax. ...The nuts hated him. They could smell Yale on him.\\" Recognizing that his 1964 primary campaign would need to be more Goldwater than Rockefeller, he ignored the social problems Prescott had addressed. \\"Only unbridled free enterprise can cure unemployment,\\" H.W. asserted, contending that government bore no responsibility for alleviating poverty. Though he lost, he began the transition to Sunbelt conservatism that would make him (barely) acceptable to Ronald Reagan as a running mate. But he never fully evolved: He famously reneged on his \\"no new taxes\\" pledge. His son George W. would complete the transition. George W.'s first major legislative accomplishment as president was the enactment of a massive 1.6 trillion tax cut. He rode roughshod over the green-eyeshade types to pass a massive tax cut. When it produced runaway deficits, he accepted Dick Cheney's argument: \\"Reagan taught us that deficits don't matter.\\" In adopting Sun Belt conservatism -- sometimes clumsily -- George H.W. and George W. anticipated the Republican Party's ideological shift. Hence, in evaluating Jeb's prescriptions for fiscal responsibility, today's Republicans should recall the Bushes' past political palm reading. Politics is about addition, not subtraction. Every year, as Republicans maintain the electoral coalition that responds to their platform, they face an inevitable subtraction from their base. That's because unyielding stances on taxes and deficits practically guarantee that young voters will continue opposing them, and the (older and whiter) constituencies who favor them shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Republicans who believe they can continue to win with their current coalition are like rats who believe they can outrun a treadmill. As the nation approaches 16 trillion of debt and grapples with the baby boomer retirement, young voters will grasp that every dollar spent on entitlement programs is a dollar paid by already-strapped young workers. That may well push young voters to support the party with the most credible deficit-reduction plan. According to 2012 exit polls, 60% of young voters (aged 18-29) supported President Barack Obama. Young voters also made up a slightly larger share of the electorate than they had in 2008. This is a huge problem for Republicans for three reasons. One, people tend to vote with higher frequencies once they hit their 30s. Two, generational cohorts tend to stick with the party they supported in their formative years. And most obviously, young voters are more likely to be around to vote in the future. If it were just about math, Jeb could convince the party to adopt what polling shows are clearly winning positions. But as the work of scholars Gary Miller and Norman Schofield suggests, it's not a linear equation: It's about momentum and intensity within the Republican coalition. That's because the newest entrants to a party's electoral coalition are usually its most robust -- and the hardest to roll in intraparty skirmishes. For Republicans, it is the mostly white and older tea partiers, who block electorally beneficial positions on taxes. The next newest entrants to the coalition are Christian conservatives, many of whom also strongly oppose tax increases. Fiscally conservative and socially progressive Rockefeller types are the oldest group, but they've been leaving the Republican Party for decades. Whereas many of them supported Republican congressional candidates in the 1970s, far less did by the 2000s. So while this group is the easiest to persuade of the need for adjustments (indeed, many already share Jeb's views), they hold the least sway in the party. What does all this mean? American parties since the Civil War have periodically shed the coalition elements that are most distant from their activist base. While Jeb's prescriptions are in the party's long-term interest, they will be difficult to execute, given the strength of the party's coalition members. Can Jeb sway a resistant party base? It's quite possible: His family's odyssey has reflected the party's shifts for 50 years, and he's uniquely positioned to convince his peers. If Republicans listen, it will constitute a return to their roots -- and a reckoning with demographic reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Smith. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Bush family has been a significant part of American politics and mainstream Republicanism for three generations. With various members holding key positions in the party, their beliefs and political stances have both anticipated and mirrored the general trajectory of the Republican party. Prescott Bush, the grandfather, was a \\"moderate progressive\\" and Eisenhower Republican. He supported urban renewal and was an advocate of fiscal responsibility. George H.W. Bush, the father, was a transitional figure who embraced Sunbelt conservatism but did not fully evolve with it, recognizing the importance of maintaining a moderate stance. George W. Bush, the son, adopted a tax-cutting, evangelical conservatism approach.  Jeb Bush, a potential presidential candidate, is seeking to bring the party back to its roots of centrism similar to the beliefs of his grandfather. He has suggested that Republicans should be open to bipartisan compromise to address the deficit significantly. However, it remains to be seen if the party will listen and adopt this approach. Jeb's prescriptions may be in the party's long-term interest, but the strength of the current Republican coalition makes it difficult to execute. The Bush family's political odyssey has mirrored the shifts in the Republican party for 50 years, and Jeb Bush could be the key figure in swaying a resistant party base towards a more moderate stance that also acknowledges demographic reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Blue Gardenia Context: Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) is the star reporter of the newspaper world and everybody knows him by his reputation as writer and a playboy. Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr) is a star commercial artist and a playboy too it seems when we meet him amidst the pool of female telephone receptionists. Both men are cruising for a date, and Crystal (Ann Southern) readily offers her phone number to Mayo, who gives it over to Prebble with Crystal's flirtatious objections. Another side of Prebble's character is seen later when he coldly rebuffs a former lover over the phone when she pleads for his attention. Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter), Crystal (Ann Southern) and Sally (Jeff Donnell) live together in what seems like a one-bedroom house and share the household duties. Each woman is shown to have a particular personality in a household built on positive outlook about life and careers. Norah plans a solitary dinner doting on the picture of her fianc, a GI stationed in Korea, but is heartbroken when his letter to her states that he is marrying someone else. Norah tries to rebound by meeting Harry Prebble who has phoned for Crystal. At dinner Prebble plies Norah with drink and charm and lures her back to his studio apartment. When he tries to force himself on her, she hits him with a poker and runs out drunken and confused. Prebble is found dead the next morning, and Norah, blanking from the alcohol she consumed, and seeing news headlines believes she may have killed him. Casey Mayo, trying to develop a story angle, comes up with the idea of publishing an open letter to the \\"Blue Gardenia Murderess\\", to turn herself in with protection from the newspaper. Norah contacts Mayo pretending to be a friend of the murderess with information on the case and the two begin to fall in love. The Police catch up with Norah soon after, and Mayo, reviewing the circumstances surrounding the murder aids the Police in further questioning of possible suspects with a startling discovery.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River?  The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate...

Write an article using the following points: U.S. researchers looked at data from 1988-1994 and 2005-2010. More parents in the earlier date range were able to tell if a child was fat. Increasing trend of weight underestimation is 'extremely alarming'","output":"Title: The Alarming Increase in Weight Underestimation Among Parents of Obese Children Introduction The health and well-being of children are of paramount importance to parents and society at large. This is why it is crucial for parents to be aware of their children's weight and whether it falls within the healthy range. Sadly, recent research has shown an alarming trend of weight underestimations among parents in the United States when it comes to identifying if a child is overweight or obese. This article will discuss the research findings, the implications of this growing issue, and possible steps that can be taken to counteract this phenomenon. Findings of the Study on Weight Underestimation U.S. researchers examined data gathered from two separate time periods, one between 1988-1994 and another between 2005-2010, to identify how well parents are able to recognize when their child is overweight or obese. The study found that more parents in the earlier date range were able to tell if a child was fat as compared to parents from the later period. This increasing trend of weight underestimation is not only shocking but is also considered as \\"extremely alarming\\" by health professionals. A failure to recognize that a child is overweight or obese can lead to a lack of intervention or delay in seeking necessary medical advice, exacerbating the child's situation and contributing to the already growing problem of childhood obesity. Implications of Weight Underestimation This increased discrepancy between the actual weight of children and parents' perception of their weight can have numerous negative implications. First and foremost, it leads to a lack of preventive measures that could help halt the child's weight gain. This could potentially result in an increased risk of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. Furthermore, it could affect the child's mental and emotional well-being, as they may suffer from low self-esteem, depression, and social isolation. There are several factors that contribute to this increasing trend of weight underestimation among parents. One possible explanation is the normalization of overweight and obesity in society, causing parents to become less attuned to identifying such issues among their own children. Additionally, parents may avoid labeling their child as \\"fat\\" due to the stigma surrounding obesity and the desire to protect their child's self-esteem. Lastly, there may be a general lack of knowledge about the appropriate weight ranges for children of different ages and height, resulting in misinterpretations of their child's weight. Steps to Counter Weight Underestimation To address this escalating issue, it is crucial to devise strategies and initiatives to better educate parents and society as a whole about childhood obesity and the importance of accurately recognizing a child's weight status. Here are some steps that can be taken: 1. Raise Awareness: Schools, healthcare providers, and government agencies can work together to implement educational programs and campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the issue of weight underestimation and childhood obesity. These can include workshops, seminars, and informative materials for parents and other caregivers. 2. Clear Guidelines: Provide easily accessible and clear guidelines for parents to identify the appropriate weight range for their children based on age and height. This can be done through online resources, educational materials, or consultations with healthcare providers. 3. Remove the Stigma: Address the societal stigma surrounding obesity and promote a culture that encourages healthy behaviors without judgment or shame. Parents should feel comfortable discussing their child's weight with healthcare providers, educators, and other support networks. 4. Promote Healthy Lifestyle: Encourage parents and families to adopt a healthy lifestyle, including balanced diets and regular physical activity. Schools and community organizations can provide supporting programs to facilitate this process, such as fitness classes, sports clubs, and nutritional counseling. Conclusion The trend of increasing weight underestimation among parents in the United States is an extremely alarming issue that should be addressed as a public health priority. By educating parents, removing the stigma surrounding obesity, and promoting a healthy lifestyle, society can help reduce the impact of childhood obesity and ensure a brighter future for the next generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, she immediately drove back to A-ville at a constant speed of 145 km/h. 3. The entire trip took 5 hours. Solution: Let x be the time it took to drive from A-ville to B-town, and y be the time it took to drive back. Total time (x + y) = 5 hours The distance between A-ville and B-town is the same both ways. Therefore, we can write the equation using speed*time = distance formula: 105x = 145y Now, we can express y in terms of x: y = (105x) / 145 Substitute this expression for y in the total time equation: x + (105x) / 145 = 5 Multiply both sides of the equation by 145 to eliminate the fraction: 145x + 105x = 725 Combine the like terms: 250x = 725 Now, divide both sides of the equation by 250: x = 2.9 So, Harriet took 2.9 hours to drive from A-ville to B-town. To convert hours into minutes, multiply by 60: 2.9 * 60 = 174 minutes Therefore, the correct answer is 174 minutes.

Its last mayor was Jens Lauritzen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.  - The Jutes, Iuti, or Iutæ were a Germanic people. According to Bede, the Jutes were one of the three most powerful Germanic peoples of their time in the Nordic Iron Age, the other two being the Saxons and the Angles.  - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).  - A heath is a shrubland habitat found mainly on free-draining infertile, acidic soils and is characterised by open, low-growing woody vegetation. Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths withespecially in the British Islesa cooler and more damp climate.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Aggersund is a town and harbour with a population of 347 ( 1 January 2014 ) in the Himmerland region of the Jutland peninsula of Denmark . At Aggersund HVDC Cross-Skagerrak crosses the strait of same name on 70 metres tall pylons . Aggersborg , the largest of Denmark 's former Viking ring castles , is located near Aggersund .  - Nibe is a town with a population of 5,093 (1 January 2014), located in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland Peninsula in northern Denmark. The town is located in a geographic region known as \\"Himmerland\\". Nibe was the site of the municipal council of Nibe Municipality. The town also holds the Nibe Festival which is held in its very own, Must Forest.  - With a length of approximately 35 km (22 statute miles), Mariager Fjord is the longest fjord in Denmark. Mariager Fjord cuts into the Jutland peninsula from the \\"Kattegat\\" sea and ends at the town of Hobro; other important towns along the fjord are Hadsund and Mariager from which the fjord takes its name. Mariager fjord makes up most of the southern limit of the traditional region of Himmerland.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands).  - Hobro [] is an old market and railway town in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark. It has a population of 11,736 (1 January 2014). The town is situated in a hilly terrain at the head of Mariager Fjord, close to the former Viking fortress of Fyrkat. It is the seat of Mariagerfjord municipality.  - Himmerland is a peninsula in northeastern Jutland, Denmark. It is delimited to the north and the west by the Limfjord, to the east by the Kattegat, and to the south by the Mariager Fjord. The largest city is Aalborg; smaller towns include Hobro, Aars, Løgstør, Støvring and Nibe. In northeastern Himmerland is the Lille Vildmose, Denmark's largest high bog, which sustains a rich bird life of international importance.  - Aalborg, also spelled Ålborg, is an industrial and university city in the North of Jutland, Denmark. It has an urban population of 112,194, making it the fourth most populous city in Denmark. With a population of 210,316, the Municipality of Aalborg is the third most populous in the country after Copenhagen and Aarhus. By road Aalborg is southwest of Frederikshavn, and north of Aarhus. The distance to Copenhagen is as the crow flies.  - The Cimbri were an ancient people, either Germanic or Celtic who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC. The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania. In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War.  - Peat, also called turf, is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, or mires. The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet because peatland plants capture the CO which is naturally released from the peat, thus maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the \\"annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition\\", but it takes \\"thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of , which is the average depth of the boreal peatlands\\". One of the most common components is \\"Sphagnum\\" moss (peat moss), although many other plants can contribute. Soils that contain mostly peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding obstructs flows of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing rates of decomposition.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - The Kattegat or Kattegatt is a sea area bounded by the Jutlandic peninsula in the west, the Danish straits islands of Denmark to the south and the provinces of Västergötland, Scania, Halland and Bohuslän in Sweden in the east. The Baltic Sea drains into the Kattegat through the Danish Straits. The sea area is a continuation of the Skagerrak and may be seen as a bay of the Baltic Sea or the North Sea or, as in traditional Scandinavian usage, neither of these.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - A bog is a wetland that accumulates peat, a deposit of dead plant materialoften mosses, and in a majority of cases, sphagnum moss. It is one of the four main types of wetlands. Other names for bogs include mire, quagmire, and muskeg; alkaline mires are called fens. They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat. The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink.  - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - The Limfjord (common Danish: \\"Limfjorden\\" , in north Jutlandish dialect: \\"Æ Limfjord\\") is a shallow part of the sea, located in Denmark where it is regarded as a fjord ever since the Vikings. However it has inlets both from the North Sea and Kattegat and hence separates the island of North Jutlandic Island (Danish: \\"Nørrejyske Ø\\", which includes the old provinces \\"Vendsyssel\\", \\"Han herred\\" and \\"Thy\\") from the rest of the Jutland Peninsula. It extends from Thyborøn Channel on the North Sea to Hals on the Kattegat. It is approximately 180 kilometres long and of an irregular shape with numerous bays, narrowings, and islands, most notably Mors, and the smaller ones Fur, Venø, Jegindø, Egholm and Livø. It is deepest at Hvalpsund (24 metres). The Limfjord is not a fjord in the English geological sense in - in Danish, as in Norwegian the term \\"fjord\\" can refer to a wide range of waterways.  - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper.  - Aars is a Danish town with a population of 8,105 (1 January 2014) in Himmerland, Denmark. Administratively, Aars is the municipal seat of Vesthimmerland municipality, Region Nordjylland since 2007 and it was also the seat of the mayor in the now abolished Aars Municipality.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process:  - You plant vegetable seeds in the ground - You water the seeds - You wait for the seeds to sprout - You keep the area free of pests and weeds while the plants grow - You thin out the plants as they get bigger to give them space to grow - You remove the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more rain happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The Perturbation Hypothesis is an important concept in understanding how changes or disturbances in environmental conditions can affect a system or a process. In this specific case, the process involves planting and cultivating vegetables, and the perturbation is an increase in rainfall. To analyze the effects of this perturbation on the yield of vegetables, we must consider both direct and indirect consequences of increased rainfall on the various steps of the planting and growing process. 1. Planting vegetable seeds in the ground: Increased rainfall can have a direct effect on this phase; the soil may become overly saturated, which could make it more difficult to plant seeds and possibly lead to seeds being washed away if the soil is too loose. Moreover, a higher water content in the soil can contribute to compaction, reducing soil aeration and limiting root growth. 2. Watering the seeds: The need to manually water the seeds would be reduced due to frequent rain. However, excessive rainfall can result in waterlogged soil, drowning seeds and preventing them from germinating. It can also leach important nutrients from the soil, reducing its fertility and potentially leading to weaker, less productive plants. 3. Waiting for the seeds to sprout: Heavy rainfall and subsequent wet conditions can delay seed germination and encourage the growth of mold and fungi, which can cause seeds to rot. This in turn could result in fewer successful sprouts and eventually, a decreased vegetable yield. 4. Keeping the area free of pests and weeds: Increased rainfall can indirectly affect this step by promoting the growth of weeds and the reproduction of pests. Pests such as slugs and snails thrive in wet conditions, while weeds might grow more quickly in the nutrient-rich soil resulting from frequent rain. Both factors can negatively impact the vegetable plants and lead to a lower vegetable yield if not managed effectively. 5. Thinning out the plants as they get bigger: Excessive rainfall may cause some plants to be more robust due to the availability of water, whereas others might struggle due to waterlogged soil or competition for other resources. This variability would require more attention during the thinning process to ensure that the most promising plants are given enough space to grow. 6. Removing the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe: Aside from potentially affecting the size and quality of the vegetables, increased rainfall could make it difficult to determine the appropriate time for harvesting. Excess water can cause some vegetables to rot or become waterlogged, leading to lower yields and decreased quality. Furthermore, frequent rain may create unfavorable conditions for picking and transporting the vegetables, potentially leading to spoilage and waste. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation - increased rainfall - can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of planting and growing vegetables, with consequences ranging from altered soil conditions and germination rates to increased pest and weed growth and challenges related to harvesting. While some of these effects may be mitigated through proper management and cultivation practices, the overall impact of increased rainfall on vegetable yields is likely to be negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of removing more salt from the water would have a direct effect on the process. If more salt is removed from the water, the effectiveness of the desalination process will increase, resulting in a higher quality and purity of the drinking water produced. To achieve a higher level of salt removal, adjustments may need to be made to the desalination process, such as increasing the boiling time or employing more advanced separation techniques. This could potentially affect other aspects of the process, such as energy consumption and operational costs, but overall, it would lead to a more efficient and effective desalination process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Ministers are phasing in new, toughened GCSEs and originally said the old ones would count in league tables during the transition to the new exams. Now old GCSEs will count for students but not for school accountability. The government said the move meant consistency between exams. Ministers have pushed through a range of changes to GCSE and A-level exams which require complete new syllabuses and examinations to be drawn up, approved and accredited. English and maths GCSEs are being introduced this year, with other subjects to reach schools for teaching in 2016. Many schools, however, run three-year GCSE programmes, which start in Year 9, with some exams being taken in Year 10 and some in Year 11. This enables students to spread exams over two years, rather than having to take a large number of exams in one, and creates space in the timetable to focus on key subjects such as English and maths in Year 11. Students starting these three-year courses in September cannot take the reformed GCSEs in Year 10 because they are not yet available. So, schools had planned that GCSEs taken in Year 10 would be in the unreformed older courses. ASCL president Peter Kent said: \\"School leaders are now left with an invidious dilemma. \\"They must either change decisions already made with students and parents, and rip up existing timetables, to make sure everybody takes the new reformed GCSEs, or press on with the plans they already had in place and accept that their performance tables will suffer because they will include unreformed GCSEs. \\"This has plunged schools, students and parents into disruption and uncertainty.\\" Dr Kent said: \\"It is absolute nonsense. These are perfectly valid qualifications which reflect the achievements of students, but which schools will not be allowed to include in their figures. \\"One subject which is particularly affected is religious education because this is a GCSE which is sat in many schools in Year 10.\\" Mr Kent, who is also head teacher of Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby, said: \\"In my school we have decided to take the hit on performance tables, but there is no right answer. It is a case of damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't. \\"ASCL is very disappointed that despite clearly showing to ministers and officials that this decision is profoundly unfair, they have refused to budge. We have asked them to be reasonable, but our appeal has fallen on deaf ears.\\" A Department for Education spokesman said: \\"Our new world-class GCSEs are raising the bar so more young people have access to the world-class education they deserve, equipping them with the skills they need to get on and succeed in life. \\"We want pupils to be taught these new gold standard GCSE courses as soon as possible. \\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The UK government has decided that old GCSEs will count for students but not for school accountability during the transition to the new exams, causing disruption and uncertainty for schools, students, and parents.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information:  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Eusthenodon is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish. \\"Eusthenodon\\" lived during the Late Devonian period (Frasnian to Famennian faunal stages), around 385 to 359 million years ago. Remains of \\"Eusthenodon\\" have been found in Greenland, Russia, South Africa and more recently in Belgium for the first time. This genus belonged to the family Tristichopteridae, a clade which became extinct at the end of the Devonian. This family is known for some large genera, such as \\"Hyneria\\". \\"Eusthenodon\\" was about long, and among palaeontologists it is regarded as one of the most derived form of this group.  - Hyneria is a genus of prehistoric predatory lobe-finned fish that lived during the Devonian period around 360 million years ago.  - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - In evolutionary biology, adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niches. Starting with a recent single ancestor, this process results in the speciation and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits. An example of adaptive radiation would be the avian species of the Hawaiian honeycreepers. Via natural selection, these birds adapted rapidly and converged based on the different environments of the Hawaiian islands.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - Tristichopterids ( Tristichopteridae ) were a diverse and successful group of tetrapodomorph fishes living throughout the Middle and Late Devonian . They first appeared in the Givetian stage of the Middle Devonian . Within the group sizes ranged from a few tens of centimeters ( Tristichopterus ) to several meters ( Hyneria and Eusthenodon ) . Some tristichopterids share some of the features of the elpistostegalians , a paraphyletic assemblage of fishes close to the origin of tetrapods . This mainly concerns the shape of the skull and a reduction in size of the posterior fins . An old and persistent notion is that Eusthenopteron was able to crawl onto land using its fins . However , there is no evidence actually supporting this idea . All tristichopterids went extinct by the end of Late Devonian .  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Tristichopterus is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period. \\"Tristichopterus\\" belongs to the family Tristichopteridae.  - The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician-Silurian extinction event when 60% of marine species were wiped out.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied. The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment.  - Placodermi (from the Greek  = plate and  = skin, literally \\"plate-skinned\\") is an extinct class of armoured prehistoric fish, known from fossils, which lived from the Silurian to the end of the Devonian Period. Their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches. Placoderms are paraphyletic, and consist of several distinct outgroups or sister taxa to all living jawed vertebrates, which originated among their ranks. This is illustrated by a 419-million-year-old fossil, \\"Entelognathus\\", from China, which is the only known placoderm with a type of bony jaw like that found in modern bony fishes. This includes a dentary bone, which is found in humans and other tetrapods. The jaws in other placoderms were simplified and consisted of a single bone. Placoderms were also the first fish to develop pelvic fins, the precursor to hindlimbs in tetrapods, as well as true teeth. 380-million-year-old fossils of three other genera, \\"Incistoscutum\\", \\"Materpiscis\\" and \\"Austroptyctodus\\", represent the oldest known examples of live birth.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Options are: a. negative. b. positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? mesmerizing performance","output":"The phrase \\"mesmerizing performance\\" can be considered positive. This detailed explanation will help you understand why this phrase is positive and the context in which it may be used. First, let's break the phrase down into its constituent words: \\"mesmerizing\\" and \\"performance.\\" 1. Mesmerizing: The word \\"mesmerizing\\" is an adjective that is used to describe something that has a captivating or enchanting effect on others. Usually, mesmerizing events, objects or people draw great amounts of attention due to their beauty, skill, or unique characteristics. When someone or something is described as mesmerizing, it implies that it is so alluring that one cannot help but pay attention to and be fascinated by it. 2. Performance: In this context, \\"performance\\" is a noun that typically refers to an act of presenting a form of art, such as theater, music, dance, or other creative expressions. A performance could be a live theatrical play, a concert, a ballet, or any other artistic presentation. The word \\"performance\\" in itself doesn't have any particularly positive or negative connotation; however, it can be influenced by the adjectives or other modifiers that come with it. Now, let's combine the two words back together in the phrase \\"mesmerizing performance.\\" When we say that a performance is mesmerizing, we imply that the performance is so engaging, captivating, and enchanting that the audience is completely drawn into it. It points to an exceptional level of skill, creativity, talent, and mastery of the craft from the performers. They manage to evoke a sense of wonder and admiration in the viewers, creating a memorable experience that leaves a lasting impression. In summary, the phrase \\"mesmerizing performance\\" is positive because it conveys a sense of captivation, enchantment, and admiration that emerges from witnessing an exceptional display of artistic talent and creativity. It is often used when referring to performances that excel and leave the audience in awe, reflecting that the performers have truly outdone themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is specifically designed to serve as a one-stop shopping destination, making it a convenient and efficient choice for such requirements. Let's explore the reasons behind this choice in more detail: 1. Diverse Shopping Options: A mall typically houses numerous retail outlets that cater to various product categories, including fashion and books. After shopping for the latest fashion items at the numerous clothing stores available, the person can easily find a bookshop within the same premises, saving time and effort. 2. Convenience: Given the close proximity of different kinds of shops in a mall, customers can effortlessly move between them, thus simplifying the shopping process and eliminating the need to travel between disparate locations, such as a department store and a separate bookshop. 3. Comfort and Atmosphere: Malls are typically designed with customer comfort in mind, providing a well-maintained, temperature-controlled, and pleasant environment to shop in. Additionally, they offer a wide range of amenities such as restrooms, seating areas, food courts, and parking facilities, making the shopping experience enjoyable and less exhausting. 4. Social Experience: Malls serve not just as a shopping destination but also as a social hub, offering abundant opportunities for entertainment, leisure, and interaction with other shoppers. Thus, visiting a mall provides a more comprehensive and engaging experience than simply going to a standalone store or a library. 5. Extended Hours of Operation: Malls usually have longer hours of operation compared to standalone bookshops, department stores, and libraries, allowing customers the flexibility to shop according to their own convenience. Comparing the other options: - Student Union: This option might have a limited selection, targeting students' needs specifically, and may not have the latest fashion or a wide range of books to choose from. - Department Store: While department stores may offer fashionable clothing, they often do not have a dedicated book section, and if they do, the selection can be quite limited. - Library: This option is dedicated to books but typically doesn't cater to retail fashion needs. Moreover, libraries focus on lending books rather than selling them. - Town or City: This option is too broad and does not offer a specific location or direct guidance on where to find both fashion items and bookshops within the city. Thus, considering the diverse shopping options, convenience, comfortable atmosphere, social engagement, and extended hours of operation, a human would choose \\"mall\\" as the most appropriate answer when it comes to visiting a bookshop after buying the latest fashion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nest building materials:  As the Earth gets warmer, some building materials that birds commonly use for their nests may become scarce. For instance, plants that provide twigs and grasses may be affected by changing climates and altered rainfall patterns, leading to less availability of these materials for nest building. As a result, birds living in a warmer environment may have to adapt their nest-building habits, leading to less or smaller nests. 2. Thermal regulation: In a warmer environment, smaller nests may provide better thermal regulation due to their compact size. Smaller nests can help birds maintain a cooler temperature for their eggs and chicks as they don't trap too much heat. In this case, a warmer environment could result in more smaller nests as birds adapt their nest building habits to ensure the survival of their offspring. 3. Behavioral changes:  Warmer climates can also bring about changes in bird behavior, which can subsequently affect nesting patterns. Birds may adjust their nesting times during warmer periods, either by starting earlier in the spring or delaying their nesting until they can find suitable conditions. This shift in timing could impact the demand for nesting materials and the number of nests built. It might lead to a situation where there are more, less, or no effect on smaller nests due to these changes. 4. Ecological factors:  Warmer temperatures also influence ecological factors, such as the availability of food sources and changes in predator populations. In some cases, a warmer climate could increase food abundance for birds, which might lead to an increase in their population size. This could result in more competition for nest-building materials and space, as well as an increase in predator pressure. These factors could have a varied impact on smaller nests - it could lead to an increase in smaller nests due to higher competition, less smaller nests as birds are forced to build nests in locations not suitable for them, or no effect if other factors counterbalance these ecological changes. 5. Habitats:  Environmental changes due to global warming may lead to shifts in bird habitats. Some bird species might be forced to find new areas to build their nests due to the loss of their previous habitats. Consequently, birds might have to adapt to new conditions by building different types or sizes of nests, based on the availability of resources and environmental features. These habitat modifications could result in more, less, or no effect on smaller nests, depending on the specific circumstances. In conclusion, the impact of a warmer Earth on smaller bird nests is multifaceted and hard to predict with certainty. The effect could be more, less, or no impact on smaller nests, based on factors like nest materials, thermal regulation, bird behaviors, ecological factors, and habitat shifts. Each bird species might experience unique challenges due to global warming, which will determine the ultimate outcome on their nesting patterns, including the less or smaller nests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Koizumi Exits Office as He Arrived: Defiant on War Shrine TOKYO, Aug. 15 — With each annual visit Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has paid to the Yasukuni Shrine, the war memorial linked to Japan’s imperial past, the damage to the nation’s relations with China and South Korea has worsened. Even as Mr. Koizumi claimed a more assertive role for Japan in the world — and called for China’s and South Korea’s endorsement to realize it — he chose to be unyielding on his visits to Yasukuni, the one issue that was certain to offend them to the core and stir up memories of exactly why they fear a newly assertive Japan. One result was that by Mr. Koizumi’s last year in office, China’s and South Korea’s leaders refused to talk with him. But true to himself to the very end, Mr. Koizumi paid his sixth and most likely last visit as prime minister — he retires next month — to the shrine early Tuesday morning, on the anniversary of the end of World War II and East Asia’s liberation from Japanese rule. Mr. Koizumi not only chose the most provocative of days, but responded angrily to his critics in a news conference after his visit. He blamed China and South Korea for worsening relations, saying he had always been ready to meet with their leaders despite their opposition to Japan’s efforts to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. He waved away their repeated demands that he stop visiting the shrine, adding that he would not have acceded to such a demand even if it had come from President Bush. “But President Bush wouldn’t say anything so immature,” Mr. Koizumi said. The visit drew immediate condemnation from China and South Korea, as well as from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia. But just as severe was the criticism within Japan, where many political leaders, major business groups and nearly all the major daily newspapers had pressed him to cease the visits. “He may be able to get away with it, but he has to think it over more deeply,” Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister and the elder statesman of Mr. Koizumi’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in a television interview. Mr. Nakasone, who was the last prime minister to visit Yasukuni on the Aug. 15 anniversary, 21 years ago, stopped praying at the shrine after China protested. Unlike Mr. Nakasone, Mr. Koizumi never stopped. Even though he no longer has any elections to face, Mr. Koizumi is said to have wanted to keep a campaign pledge he made half a decade ago to visit the shrine every year, including on Aug. 15. Mr. Koizumi had also painted himself into a corner by turning the Yasukuni debate into a test of wills. Stopping the visits would have meant backing down to China. In turn, the more China and South Korea criticized Japan over Yasukuni, the more the criticism fueled nationalist sentiments here. The focus on China has made it difficult to have a genuine public debate over Yasukuni, and its role in Japanese society. Yasukuni was built in 1869 as part of Japan’s drive to establish a strong, modern country founded on a nationalistic state religion with a divine emperor at the center. The first soldiers deified in Yasukuni were those who fought and died for the emperor in a civil war, ignoring soldiers on the losing side. Other enshrined soldiers died in conflicts that revolved around Japan’s wars against China and the United States and the occupations of Korea and Taiwan. In 1978, 14 prominent war criminals were secretly enshrined there. With only a month left before Mr. Koizumi’s retirement, attention here and in the region has already turned to how his successor will deal with Yasukuni. “The response from Korea and China today was relatively small because Koizumi is an outgoing prime minister,” said Park Cheol-hee, an expert in Japanese politics at Seoul National University. Mr. Koizumi’s most likely successor, Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary, is a hawk who has strongly supported the Yasukuni visits. In what appeared to be a well-timed leak by his office, the Japanese news media reported recently that Mr. Abe had secretly prayed at Yasukuni in April. But Mr. Abe refused to confirm or deny the report, and said he would not comment on any future visits. Mr. Abe’s strategy is not likely to satisfy fully Yasukuni’s supporters or critics, but it may present a face-saving way for Japan, China and South Korea to resume talking. “If Abe maintains this ambiguity about Yasukuni when he becomes prime minister, it could allow the South Korean government to respond favorably,” Mr. Park said. “It may be a way out of this deadlock issue. At least, he can buy himself some time before looking for a more permanent compromise. “If he sticks to the Koizumi line, he’ll be in trouble with Korea and China.” A version of this article appears in print on , on page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Koizumi Exits Office as He Arrived: Defiant on War Shrine. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In his last year in office, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine further strained Japan's relations with China and South Korea, leading to a refusal of dialogue from their leaders.

Workers at the fast-food joint who pooled their cash for tickets are furious at a colleague who claims she won with a ticket she bought for herself and has no intention of sharing.      “We had a group plan, but I went and played by myself. [The ‘winning’ ticket] wasn’t on the group plan,” McDonald’s “winner’’ Mirlande Wilson 37, told The Post yesterday, insisting she alone bought one of the three tickets nationwide that will split a record 656 million payout.      “I was in the group, but this was separate. The winning ticket was a separate ticket,” the single mother of seven said as she and her fiancé left her home in the squalid Westport neighborhood to attend church.      The Haitian immigrant refused to show what she said was the winning ticket, claiming she had it hidden in another location and would present it to lottery officials today.      Pressed as the day went on, she became more cagey.      “I don’t know if I won. Some of the numbers were familiar. I recognized some of [them],’’ she said. “I don’t know why’’ people are saying differently. “I’m going to go to the lottery office [today]. I bought some tickets separately.”      With winning tickets also sold in Illinois and Kansas, a single Maryland winner would get an after-tax lump sum of 105 million, or 5.59 million a year for 26 years.      If Wilson won, and if it was with a pooled work ticket, the situation would be shockingly similar to that of New Jersey lottery louse Americo Lopes, who tried to screw five former colleagues after hitting a 24 million jackpot before a jury ordered him to spread the wealth.      Wilson’s co-workers — who make little more than 7.50 an hour — are sizzling with anger over the notion.      “She can’ t do this to us!” said Suleiman Osman Husein, a shift manager and one of 15 members in the pool. “We each paid 5. She took everybody’s money!”      A man identifying himself as the boyfriend of a McDonald’s manager named Layla, who was part of the pool, said Wilson bought tickets for the group at the 7-Eleven in Milford Mill, where the winning ticket was sold.      The group’s tickets — along with a list of those who contributed to the pool — were left in an office safe at the burger joint, said the man, who gave only his first name, Allen, as he stood next to Layla. She declined to comment.      Then, late Friday, before the night’s drawing, the owner of the McDonald’s, Birul Desai, gave Wilson 5 to buy more tickets for the pool on her way home from work, and she went back to the 7-Eleven and bought them, Allen said.      Wilson took those tickets home with her, Allen said.      But Wilson insisted yesterday that she had bought the second batch with an unidentified pal — not for the pool — and that the winning ticket was among them.      A day earlier, a delirious Wilson had called co-workers to break the news — tellingly used the first-person singular.      “I won! I won!” she cried, Allen said.      Another colleague, Davon Wilson, no relation, said he was there when Mirlande Wilson called.      “She said, ‘Turn on the news.’ She said she had won. I thought it was a joke or something. She doesn’t seem like a person who’d do this,” he said.      Allan said he and Layla went to Wilson’s home and pounded on the door for 20 minutes until she finally came out.      “These people are going to kill you. It’s not worth your life!” Allen said he told her.      “All right! All right! I’ll share, but I can’t find the ticket right now,” she finally said, according to Allen.      Yohannes Michael, a clerk at the 7-Eleven where Wilson bought the tickets, expressed doubts about her story when he said yesterday that lottery officials have reviewed the store’s video and believe that a man bought the winning ticket. Lottery rep Carole Everett would not confirm that.      Reached at his Fairfax, Va., home, Desai, the McDonald’s owner, declined to comment except to say, “It’s all bulls–t, if you ask me. It’s speculation.” ||||| The director of the Maryland Lottery says no one in the state has stepped forward with a winning Mega Millions lottery ticket yet.      Stephen Martino said Monday on NBC's \\"Today\\" show that the ticket, one of three winning tickets purchased for the record-breaking 640 million prize, has yet to be claimed.      The New York Post reported Monday that McDonald's employee Mirlande Wilson claims she holds the winning ticket. The newspaper reports that Wilson plans to contact lottery officials Monday.

Consequently, it is considered improper to use one's left hand for holding food, touching others, or passing objects as it may offend certain guests. It is essential to be aware of these cultural differences to ensure a harmonious and respectful environment for all visitors. Similarly, some Westerners may be offended if you touch them or their personal belongings, even by accident. In such instances, it is vital to apologize politely to maintain a friendly and enjoyable interaction. Furthermore, some elderly Westerners may feel offended if you attempt to help them without their permission. Thus, it is best to ask for their consent before offering assistance to ensure they feel comfortable and respected. Different cultures may have specific beliefs regarding numbers, with some Westerners avoiding the number 13 due to its perceived association with bad luck. Awareness of these beliefs will help provide a considerate and hospitable environment for guests from all cultural backgrounds. Religious dietary restrictions and preferences are also crucial to consider. For example, Muslims are prohibited from consuming pork, and words like 'pig' are considered inappropriate. Being mindful of these restrictions and adjusting the menu and conversation topics accordingly can contribute to a positive and inclusive atmosphere. Various cultural beliefs might also dictate specific gift-giving guidelines. For instance, people from Brazil, Italy, and Pakistan avoid giving handkerchiefs as gifts since they are thought to be associated with unhappy emotions. In many parts of western and middle Asia, where a majority of Muslims reside, wine is not an appropriate gift either. Lastly, regarding the question about Indians and the left hand, the answer is A) unclean. Indians consider the left hand unclean, which is why they avoid using it to hold food. By understanding and respecting these cultural differences and sensitivities, you can create a welcoming and enjoyable experience for guests from all over the world during their August visit."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why is the female narrator so grateful to the man ?","output":"The female narrator is grateful to the man, presumably named Tyler, for several reasons as inferred from the passage.  Firstly, she appreciates his affectionate and caring nature. This is evidenced by the sentence, “He is so sweet to them.” While the passage doesn't provide explicit details on who 'them' refers to, it could presumably be children or other family members, further implying his role as a loving family man.  Secondly, he brings joy and positivity into her life, illustrated in the line, “He loves to make us laugh.” This reference to shared humor and the man’s desire to create a light-hearted and joyous atmosphere exhibit a quality in him that significantly contributes to the narrator’s gratefulness.  Thirdly, the man offers emotional support to her, making efforts to help her maintain a positive outlook on life, which is indicated by “he tries really hard to help me be a happy mom.” This suggests that he is sensitive to the narrator's mental well-being and actively endeavors to ensure her happiness, revealing an empathetic and considerate personality.  The narrator also values their intimate conversations and his willingness to share deeper thoughts and feelings with her, as stated in the line, “I love talking to him at night (when he spills his guts).” Therefore, a level of emotional intimation is maintained between them, contributing to her gratefulness due to the deepened trust and mutual understanding. Moreover, the narrator is impressed with the man's ability to handle daily situations. This is suggested by, “I am always amazed at how he handles the day's situations.” Even though it is not explicitly stated what these situations are, it can be interpreted that he copes effectively with everyday challenges, a trait that the narrator greatly admires.  Also, his passion – represented through his love for hockey from a young age – could be another factor because it suggests consistency and commitment, which are desirable traits.

Here is a news article: Goalkeeper Hope Solo has been suspended from the U.S. women's national team for 30 days and won't participate in matches next month in Europe.      In a photo provided by the Manhattan Beach, Calif., Police Department, Jerramy Stevens appears in a booking photo. Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end and the husband of U.S. soccer goalkeeper... (Associated Press)      FILE - In this Oct. 20, 2013, file photo, United States goalkeeper Hope Solo pauses on the field during the second half of an international friendly women's soccer match against Australia in San Antonio.... (Associated Press)      U.S. Soccer did not specify the reason for the suspension, announced Wednesday night. It comes after the arrest of her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, earlier this week on suspicion of driving under the influence.      Solo was in the car when Stevens was pulled over in Manhattan Beach, California, about 1:30 a.m. Monday for driving without headlights. Solo was not arrested or detained.      It is the latest off-field trouble for Solo. Earlier this month, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her.      The 33-year-old goalkeeper was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June.      \\"During our current national team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,\\" coach Jill Ellis said in a statement. \\"We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.\\"      Solo, who has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. team, was released from camp.      \\"I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me,\\" Solo said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Wednesday night. \\"I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.\\"      The domestic violence charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington last June.      Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case, and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial.      Solo married Stevens in 2012. He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged.      Her last appearance with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia.      Last September in an exhibition victory over Mexico, Solo logged her 72nd shutout, passing Briana Scurry (1994-2008) on national team's career list.      The suspension comes at a critical time for the U.S. team.      Following the exhibition matches in February, the U.S. team will play in the Algarve Cup in March. The team will open World Cup play on June 8 against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba.      An expanded field of 24 teams will compete in the World Cup, which will be played in six Canadian cities. The United States is in Group D, which also includes Sweden and Nigeria.      The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title but first since 1991.      Solo will be eligible for reinstatement after the suspension, pending review and approval by U.S. Soccer and Ellis, U.S. Soccer said. ||||| TMZ Sports      It's now time to reevaluate who your Valentine is this year ... because UFC star Arianny Celeste is doing a super hot lingerie shoot for Lovers Day ... and she doesn't know you exist.… ||||| Hope Solo, the star goalkeeper of the United States women’s national team, has been suspended for 30 days because of an \\"incident\\" during the team’s ongoing training camp in Southern California, U.S. Soccer announced. The suspension is effective immediately.      According to TMZ Sports, Solo, 33, was in a car with her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, when they were pulled over around 2 a.m. on Monday. Stevens was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. Solo was also heavily inebriated, according to the report.      [FC Yahoo: The one lingering problem that MLS must address]      The incident occurred just a week after the dismissal of Solo’s domestic violence case in which she had been charged with two counts of assault for a June altercation with her half-sister and nephew.      Story Continues      \\"During our current National Team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,\\" U.S. head coach Jill Ellis said in a statement. \\"We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.\\"      Solo responded on Facebook. \\"I accept and respect the Federation’s decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me,\\" she wrote. \\"I think it’s best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.\\"      Once again, the incident is exceedingly poorly timed, with the USA getting ready for this summer’s Women’s World Cup in Canada and Solo only just getting out of her latest run-in with the law. She and Stevens had also been involved in a domestic violence case on the eve of their 2012 wedding that was dismissed for a lack of evidence.      Solo is inarguably a difference maker on the field and badly needed if the Americans are to finally end their 16-year World Cup drought. There is no way to replace her without suffering a significant talent drop-off at the goalkeeper position.      [FC Yahoo: So far, Luis Suarez has been a bust for Barcelona]      Plainly, U.S. Soccer had little choice but to suspend her for this latest incident, since it had happened while Solo was with the team (which pays its members a full-time salary). The federation had stood by Solo and allowed her to keep playing while her assault charges awaited trial, allowing the justice system to run its course – even celebrating her record-setting 72nd shutout with the national team and awarding her the captain’s armband the following game. Her case was dismissed when her accusers failed on several occasions to be interviewed by her lawyer.      That incident had happened while she was away from the team. U.S. Soccer didn’t have all the information then; it did this time around. So for the sake of its integrity, the federation had to send Solo home. But in Ellis’s build-up to the World Cup, this is a major inconvenience, with testing friendlies in France and England coming up – both of which Solo will miss.      There are no guarantees that Solo will be back at all. Ellis and the federation might decide the goalie is more trouble than she’s worth and too much of a distraction as the team heads into the high-pressure environment of a World Cup just across its own border. After her assault case, Solo was on thin ice, and she just dunked right through it.      Solo, for her part, is putting a lot at stake by failing to suppress her undeniable talent for finding trouble. At her age, this could well be her last World Cup. And she continues to tarnish a well-established mainstream brand – she has a varied portfolio of endorsements and has appeared on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and in ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue – potentially leaving huge amounts of money on the table.      With just 138 days left before the USA kicks off its World Cup, it might have to go looking for a new goalkeeper.      Leander Schaerlaeckens is a soccer columnist for Yahoo Sports.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the final step of the following process: -  A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward Answer:","output":"The final step in the process of mold growth on bread, after sporangiophores grow upward, is the formation and release of new mold spores into the environment. This ensures the continuation of the mold's life cycle and its ability to spread to other surfaces. Sporangiophores are specialized hyphae that support the reproductive structures of the mold. At the tips of these sporangiophores, sporangia develop, which are sac-like structures that contain spores. These sporangia are essential for mold reproduction as they produce and store the new spores. As the mold colony matures and establishes a dense network of hyphae, the sporangia at the tips of the sporangiophores fill up with spores. Eventually, the sporangia mature and rupture, releasing the spores contained within. These newly released spores are then carried by airflow, insects, or other means to new locations in the environment, where they have the potential to land on suitable substrates and initiate new mold growth cycles. This process of releasing new spores is crucial for the mold's survival and propagation. Mold spores are incredibly resilient, capable of surviving harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, dry spells, and other unfavorable environments for extended periods. These hardy spores can remain dormant until they encounter favorable conditions for growth, such as moisture and a suitable nutrient source like bread. Once they land on a suitable surface and the conditions are right, they will germinate, grow hyphae, and start developing a new mold colony, repeating the cycle of growth and reproduction. In summary, the final step after sporangiophores grow upward in the mold growth process on bread is the formation and release of new mold spores, ensuring the continuation of the mold's life cycle and its ability to spread and colonize new surfaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.

Choices: - The unearthliness and the grandeur of its architecture.; - The presence of American super stars.; - The saying made by American writers and journalists.; - The roaring of the river in the Canyon.; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A famous American John Muir said in 1898: \\"The Grand Canyon... as unearthly   in the color and grandeur   of its architecture as if you had found it after death on some other star.\\" Like Muir, those of us who stand along the rim are prompted to wonder about the unearthliness and the forces that created and are still changing this place. After more than 100 years of studies, many things are still mysterious. Today visitors come by the thousands -- the great and simple of the earth -- all in a spirit of wonder. Travelers come from every state of the Union, from every country in Europe and Asia. From the depths of the canyon comes welling silence. Seldom can you hear the roar of the river, for all sounds are swallowed in this gulf of space. \\"It makes one want to murmur.\\" A woman once whispered to her companion. This silence is not the silence of death; rather, it is a presence. It is like a great piece of music. But music made of man works up to a climax   and stops. Now, visitors to the South Rim alone may number 18,000 in a single day. Some of that number will travel by mule train down Bright Angel Trail to the canyon's floor, cross the raging river by a suspension bridge   and walk to the North Rim. Though the two rims face each other across only 12 miles, it is a journey of 214 miles by car from one to the other. Nor can you visit the North Rim except in summer; some 1,200 feet higher than the South Rim, it is snow covered much of the year except in July and August. But there is no day that you may not visit the South Rim and find the sun warm on your face and the air perfumed with the incense   of smoke from an Indian hearth  .

John Muir described the Grand Canyon as possessing an unearthly quality in its color and grandeur, making it seem as if it belonged to another world.

Nosey Barbon, who wants to be Jimson's protégé, greets Jimson at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, but Jimson tries to discourage Nosey from pursuing painting for a living. Jimson goes to his houseboat, which his older lady friend Coker has been maintaining in his absence. Jimson tries to borrow money from Hickson and Coker. Jimson and Coker later visit Hickson to secure payment for Jimson's artwork. Jimson tries to steal works back from Hickson's place but Coker stops him. Hickson calls the police, but Jimson and Coker escape. Jimson responds to a note from A. W. Alabaster, secretary to Sir William and Lady , who are interested in acquiring Jimson's early artworks.

Question: What were the examples of locales that picked up a lot of the Hellenic culture? Context: Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \\"barbarians\\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class. The answer to this question is:","output":"The locales that picked up a lot of the Hellenic culture were primarily the great cities like Alexandria and Antioch.

The latest study about antioxidants is terrifying. Scientists think they may boost cancer cells to spread faster. Since the term \\"antioxidants\\" made the leap from the realm of biochemistry labs and into the public consciousness in the 1990s, Americans have come to believe that more is better when it comes to consuming the substance that comes in things like acai berries, green tea and leafy veggies. A provocative new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature raises important questions about that assumption. Antioxidants — which include vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, and are contained in thousands of foods — are thought to protect cells from damage by acting as defenders against something called \\"free radicals\\" which the body produces as a part of metabolism or that can enter through the environment. That's all great for normal cells. But what researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found is that antioxidants can work their magic on cancerous cells, too — turbo-charging the process by which they grow and spread. Researcher Sean Morrison and his colleagues conducted experiments on mice that had been transplanted with skin cancer cells (melanoma) from human patients. They gave nothing to one group. To the other they gave doses of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) which is a common antioxidant that's used in nutritional and bodybuilding supplements and has been used as a treatment for patients with HIV/AIDS and in some children with certain genetic disorders. The results were alarming: Those in the second group had markedly higher levels of cancer cells in their blood, grew more tumors and the tumors were larger and more widespread than in the second. \\"What we're starting to learn is that there can be bad cells from cancer that appear to benefit more from antioxidants than normal cells,\\" he said in an interview. Morrison, director of the Children’s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern, explained that it has to do with something called oxidative stress. Scientists have known for a while now that cancer metastasis — especially when it involves spreading a great distance to another part of the body — is a very inefficient process and that many cells die along the way. This is likely due to oxidative stress, which is an inability by the body to counteract the harmful effect of free radicals. When antioxidants supplements are given, the paper hypothesizes, they may give new life to those cancerous cells that are on the edge of dying. Morrison said that previous studies have shown that the progression of metastasis of human melanoma cells in mice is predictive of their metastasis in humans, which raises concerns about the use of dietary antioxidants by patients with cancer. Moreover, melanoma may not be the only type of cancer to be affected this way. A similar study conducted at Vanderbilt University and published in PLoS One in 2012 involving mice with prostate cancer also showed that antioxidants appeared to increase the proliferation of cells in the pre-cancerous lesions. And another one in rodents with lung cancer published in Science Translational Medicine in 2014 found that normal doses of vitamin E and smaller doses of acetylcysteine, an antioxidant supplement, appeared to lead to a three-fold increase in the number of tumors and caused them to be more aggressive. As a result, the mice given antioxidants died twice as fast the ones in the control group. The reaction appeared be dose dependent with larger doses leading to a more severe reaction. Morrison said that further study needs to be done to confirm the findings and that cancer patients should still consume antioxidants as part of a healthy diet. But, he added, \\"personally, from the results we've seen, I would avoid supplementing my diet with large amounts of antioxidants if I had cancer.\\" Over the past 20 years, numerous studies were launched to ascertain the effect of antioxidants on other conditions ranging from heart disease to memory loss. Early results have mostly been mixed, but that hasn't stopped food companies from hyping their disease-fighting abilities. This post has been updated.

In each bundle, separating the xylem and phloem, is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium. By the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles (interfascicular cambium), a complete ring is formed, and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. The soft phloem becomes crushed, but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial. Owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season, the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one for each season of growth, called annual rings.

An amnesiac Queens woman who vanished 21 years ago may have been spotted walking the aisles of a South Carolina Walmart earlier this month. Fresh Meadows resident Renee LaManna, now 57, suffered a nervous breakdown after her boyfriend of 10 years broke things off in 1994, older sister Margaret LaManna said. She was found barefoot in frigid conditions in Queens on Jan. 8, 1994, and was taken to her sister’s Ocean City, N.J., home after a brief stay at Queens Center Psychiatric Hospital. That’s the last time the sisters saw one another. Renee LaManna ran away that night, and as her sister searched for her as a missing person, occasional reported sightings proved LaManna was alive. The quest is still alive too. The family has doggedly documented motel stays, police booking photos and hired private investigators and even a retired FBI agent along the way. “I have spent 21 years looking for Renee,” Margaret LaManna wrote. “My parents suffered greatly. They died looking for Renee.” The hunt heated up again this year. Since January alone, the family has received reports of LaManna in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, North and South Carolina. North Carolina police issued a Silver Alert for LaManna in March. Then came a break. The Cape May County Prosecutor’s Office sent out an alert Aug. 18 to authorities in Virginia, North and South Carolina. LaManna was spotted at a Walmart in Taylors, S.C. “I’m looking for my family, I can’t understand why they can’t find me,” the woman, who uses several aliases, tells people who try to help her, Margaret LaManna said. LaManna reportedly hitchhikes with truckers and stays in shelters. She is mentally ill, her sister warns, but is a threat only to herself and not others. And she is still on an endless road, far from home. Other people have joined the hunt. “We drive in circles, I go into stores and hand out flyers,” said Linda Craig of Asheville, N.C., told WHNS. “I know that Renee is out there, because I saw her. I know she is alive, I know she is out there.” A Scranton, Penn., transport company painted LaManna’s image on the back of a 53-foot tractor-trailer with the words “Please find me!” Anyone with information regarding the Queens woman can contact Margaret LaManna through Twitter, Facebook or by calling 888-RENEE11.

Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. Question: What can we learn from Viry-Babel? Options: A: The app is cheap but must work in the lab. B: The white cells and the platelets must be studied carefully. C: The accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent. D: The \\"Diagnose\\" button should function well with others.","output":"From Viry-Babel, we can learn that the accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent (option C)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  and the situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Answer the following question: Which person will not have convex lenses in their glasses? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the information given: 1. Farsightedness (hyperopia) can be corrected with convex lenses. 2. Kathy is farsighted. 3. Jacob is nearsighted. Since Kathy is farsighted, she will have convex lenses in her glasses to correct her vision. On the other hand, Jacob is nearsighted, which means his condition is different from Kathy's, and he requires a different type of lens to correct his vision. Nearsightedness (myopia) is usually corrected with concave lenses. So, Jacob will not have convex lenses in his glasses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Rob Kardashian, an American television personality and member of the famous Kardashian family, has struggled with his weight and related health issues for many years. In 2016, he was diagnosed with diabetes and since then, he has been trying to make lifestyle changes and commit to a healthier routine to improve his overall health. As for surgery, it is not publicly confirmed that Rob Kardashian underwent any specific surgical procedures to address his weight or health issues. However, there have been speculations and rumors regarding potential weight loss surgeries like gastric sleeve or gastric bypass to help him lose weight. It is important to recognize that these speculations may be based on observations of his weight changes over the years but might not necessarily be accurate, especially given the privacy concerns of celebrities. There have also been discussions about potential surgeries for addressing his diabetes. For some people with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in improving blood sugar control and even achieving diabetes remission. However, again, there is no public confirmation that Rob Kardashian underwent such a surgery. It is worth noting that Rob has made attempts to transform his lifestyle to address his health issues without surgery. This includes changes to his diet, regular exercise, therapy, and possibly working with nutritionists and trainers to shed excess weight and manage his diabetes. Over time, he has shown noticeable progress in his weight loss journey, which could have been achieved without necessarily undergoing any specific surgeries. Some people may mistakenly attribute this progress to surgery, but it is important to recognize the tremendous effort and dedication required for someone to succeed in their weight loss journey. In conclusion, while there have been various speculations about potential surgeries for Rob Kardashian concerning his weight and health, there is no public confirmation or solid evidence indicating that he underwent any specific procedures.

If I tell you that Natural disasters can cause animals to leave their homes, and ask you the question \\"what can cause animals to leave their homes?\\", is the correct answer \\"pesticides\\"? Answer:","output":"The correct answer is not limited to just \\"pesticides.\\" There are several factors that can cause animals to leave their homes, including natural disasters as mentioned in your statement. These factors can be categorized into natural and human-induced causes. Let's explore them in detail. Natural Causes: 1. Natural disasters: As you have mentioned, natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires can force animals out of their natural habitats. These events may destroy their homes, deplete their food sources, and uproot their entire population. 2. Climatic changes: Extreme or sudden changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climatic factors can force animals to migrate in search of more suitable conditions. For instance, during an unusually hot and dry summer, animals may have to move to find water and cooler temperatures. 3. Predation: The presence of predators can be a significant reason for smaller animals to leave their homes. When faced with dangerous predators, animals often have no choice but to abandon their habitats in search of safer grounds. 4. Competition for resources: Animal populations need resources like food, shelter, and space to survive and reproduce. When there is a scarcity of resources or an increase of competition due to the expansion of another species, animals may be forced to find new homes. 5. Disease or parasites: An outbreak of disease or parasites can deplete a population or even wipe it out completely. In such cases, animals may need to leave their homes to escape the disease or infestation and find new healthy populations to join. Human-induced Causes: 1. Pesticides: As per your suggestion, pesticides can indeed cause animals to leave their homes. Widespread application of these toxic chemicals in agriculture and other areas can have disastrous effects on animal populations, forcing them to find new habitats or causing entire species to decline or go extinct. 2. Habitat fragmentation and destruction: Human activities such as deforestation, mining, agriculture, and urbanization can destroy animal habitats and fragment populations, often leaving them no choice but to move to new areas to survive. Fragmentation can also lead to restricted genetic gene flow between population segments and reduced population size, making animals more vulnerable to extinction. 3. Pollution: Air, water, and soil pollution generated by industrial and agricultural activities can contaminate animals' environments, causing them to leave their homes in search of cleaner habitats. 4. Noise pollution: Animals that are sensitive to sound, especially those that rely heavily on sonar or other acoustic communication methods, can be adversely affected by noise pollution. This can disrupt their ability to communicate, navigate, or locate food sources, consequently forcing them to leave their homes. 5. Introduction of invasive species: Sometimes, humans inadvertently introduce foreign species to new habitats. These invasive species can outcompete native species for resources, driving native animals to find new habitats or go extinct. In conclusion, various factors can cause animals to leave their homes. Some of these factors include natural disasters, climatic changes, predation, competition for resources, disease or parasites, pesticides, habitat fragmentation and destruction, pollution, noise pollution, and the introduction of invasive species. While \\"pesticides\\" is one valid answer, it is essential to consider other factors as well, as they all play crucial roles in determining the survival and extent to which animals are forced to abandon their natural habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men?  When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...","output":"The name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men was Perdiccas.

Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks so as not to get overwhelmed. Set achievable goals and deadlines, and remember to celebrate small victories and progress along the way. Communicate with your coworkers or manager if you need help or guidance; they can provide valuable input and support. 2. You feel stressed because you lack concrete sources of energy. It's important to learn how to manage stress effectively, especially when it originates from feeling overwhelmed or under-resourced. Implement self-care practices such as regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet to enhance your energy levels and boost your emotional well-being. Moreover, consider seeking the support of friends, family, or even a counselor who can offer insights and coping techniques to manage stress. 3. You can't figure out how you'll tackle it. In this case, begin by addressing your organization and time management skills. Create a detailed plan of action that outlines specific, achievable objectives, and allocate time efficiently to accomplish these goals. Break tasks into smaller, manageable parts to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Remember to prioritize urgent tasks and utilize tools or resources, such as calendars or to-do lists, to assist with organization. Additionally, consider collaborating with others or seeking advice from those who have faced similar challenges, as they can offer valuable insights and support. 4. You might be working with electrical appliance contractors for a special project. In this scenario, clear communication is key. Make sure to outline your expectations, requirements, and deadlines with the contractor to ensure a mutual understanding and prevent misunderstandings. Keep the lines of communication open with regular check-ins to monitor progress, address issues that arise, and offer feedback to keep the project moving forward efficiently. Maintain a detailed log of the tasks and challenges, as well as the steps you're taking to resolve them. This will not only keep you organized, but also serve as evidence that you're actively working towards overcoming obstacles. In summary, regardless of the specific reason behind feelings of failure, it's crucial to develop a proactive mindset and take constructive action. By breaking down tasks into smaller objectives, prioritizing efficiently, addressing stress and energy levels, seeking support from others, and maintaining clear communication, it's possible to overcome feelings of failure and achieve success in various aspects of life. Stay positive, stay focused, and always strive for improvement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Add spaces: Yourveterinarianwillwantacompletemedicalhistorytodeterminetheunderlyingcauseoftheskinallergies,includingaphysicalexaminationofthedog.","output":"Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history to determine the underlying cause of the skin allergies, including a physical examination of the dog.  When you visit the veterinarian with your dog for possible skin allergies, it is essential to provide them with detailed information to help identify the cause and develop a suitable treatment plan. Here's a breakdown of the different aspects they may want to explore: 1. Complete medical history: The veterinarian will ask about your dog's overall health, previous illnesses, vaccinations, and any treatments or medications they have received. This will help them pinpoint any factors that may be contributing to the skin allergies. 2. Allergy triggers: You should mention any potential allergens your dog might have been exposed to, such as pollen, grass, dust mites, flea bites, or specific foods. It is also crucial to note if the skin allergies seem seasonal since this could provide valuable clues about the allergens involved. 3. Onset and symptoms: Providing accurate information about when the skin allergies first appeared and the symptoms exhibited by your dog, such as itching, redness, inflammation, hair loss, or skin lesions, will help the veterinarian determine the severity of the issue and rule out other possible conditions. 4. Home environment: Describe your dog's living environment, indoor and outdoor activities, bathing and grooming routines, and any recent changes in their lifestyle, such as new products, bedding, or food. This information could help identify allergens present in their surroundings that might have prompted the allergic reaction. 5. Physical examination: The veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination of your dog, focusing on their skin, coat, and overall physical condition. They may also take skin scrapings and hair samples for lab testing to rule out other conditions such as parasites, bacterial or fungal infections, and hormonal imbalances. 6. Allergy testing: If the veterinarian suspects skin allergies resulting from allergen exposure, they might recommend further testing to identify the specific allergens causing the reaction. This could involve blood tests, intradermal skin tests, or elimination diets. Once the underlying cause of the skin allergies has been identified, your veterinarian will develop a customized treatment plan that may include medications, topical treatments, dietary changes, and allergen avoidance strategies. Your dog's progress will be monitored, and the treatment plan may be adjusted as needed to ensure the best possible outcome for your furry companion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Vince had a small rural farm. He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides. Danny was one of his farmer friends, he had a small acreage farm and he practiced permaculture, so no pesticides.  and a hint : In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Please answer this question : Which farmer didn't perform any applications of herbicide as a preventive measure?

Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (December 24, 1905 - April 5, 1976) was an American business magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, film director, and philanthropist, known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. He first made a name for himself as a film producer, and then became an influential figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle--oddities that were caused in part by a worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from several plane crashes, and increasing deafness. As a maverick film tycoon, Hughes gained prominence in Hollywood beginning in the late 1920s, when he produced big-budget and often controversial films like The Racket (1928), Hell's Angels (1930), and Scarface (1932). Beyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful real estate investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in Las Vegas and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.  Originally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., was floated on the New York Stock Exchange under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the \\"original\\" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name \\"Summa\\"--Latin for \\"highest\\"--was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988, Summa announced plans for Summerlin, a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin.  Initially staying in the Desert Inn, Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated 300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the organized crime connected venues. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its Wild West roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city. What hotel did he purchase?","output":"Howard Hughes purchased the Desert Inn hotel.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"These two sentences are not entirely identical in meaning, and the differences can cause confusion. To understand the distinction between them, it is essential to dissect each sentence and analyze their content. In the first sentence: \\"Ali and some of Marwan 's supporters who later became the Khawarij caused a lot of trouble.\\" The subject of this sentence is \\"Ali and some of Marwan's supporters.\\" These individuals later became known as the Khawarij. The sentence implies that both Ali and these supporters were responsible for causing a lot of trouble. Thus, the focus is on Ali and a specific group of Marwan's supporters that transformed into the Khawarij. In the second sentence: \\"A lot of trouble later caused Marwan and some of Ali 's supporters who later became Khawarij.\\" The subject of this sentence is not clear and might be misinterpreted as \\"A lot of trouble.\\" It seems to state that trouble caused Marwan and some of Ali's supporters, who later became Khawarij. The sentence structure is problematic and not equivalent to the first sentence, as it appears to suggest that trouble led to the development of Marwan and these particular supporters. The emphasis is not on the individuals causing trouble but rather on the trouble affecting Marwan and the supporters. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes Ali and some of Marwan's supporters as the agents responsible for causing a lot of trouble, whereas the second sentence is ambiguous, focusing on the trouble that impacted Marwan and Ali's supporters and possibly contributed to their transformation into Khawarij.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Question:   Harry was installing a TV mount. He drills into the wall with a screw that has 20 threads. If he used a screw of the same size with 30 threads, it would take fewer or more turns to put it in?    Paragraph :  The trade-off when the threads are closer together, is that more turns of the screw or bolt are needed to do the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater. Answer:","output":"Using the information from the paragraph, we can conclude that if Harry were to use a screw of the same size with 30 threads instead of the one with 20 threads, it would take more turns to put it in. The reason for this is because when the threads are closer together on a screw, more turns are needed to do the job. The paragraph states that the trade-off when the threads are closer together (as would be the case with the 30-threaded screw compared to the 20-threaded screw) is that a greater number of turns are required to fully install the screw because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater. Simply put, with more threads on the same length of screw, the screw advances a smaller distance into the wall with each turn, which would require more turns overall to accomplish the same depth achieved with the 20-threaded screw. In summary, if Harry used a screw of the same size with 30 threads, it would take more turns to put it in compared to using a screw with 20 threads. This is due to the increased number of threads and the resulting closeness of the threads on the 30-threaded screw, which necessitates a greater number of turns to achieve the same depth as the 20-threaded screw."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses.

Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him.

Paragraph: The Department of Homeland Security said it would issue the sixth waiver of Donald Trump’s presidency under a 2005 law that empowers the secretary to waive reviews required under environmental laws if the border barrier is deemed to be in national security interests. Those laws include the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act. The waiver, which was announced Thursday and published Friday in the Federal Register, helps clear the way for work to begin this month on replacing a second layer of barrier in San Diego, a steel-mesh wall that worked like a fortress when it was built about a decade ago but is now often breached with powerful battery-operated saws sold in home improvement stores. The waivers avoid time-consuming reviews and lawsuits challenging violation of environmental laws. The government awarded a 101 million contract to SLSCO Ltd. of Galveston, Texas, to build a barrier of 30-feet-high steel bollards, with options for an additional 30 million. Work is scheduled to begin this month. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a public notice that the Border Patrol’s San Diego sector is “an area of high illegal entry,” with more than 38,000 arrests and seizures of more than 4 tons (3,600 kilograms) of marijuana and 1,800 pounds (816 kilograms) of cocaine in the 2018 fiscal year. San Diego was the third busiest corridor for illegal crossings among the Border Patrol’s nine sectors along the Mexican border in 2018 after Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and Tucson, Arizona. Work on replacing the first layer of San Diego barrier is nearly complete, also 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) long and made of steel bollards up to 30 feet (9 meters) high. Environmental groups criticized the latest waiver. “Trump is ignoring laws that protect public health and endangered wildlife so he can fulfill a hateful campaign promise,” said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity. “Communities and ecosystems along the border are being upended by this militarization, but Border Patrol won’t even give residents the decency of a public hearing. This is the definition of lawlessness.” President George W. Bush’s administration issued five waivers, paving the way for barriers to blanket about one-third of the border with Mexico. Barack Obama’s administration didn’t issue any waivers. Claim: US to waive environmental reviews for San Diego border wall.","output":"The US Department of Homeland Security announced that it would issue the sixth waiver of Donald Trump's presidency, allowing for environmental reviews to be bypassed for the San Diego border wall construction. This waiver falls under a 2005 law that enables the secretary to waive mandatory reviews under environmental laws if the border barrier is considered essential for national security. The laws in question include the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act. The waiver facilitates the commencement of work on replacing the second layer of barrier in San Diego, ultimately avoiding delays caused by lengthy reviews and legal challenges regarding violations of environmental laws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The Islamic State group says it carried out bomb attacks in the Syrian capital Damascus and the city of Homs, which left at least 140 people dead.\\" Article:","output":"Title: ISIS Takes Responsibility for Deadly Bombings in Damascus and Homs Intro: The world was rocked by more horrifying news on February 21 as devastating bomb attacks occurred in the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the city of Homs, claiming more than 140 lives. The Islamic State (ISIS) has since claimed responsibility for the day's carnage and has incited fear and terror in the hearts of countless Syrians and the international community. Background: The Islamic State group, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Daesh in Arabic, has been a severe threat to global security since its inception in 2013. The extremist terrorist group, which originated in Iraq, aims to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq, Syria, and beyond. They have used brutal tactics, executed mass killings, and committed acts of international terrorism that have alarmed nations worldwide. The Situation in Syria: Syria has been mired in civil war since 2011 when peaceful protests calling for political reforms escalated into armed conflict. The situation rapidly deteriorated and created an environment ripe for the emergence of extremist groups like ISIS. As of today, numerous combatants are fighting for control over the country, including ISIS, the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad, and various other opposition forces. The Bombings in Damascus and Homs: On February 21, 2016, ISIS carried out a series of coordinated bomb attacks in the historically significant cities of Damascus and Homs. In the southern district of Homs, two car bombings occurred in a predominantly Alawite neighborhood, killing at least 57 people and wounding many. The Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam, are seen as supporters of President Bashar al-Assad's government, making them a target for ISIS-led attacks. Around 200 kilometers away, in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus, four explosions, including two suicide bombings and two car bombings, left the area devastated. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 83 people were killed, and over 170 were injured. This area is particularly significant as it is home to a Shia shrine, which attracts numerous Shia Muslim pilgrims each year. ISIS specifically targeted these religious sites, aiming to incite sectarian tensions and fuel the existing conflict. The Response and International Implications: The international community swiftly condemned the attacks in Syria, expressing sympathy for the victims and their families. The United Nations and various governments reaffirmed their commitment to supporting international efforts to combat terrorism and restore peace in Syria. These attacks have prompted increased calls among world powers to resolve the Syrian conflict and stem the rise of violent extremist groups like ISIS. The peace talks in Geneva and the concerted action against terrorism demonstrate the willingness of nations to cooperate in efforts to end the war and counter extremism. Additionally, the role of regional actors, such as Russia, Iran, and Turkey, is critical in shaping the future of Syria and ensuring stability in the region. Conclusion: The recent bombings in Damascus and Homs have reaffirmed the pervasive threat posed by the Islamic State group and the urgent need for action. The international community must combine resources and efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria and weaken the strength of extremist groups like ISIS. Only then can the people of Syria and the world hope for a respite from the violence and upheaval that has become all too common in recent years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP strategist donates to Alabama Democrat McConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees Brent Budowsky: A plea to Alabama voters MORE (R-Ky.) acknowledged late Monday that the chamber’s current approach would fail after two more senators announced opposition to the current healthcare draft.      Without the needed votes, he said, the Senate will take up a repeal-only bill that Congress passed in 2015.      ADVERTISEMENT      “Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\\" McConnell said in a statement.      The repeal-only approach is backed by conservatives, who say Congress should just pass again what it already approved in 2015.      President Trump joined the conservatives, tweeting Monday night: “Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!”      But that bill does not appear to have the votes to pass, and other GOP lawmakers called Monday for working with Democrats or passing an alternative GOP bill.      A separate repeal was the initial GOP strategy at the beginning of this year and ended up being rejected because it lacked the votes to pass.      Too many Republicans wanted to reassure their constituents that there would be a replacement at the same time, aimed at making sure people did not lose coverage.      “There must be a replace with repeal,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) wrote in The Washington Post last week.      In a report that could unsettle moderates, the Congressional Budget Office previously found that the 2015 repeal-only bill would lead to 32 million more uninsured people over a decade, with premiums nearly doubling.      But those concerns did not stop conservatives for calling for a clean repeal vote on Monday night.      “Clean repeal now!” tweeted Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulLexington mayor launches bid for Congress Trump-free Kennedy Center Honors avoids politics Meet the Iran hawk who could be Trump's next secretary of State MORE (R-Ky.).      “Time for full repeal of #Obamacare — let's put the same thing on President Trump's desk that we put on President Obama's desk,” added Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.      In contrast, other Republicans called for working with Democrats on a new plan.      “The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,” Sen. John McCainJohn Sidney McCainGOP strategist donates to Alabama Democrat Meghan McCain knocks Bannon: 'Who the hell are you' to criticize Romney? Dems demand Tillerson end State hiring freeze, consult with Congress MORE (R-Ariz.) said in a statement.      McCain is in Arizona recovering from surgery, which prompted a delay in consideration of the bill this week.      Some Republicans have raised the idea of a bipartisan bill to stabilize ObamaCare markets, which could include funding for key payments to insurers known as cost-sharing reductions and possibly funding to bring down premiums for high-cost enrollees, known as “reinsurance.”      But conservative members, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynMcConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees Air Force makes criminal reporting changes after Texas massacre We need a better pathway for allowing civilians to move guns across state lines MORE (R-Texas), have objected to the idea of a stabilization bill as simply throwing more money at the healthcare law.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell      WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged Monday night that he lacked the votes to pass the Senate health care bill after two more Republican senators came out against it, leaving the party short of a majority.      Instead, he said the Senate would vote on a full repeal of Obamacare, with two years before the repeal goes into effect to allow time to create a new system. The new plan may appear to fulfill a seven-year GOP promise, but it faces extremely difficult odds after many moderate Republican senators have already come out against repeal without an immediate replacement.      Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas and Mike Lee of Utah set the chain of events in motion Monday night when they announced on Twitter that they both would oppose the current bill, which was released just last week.      Moran and Lee followed two other Republican senators who had already said they wouldn't support the bill: Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine.      \\"After conferring with trusted experts regarding the latest version of the Consumer Freedom Amendment, I have decided I cannot support the current version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act,\\" Lee said in a statement. \\"In addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations.\\"      Moran issued this statement: \\"We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy. Furthermore, if we leave the federal government in control of everyday healthcare decisions, it is more likely that our healthcare system will devolve into a single-payer system, which would require a massive federal spending increase. We must now start fresh with an open legislative process to develop innovative solutions that provide greater personal choice, protections for pre-existing conditions, increased access and lower overall costs for Kansans.\\"      The senators released their statements just as eight other lawmakers, including most members of leadership, left the White House, where they ate dinner with the president. President Donald Trump has been largely disengaged from the process in the Senate, and his dinner guests were members already supportive of the measure.      The president responded to the latest development just after 10:15 p.m. ET:      McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, is seeking to give Trump what he wants. McConnell, who had worked to craft the bill that couldn't muster enough support, said he would seek a vote on a full repeal — the same version that passed both the House and the Senate in 2015 — \\"in the coming days.\\"      \\"Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\\" McConnell said in a statement.      While straight repeal passed the Senate in 2015, there was no possibility that it would go into effect because then-President Barack Obama vetoed the legislation.      Just last week, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told reporters that straight repeal wouldn't get the support of 50 Republicans.      McConnell had expected to hold a vote on the bill this week but was forced to delay it after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., underwent surgery to remove a blot clot above his left eye over the weekend. McCain is unable to return to Washington while he recovers, and his vote would have been crucial before the latest defections.      The Better Care Reconciliation Act has hit numerous roadblocks since it was unveiled more than a month ago. The first version fell short of the support needed to pass when at least 10 Republican senators came out against it, forcing McConnell back to the drawing board to try to win the support of moderate and conservative Republicans who opposed the measure for different reasons.      The second iteration, released last week, seemed to have more support. Only Paul and Collins opposed it at the outset, and others with concerns seemed open to ongoing discussions about the bill.      But the coalition of 50 began to crack Monday when Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters that he was concerned about McConnell's reassurance to centrists that Medicaid cuts set to go into effect in 2025 would never be realized.      \\"I did find the story about Leader McConnell's comments about Medicaid reforms just too far in the future probably never being enacted — I found those pretty troubling,\\" Johnson said.      The delay due to McCain's medical emergency didn't help matters, either, as some worried that it would allow more time for opponents to press their efforts. The only polls at measure about 15 percent support, according to public surveys, and Republican Senate offices have been home to nearly daily protests by activists opposed to the Republican plan.      Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans should \\"start from scratch and work with Democrats\\" on a bill to fix problems with Obamacare.      \\"This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable,\\" Schumer said in a statement.      Still, Republican senators are promoting their own ideas on how to move forward.      McCain released a statement saying Republicans should forgo the current process, start over and work with Democrats.      \\"The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,\\" McCain said.      Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., tweeted a link to an opinion piece he wrote, promoting his idea of allowing each state to determine whether Obamacare — or another idea — works for the state. ||||| President Donald Trump's top legislative priority was dealt a potentially fatal blow Monday night as two more Republican senators announced their opposition to the party's health care overhaul.      Trump quickly called on Republicans to simply repeal Obamacare and begin work on a new health care plan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would try to do so.      Story Continued Below      “Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\\" McConnell said.      The Kentucky Republican said he planned to hold a vote in the coming days to take up the House-passed bill to replace the 2010 health care law and then call up an amendment to eliminate major parts of Obamacare, such as the Medicaid expansion, insurance subsidies and fines for the employer and individual mandates.      Republicans passed a similar bill to effectively repeal Obamacare in 2015 under reconciliation — the fast-track budget procedure the GOP is using to thwart a Democratic filibuster — but it was vetoed by President Barack Obama.      McConnell added that the repeal-only bill is \\"what a majority of the Senate has already supported in 2015,\\" but GOP lawmakers have voiced severe doubts that such a plan can win the 50 votes necessary this year given the uncertainty it would throw into insurance markets. The 2015 vote was viewed as mostly symbolic at the time, given Obama’s certain veto.      But after his own caucus tanked McConnell's attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously and at the prodding of the president, the GOP leader is going to force his caucus to go on the record on health care. If the Senate does vote to open debate on the House bill, which is not guaranteed, the repeal-only bill would be the first amendment. But senators would still be able to offer unlimited amendments to the bill, leading the GOP down an uncertain road once the process began.      \\"Republicans should just 'REPEAL' failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\\" Trump tweeted shortly before McConnell's statement came out.      McConnell's announcement followed the news that GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas said they could not support the current bill. They joined Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in opposition, denying GOP leaders the support to even bring the bill to the floor and upending Republicans' seven-year goal of repealing Obamacare. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is recovering from surgery, issued a statement advising the party to start over with a bipartisan approach.

The party has spent nearly seven months on a health care overhaul, with hopes it would ease the path to tax reform. Now Trump and the GOP-led Congress are staring at an impending August recess with no major legislative achievements in hand.      At a dinner with GOP senators on Monday evening, Trump said the party would look like “dopes” if they couldn’t pass the bill after passing a repeal bill in 2015.      “If the Republicans have the House, Senate and the presidency and they can't pass this health care bill, they are going to look weak,” Trump said, according to a source familiar with the meeting. “How can we not do this after promising it for years?”      Trump had no idea defections were coming Monday night, according to another White House official with knowledge of the meeting. \\"Why would we have a dinner like that if we knew people were going to drop out?\\" the official said.      Even before Lee and Moran's announcement, there were increasingly urgent signs that the GOP's 52-seat majority was too fragile to pass the bill, which would scale back Medicaid spending and Obamacare's insurance subsidies. The vote was already delayed because of McCain's surgery, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) had fumed that McConnell had committed a \\"breach of trust\\" in selling the bill to moderates.      Still, just minutes before Moran’s and Lee's statements, aides were toiling to revise the bill so it could win the support of 50 Republican senators.      But with Collins and Paul already in opposition, the conservative Lee and typically pragmatic Moran held hands and became the deciding votes in opposition to McConnell's latest plan.      Moran criticized the closed-door process for developing the bill and criticized the legislation for not repealing the entire 2010 health care law, concluding that \\"We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy.\\" Lee said the latest bill \\"doesn’t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations.\\"      Democrats, meanwhile, celebrated. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that the \\"second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable.\\"      The announcement from Lee and Moran is just the latest in a long series of obstacles for the Obamacare repeal effort. McConnell pulled a vote on a previous version of the bill last month after skeptical Republicans came out against the plan.      Johnson was stunned to read in The Washington Post that McConnell was privately arguing that major reforms to Medicaid were so far in the distance that they would never take effect. Johnson said Monday that he’d confirmed through conversations with other senators that McConnell had made the remarks.      “The reported comments from Leader McConnell before last Thursday about ‘don’t worry about these Medicaid changes, they won’t take effect,’ that’s troubling to me. I have talked to senators that basically confirmed that. I’ll see what Leader McConnell says tomorrow,” Johnson said on Monday evening. “From my standpoint, it’s a pretty serious breach of trust, those comments. I’m just troubled by those comments.”      In response to Johnson's complaints, McConnell said, “I prefer to speak for myself, and my view is that the Medicaid per capita cap with a responsible growth rate that is sustainable for taxpayers is the most important long-term reform in the bill. That is why it has been in each draft we have released.”      Before Lee and Moran announced their opposition, more than a half-dozen key senators were undecided, many wavering over those cuts to Medicaid spending.      “I’m reserving judgment. I want a CBO score, analysis and we’re still doing more work on it,” said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). “They need more time … we’re still working on it.”      The effort stalled over the weekend as McCain's office announced the Arizona Republican, and his vote, would be away from Washington for at least a week.      GOP leaders had hoped he would return in a week and they could start work on the bill.      “We’re not going to come up short,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) had said earlier in the day. \\"We need a full contingent of the Republican senators. We don’t have any to spare.”      Trump had also ramped up his outreach to the Hill — hosting a handful of GOP senators at the White House dinner Monday night, including Cornyn, John Thune of South Dakota, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Steve Daines of Montana and James Lankford of Oklahoma, according to Republican aides.      Key swing-vote senators such as Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Johnson were not attending. Neither did Lee nor Moran.      And a charm offensive from the Trump administration aimed at skeptical GOP governors seemed to have little impact over the weekend.      “Governors have a large say. The reason why we’re not at 50 right now is a lot of governors don’t like what we’re doing,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is pitching them on his own plan to block grant federal health care money to the states and keep all of Obamacare’s taxes.      Several senators had also raised questions about an amendment from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), which would allow cheap plans to be sold alongside Obamacare-compliant plans that cover pre-existing conditions. Those plans’ premiums would have some subsidies, but senators were confused about whether that money would be drawn from a nearly 200 billion stabilization fund meant to woo moderates. They had hoped to use the time to further modify the bill.      But extra time cut both ways.      “The delay is what we have,” Alexander said earlier Monday. “So I don’t think we’ll know until we vote whether it’s been good or bad.”      Tara Palmeri, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report. |||||","output":"The Republican party's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, have hit a significant roadblock as two more senators announced their opposition to the current healthcare draft.

The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

The attack took place at about 05:30 (02:30 GMT) in the remote Rukban area, a few hundred metres from the camp. A number of other vehicles involved in the attack were destroyed. It is not yet clear who carried out the attack, but the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has threatened in the past to \\"break down\\" Jordan's borders. The kingdom is part of the US-led coalition against IS and has carried out air strikes on militants in Syria. Tuesday's attack, the first of its kind since the conflict in Syria began in 2011, saw an explosives-laden vehicle blown up beside a military post. The blast left four border guards and two personnel from the Civil Defence and Public Security Department dead, a military statement said. \\"Such criminal act will only add to our unshaken determination to fight terrorism and terrorists' ideologies regardless of their motives,\\" it added. Earlier this month, Jordanian intelligence service officers and two other employees were killed in a Palestinian refugee camp near the capital, Amman, in what the government said was a terrorist attack. The Rukban camp is located beside an earthen berm in the desert, about 8km (5 miles) west of the point at which the Iraq, Syria, and Jordan borders meet. The rocky area is devoid of shade, water or vegetation and is far from any towns. Aid workers say more than 50,000 refugees are stranded at the camp, living in deplorable conditions while awaiting entry to Jordan. UN satellite analysts mapped more than 6,400 probable shelters in the area in late April. The Jordanian authorities currently only allow in about 50 to 100 refugees each day, citing security concerns. Many of the refugees are believed to have fled areas controlled by IS in eastern Homs province and neighbouring Raqqa, where forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have made gains in the past year with the support of Russian air strikes. Thousands of other refugees are stranded at another tented camp on the border at Hadalat, about 90km west of Rukban, where the UN mapped 1,900 shelters. The UN acknowledged in December that Jordan had legitimate security concerns, but called on the country to allow all the refugees at the two camps to enter. Jordan is hosting 655,000 of the 4.84 million Syrians registered as refugees with the UN.

In July 1946, which hotel in Jerusalem was bombed by Jewish terrorists because it was the HQ of the British administration?","output":"In July 1946, the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed by Jewish terrorists because it housed the headquarters of the British administration in Palestine. This attack was orchestrated by a Zionist paramilitary organization known as Irgun Zvai Leumi, or simply Irgun. The King David Hotel bombing took place on July 22, 1946, and resulted in the deaths of 91 people and the wounding of 46 others. The victims included British, Arab, and Jewish civilians, as well as British government officials and military personnel. The Irgun was a militant Zionist group established in 1931, seeking to establish a Jewish state in Palestine by using all means, including violence, against the British Mandate authorities and local Arab populations. The group, led by Menachem Begin, who later became Israel’s Prime Minister, aimed to force the British government to change its policies towards the Jewish community in Palestine. At the time, the British administration was headquartered in the southern wing of the King David Hotel. The hotel also housed the offices of the British Mandatory authorities, including the Secretariat and the British Army Headquarters. The attack on the King David Hotel was meticulously planned and involved the smuggling of explosives into the building over a period of weeks. The Irgun operatives disguised themselves as Arab workers and managed to conceal the explosives in milk churns. On the day of the bombing, they placed these churns in the hotel's basement, which was situated directly under the British Secretariat's offices. They then called a warning to the hotel, urging the British to evacuate the building before the explosion occurred. Despite the warning, the British authorities did not fully evacuate the hotel, as they believed it might be a hoax. Ultimately, the explosion was massive, destroying a significant portion of the hotel and causing serious casualties. The King David Hotel bombing marked a turning point in the fight for the establishment of a Jewish state. The scale of the destruction and the high number of casualties led to widespread outrage and condemnation, both within Palestine and internationally. The attack strained relations between the British administration and the Jewish Agency, the main political body representing the Jewish community in Palestine. Additionally, it contributed to the intensification of violence in the region, as well as increasing international pressure on Britain to find a solution to the ongoing conflict in Palestine. In the years that followed, the United Nations developed a plan to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, ultimately leading to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. The legacy of the King David Hotel bombing continues to be felt in Israel and forms a significant part of its complex and difficult history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on \\"a mental illness that may originate before birth\\" Text:","output":"Title: The Origins of Mental Illness: Prenatal Factors and Implications Introduction The understanding and acknowledgment of mental illnesses have become increasingly significant in recent decades, particularly as society at large becomes more cognizant of their prevalence and consequences. Various mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders, have demonstrated links to both environmental and genetic factors. A particularly thought-provoking area of study is the possibility that some mental illnesses may originate before birth, influenced by factors during prenatal development. This text aims to explore the potential origins of mental illnesses before birth, highlighting the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that can come into play. Genetic Factors The role of genetics in the development of mental illnesses is a widely researched subject. Mental health conditions often run in families, suggesting that hereditary traits may predispose certain individuals to these disorders. Experts estimate that genetic factors may contribute to up to 80% of the risk for certain illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Specific gene mutations have been identified in connection to numerous mental health conditions, including those related to serotonin transporters, dopamine receptors, and glutamate pathways. Moreover, copy number variations, wherein sections of the genome are either deleted or duplicated, have been linked to an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders. It is important to note, however, that mental illnesses are often polygenic, meaning that several genes likely contribute to the development of the disorder, instead of just one isolated gene. Epigenetic Factors Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in gene expression or function that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. The connection between prenatal development and mental health is becoming increasingly clear as a result of investigations into epigenetic factors. Stress, malnutrition, and exposure to particular environmental factors during pregnancy can lead to epigenetic modifications in the fetus's genetic material. These alterations are often long-lasting and can impact an individual's mental health later in life. For instance, maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring. Similarly, maternal malnutrition, particularly a lack of folic acid and other essential vitamins and minerals, has been correlated with an increased risk for schizophrenia and other cognitive disorders in children. Environmental Factors Various environmental factors that a pregnant woman is exposed to may also have a significant impact on the mental health of the child. Exposure to infections during pregnancy, such as Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, and influenza, has been linked to a heightened risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in offspring. Furthermore, exposure to neurotoxic substances, like lead or alcohol, can also pose significant risks to a developing fetus, potentially resulting in cognitive impairments or neurodevelopmental disorders like fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Another critical environmental factor is the prenatal exposure to maternal stress or trauma. Research has shown that excessive amounts of stress hormones may disrupt the development of the fetus's nervous system, leading to an increased likelihood of mental health issues later in life. Conclusion In conclusion, current research provides strong evidence to support the notion that the origins of mental illnesses may be traced back to prenatal development. A complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, such as gene mutations, maternal stress, and exposure to toxins or infections, can contribute to the development of mental health disorders before birth. Understanding and addressing these risk factors during pregnancy is crucial to enhanced mental health outcomes in future generations. However, it is important to note that mental illnesses often arise from a combination of genetic, environmental, and social influences. Thus, a broader perspective that considers postnatal experiences is vital for developing holistic approaches to mental health."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

A significant point of contention for the reviewer is the waiting time for their food. They mention having to wait for 30 minutes, which was deemed excessive given the simplicity of their order.

Please answer the following question: This article: De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help.

The terrorists' Answer:","output":"Title: Countdown to Chaos Genre: Action-Thriller Plot: In the year 2025, the United States and key allies face a rising terrorist threat from an extremist group calling themselves 'The Defenders of Purity' who aim to bring down Western governments and establish a new world order. As their attacks grow bolder and more deadly, Western leaders, including the President of the United States, Joseph Hanson, and his team are scrambling to uncover the true motives behind the terrorist plot to stop them before it's too late. The Defenders of Purity are relentless in their pursuit, wreaking havoc on major cities around the world, targeting symbols of wealth, power, and influence. While the world is drowning in fear and confusion, President Hanson receives an anonymous tip about a possible mole within his administration, someone who could provide invaluable information about the terrorist group's next move. Determined to stop the terrorists and expose the traitor, President Hanson assembles a top-secret task force comprised of his most trusted advisors and intelligence experts. However, the more they dig into the terrorists' plot, the more complex and twisted it becomes, leading them to question if there are other forces at play behind the group's radical agenda. The deadline is rapidly approaching as the group's ultimate plan is set into motion: simultaneous attacks on key military installations, government buildings, and key infrastructure, triggering chaos and anarchy on a scale never seen before. As President Hanson and his team race against time to decipher the terrorists' web of deceit, they uncover a chilling truth: a foreign power is pulling the strings of The Defenders of Purity, using them as a pawn in a deadly game of global domination. With the clock ticking and the nation's capital under a direct threat of destruction, President Hanson and his team face a difficult choice: take down the terrorists while risking their lives or sacrifice their own people for a chance at peace. In a high-stakes, heart-pounding finale, President Hanson leads his team on a covert mission to dismantle The Defenders of Purity's' stronghold and foil their destructive plot. Along the way, they expose the government mole and manage to intercept and eliminate the foreign power orchestrating the chaos. In the aftermath of the attacks, President Hanson emerges as a champion for democracy, leading a renewed global effort to combat terrorism and maintain the stability of the world order. As a result, The Defenders of Purity are dismantled, and peace is restored, leaving a lasting impact on the world for generations to come. The movie ends with the message that unity and trust are key to defeating such heinous terrorist plots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is located between two peaks called the North and South Guardian Angels , deep within the Left Fork of North Creek . It is part of the larger Great West Canyon system , which includes both the Left and Right Forks of North Creek . The Subway is so named for its tube - like , undercut slot canyons . This segment of canyon is less than 0.25 miles ( 0.40 km ) in length , but long approach and exit hikes are necessary for access .  - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast.  - Mesa (Portuguese and Spanish for \\"table\\") is the American English term for tableland, an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep cliffs. It takes its name from its characteristic table-top shape. It may also be called a table hill, table-topped hill or table mountain. It is larger than a butte, which it otherwise resembles closely.  - Zion Canyon (also called Little Zion, Mukuntuweap, Mu-Loon'-Tu-Weap, and Straight Cañon; \\"weap\\" is Paiute for canyon) is a deep and narrow gorge in southwestern Utah, United States, carved by the North Fork of the Virgin River. Nearly the entire canyon is located within the western half of Zion National Park.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - A slot canyon is a narrow canyon, formed by the wear of water rushing through rock. A slot canyon is significantly deeper than it is wide. Some slot canyons can measure less than across at the top but drop more than to the floor of the canyon.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (from the - \\"cheir\\", \\"hand\\" and - \\"pteron\\", \\"wing\\") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits, which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium.  - The Southwestern United States (also known as the American Southwest) is a region of the United States which includes Arizona, the western portion of New Mexico, bordered on the east by the Llano Estacado, southern Colorado and Utah below the 39th parallel, the \\"horn\\" of Texas below New Mexico, the southernmost triangle of Nevada, and the most southeastern portion of California, which encompasses the Mojave and Colorado Deserts.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - The Mojave Desert is an arid rain-shadow desert and the driest desert in North America. It is located in the southwestern United States, primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada, and it occupies a total of . Very small areas also extend into Utah and Arizona. Its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of Joshua trees, which are native only to the Mojave Desert and are considered an indicator species, and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants. The central part of the desert is sparsely populated, while its peripheries support large communities such as Las Vegas, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, and St. George.  - A natural arch, natural bridge or, less commonly, a rock arch is a natural rock formation where an arch has formed with an opening underneath. Natural arches commonly form where inland cliffs, coastal cliffs, fins or stacks are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes).  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering.  - Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest summit in Zion National Park, in Utah. Located in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, it rises above Camp Creek to the north and Taylor Creek to the south.  - The Life Zone concept was developed by C. Hart Merriam in 1889 as a means of describing areas with similar plant and animal communities. Merriam observed that the changes in these communities with an increase in latitude at a constant elevation are similar to the changes seen with an increase in elevation at a constant latitude.  - Springdale is a town in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 529 at the 2010 census. It is located immediately outside the boundaries of Zion National Park, and is oriented around the resulting tourist industry. It was originally settled as a Mormon farming community in 1862 by evacuees from the flooding of nearby Northrop. Springdale was named one of the 20 'prettiest towns' in the United States by Forbes Traveler in 2008.  - A butte is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller than mesas, plateaus, and table landforms. The word butte comes from a French word meaning \\"small hill\\"; its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where \\"mesa\\" is also used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas.  In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.  - Navajo Sandstone is a geologic formation in the Glen Canyon Group that is spread across the U.S. states of southern Nevada, northern Arizona, northwest Colorado, and Utah as part of the Colorado Plateau province of the United States.  - Zion National Park is located in the Southwestern United States, near Springdale, Utah. A prominent feature of the park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to half a mile (800 m) deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest elevation is at Coalpits Wash and the highest elevation is at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park's unique geography and variety of life zones allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches.  - The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km (130,000 mi) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries.  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests.   - The Great Basin is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds in North America. It is noted for both its arid climate and the basin and range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than away at the summit of Mount Whitney. The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes/ecoregions, and deserts.  - The Virgin River is a tributary of the Colorado River in the U.S. states of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The river is about long. It was designated Utah's first wild and scenic river in 2009, during the centennial celebration of Zion National Park.

Summarize this article: TV Weekend: The Bootleg Empire of Ken Burns' Prohibition      There may be nothing more gratifying and unifying for people than coming together in disdain for a past idea, now universally agreed on to be stupid. One of the greatest of these in American history is alcohol prohibition, not merely the impetus for the criminal events of Boardwalk Empire, but the case study for the idea that the best way to encourage a personal vice is to forbid it. So for fans of Boardwalk (though its viewership was down from its season 1 premiere) or students of American history, Ken Burns' Prohibition, airing three nights on PBS starting Sunday, provides a detailed, engaging postmortem of a very, very bad idea.      One problem I've sometimes had with Burns' documentaries in the past, as I've written before, is that they represent a kind of pledge-drive-safe advocacy: they make impassioned arguments for things the audience already believes. (Slavery was awful, war is hell, baseball represents America.) This is the tradeoff, I guess, for the big platform that PBS provides him. And I'm not sure that three nights of Prohibition would be of that much use if all it did was let us shake our heads for about six hours at America's 14 years of dry madness.      That's why, from my barstool, the best night of Prohibition--if you watch only one--is the first, on Sunday, which looks at how Prohibition became law, and the reasons that most American states were motivated to sign on to what, in retrospect, looks like an impossible attempt at social engineering. It wasn't that Americans of the time were simply moralistic prigs and stupider than we are. As Prohibition--based on a book by longtime TIME editor Daniel Okrent--lays out, there were strong motives behind a very bad constitutional amendment.      Namely: America was drunk off its ass. And it could be a very, very mean drunk. This situation was different from drinking culture as we think of it today, and Prohibition does an engaging job giving it historical context. When the U.S. was founded, regular drinking was a way of life; not just drinking in the evenings for entertainment, but throughout the day--for thirst, for sustenance, as a way of conserving harvests like apples into cider. The practice goes back centuries; in the pre-industrial world, beer or cider might simply be a safer, more reliable option than water.      But the drink of those times was different from today; the founding fathers' beer would have had a far lower alcohol content than what you'd get in a microbrew today. This changed, though, with the development of industrial technology and the growth of America. Suddenly, the country was turning out corn, grain--the raw stuff of hard liquor--and had the means to distill a lot of it en masse. Average Americans now had easy access to far harder booze--by many multiple of alcohol content--than they did in more agrarian times. Americans of the mid-19th century drank three times as much alcohol as we do today.      As Prohibition tells it, the country spent much of the 19th century plastered--and paid for it in money, lost jobs and domestic violence. (One of the catchphrases of the early Prohibition movement, related to the early women's rights movement, was \\"the degradation of Saturday night,\\" that is, men going out, spending their paychecks on hard liquor, and coming home to beat their kids and brutally rape their wives.)      A confluence of factors--the Progressive movement, religious awakenings--served to make banning alcohol a realistic possibility and then a reality. And yes, it turned out to be as awful and fruitless an effort as you'd think, as the following two nights spell out in interesting detail. (Though the material is much closer to the story that Boardwalk tells and the themes you'd expect from a prohibition film--the rise of crime, the spread of speakeasies, the way banning something makes people want it more.)      But Prohibition goes on to say that trying to make America dry was also a case of zealous overreach, which you could apply to any number of political movements and well-intentioned programs. The supporters of prohibition turned the ban into something much more draconian than many of the politicians who voted for it expected. Many \\"supporters\\" of prohibition assumed that beer and light-alcohol wine would still be legal, for instance. But the Volstead Act put the alcohol threshold so low, Okrent notes, as to technically criminalize sauerkraut.      The result was a law too sweeping to practically enforce and too rigid for most Americans to respect. Without respect, the law could not take hold, and it had the unintended consequence of not just giving rise to modern organized crime, but encouraging the hedonism of the Jazz Age. Dry America overnight became the world's largest importer of cocktail shakers. As historian Catherine Gilbert Murdock argues in the film, prohibition backers might have built more support if they got rid of the more ridiculous parts of the Volstead Act. Instead, they stuck by it in their extremism, losing any moderate support. \\"That's an important political lesson,\\" she says. \\"You've gotta bend a little.\\"      There, of course, is a lesson you could easily apply today, though Burns does not push the viewer to apply it to any one faction in particular. In an interview with Burns on Current, Keith Olbermann put a more specific point on it--comparing anti-alcohol zealots with today's conservatives--though Burns notes that prohibition was an alliance of conservative moralists and progessive advocates of the time alike:      In any case, it's a worthy, well, distillation of the documentary's theme: if there's one thing more dangerous than getting drunk on whiskey, it's getting drunk on righteousness. ||||| In the 91 years since the 18th Amendment went into effect, the wonderment surrounding this event has never faded. How, in the United States of America, the land of the free, could Prohibition ever have come to be?      For answering that question alone—which Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's \\"Prohibition\\" do in a remarkable first episode—the series would have to be considered a triumph. The story begins with a look at 19th-century America, and at the lives of the obscure, often desperate, Americans—mostly women—who were the... ||||| It's a great subject with many present-day echoes, as the war on drugs ever more loudly raises questions of legislated morality, missed tax revenues and business opportunities created for bad people. As television, it also dovetails, historically, with \\"Boardwalk Empire,\\" whose second season has just begun and, analogously, with \\"Breaking Bad,\\" which is, after all, the story of a bootlegger.With co-director Lynn Novick, his collaborator on \\"The War,\\" Burns tells his story in three chapters, \\"A Nation of Drunkards,\\" \\"A Nation of Scofflaws\\" and \\"A Nation of Hypocrites,\\" locally airing Sunday through Tuesday on PBS SoCal/KOCE. At something more than five hours, \\"Prohibition,\\" while interesting from moment to moment, is longer than it needs to be, and made even longer by Burns' habitual stateliness. (It's easy to imagine him telling narrator Peter Coyote to \\"take that line just a little slower.\\")I prefer this approach to the machine-gun pacing of many modern documentaries, but it doesn't fit every subject equally well — \\"Baseball,\\" yes, \\"Jazz,\\" no — and, as it often does here, can make the material feel remotely historical instead of bringing it to life. (It can also squeeze the humor from his texts.) And though, as the best-known documentary filmmaker of his time, Burns has both the prestige and the resources to acquire a remarkable wealth of visual material, it does not necessarily help his story to use it all.Prohibition did not begin on a whim, certainly: We learn that by 1830 \\"the average American over 15 drank the equivalent of 88 bottles of whiskey a year\\" — you can see how that might lead to a temperance movement. It was in many ways a progressive movement, tied to female suffrage, even as it was a movement that also demonized immigrants, their cultures and drinking habits. But the Volstead Act, the instrument that transformed the 18th Amendment from a general ban into particular law — \\"a law that would imprison Jesus if he turned water into wine,\\" in the words of talking head Pete Hamill — was to be finally not an instrument of sobriety but the starting gun for a national binge that lasted from January 1920 until December 1933, when the 21st Amendment voided the 18th. By one count there were some 32,000 speakeasies operating in New York City at the height of Prohibition; the word \\"scofflaw\\" was coined to describe their innumerable patrons.As usual, Burns largely uses individual case histories to tell his tale. Here is Carrie Nation with her ax, busting up saloons. There is Al Capone with his bulletproof Cadillac, a \\"Prohibition businessman\\" signing autographs and gracing the cover of Time. \\"I got nothing against the honest cop on the beat,\\" he said. \\"You just have them transferred someplace they can't do you any harm.\\" In reality, Capone's Chicago was, as even Lucky Luciano , visiting from New York, described it, \\"a crazy place. Nobody's safe in the street.\\"The drama might flag or grow diffuse, but there is still a lot here to learn. Of the talking heads, the most consistently valuable resources are Hamill and Daniel Okrent, who was also featured in \\"Baseball\\" and whose 2010 book \\"Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition\\" would seem to be the rock on which \\"Prohibition\\" is built.And yet, despite the presence of a few witnesses old enough to recall the time, \\"Prohibition\\" lacks a voice as vibrant as that of Shelby Foote in \\"The Civil War\\" or Buck O'Neil in \\"Baseball,\\" or the reminiscing soldiers and sailors of \\"The War.\\" It remains for Coyote's measured narration, written by frequent Burns collaborator Geoffrey C.

That looks pretty good, you might think to yourself, and are meant to. ||||| Honoring the Volstead Act’s ultimate lesson, I now forbid you to watch “Prohibition,” Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s latest epic historical documentary. Which will, of course, have the reverse effect of making you want to watch it even more. That’s “Prohibition’s” lone and oft-repeated take-away: Americans don’t like being told what to do.      The 18th Amendment, which banned the sale of alcoholic beverages between 1920 and 1933, was a disastrous experiment in government attempting to enforce morals, and it was, in the opinion of “Prohibition’s” many historians and cultural critics, the only time the Constitution was used as a way to limit freedom instead of promote it.      Viewers who stay for all five-plus hours of “Prohibition” will stagger away filled but not necessarily satisfied. The era is ripe with many historical-social corollaries and outcomes, and it could not be a more tailor-made subject for America’s Greatest Documentarian. Prohibition is inextricably linked to politics, the suffrage movement, religion, the South, civil rights, immigration, jazz — just a few of Burns’s favorite things. It is packed with bigger-than-life characters who left behind a lot of stirring words and a surplus of photographs and movies. If this documentary were made of alcohol, it could be chugged out of beer bongs at a Ken Burns frat-house blowout.      Some viewers will — and should — stop after a sip or two. Those of us who have watched Burns’s many masterly works over the years will recognize the trademark moves: the graceful pan-’n’-scan over archival photos and documents; the surprise treat of high-end celebrity voices reading bits of correspondence and arguments; the soundtrack choices resonating into redundance.      Burns’s fans will also await a magical moment that almost always occurs in his work: The epic scope of it eventually takes hold and you become far more absorbed in the subject than you ever thought possible; it’s a moment when you stop to realize that you are learning.      Women spurred the early temperance campaigns but eventually led the movement to end Prohibition, after its failures became obvious. A ‘Crusader’ poses in 1930. (Library of Congress/PBS)      This has happened to me with his now-legendary takes on baseball and jazz — two subjects I’m not opposed to but also not naturally obsessed with. Once you’re in — once Burns has you hooked — you’re in for the long haul. I got to the end of 2007’s “The War” with something akin to the tingling high that marathon finishers must feel. I even stayed in for the whole of 2009’s “The National Parks: America’s Best Idea,” which was too long by half.      Burns has the similar gift of that rare history professor who can captivate even the most reluctant student by bringing the material to life. Thus, he is much beloved all across campus by everyone except other history profs. His tenure is unassailable.      Which makes me sad to note the long stretches of sober boredom in the middle of “Prohibition,” even though it is short (three nights, beginning Sunday) by Burns’s standards. At one point, I considered watching the documentary while drunk, to see if it improved. (It might help my writing, too.)      “Prohibition” draws on journalist Daniel Okrent’s comprehensive 2010 book, “Last Call.” Part 1 is called “A Nation of Drunkards,” and it is by far the best part of the project, exploring the nation’s colonial and pioneer dependency on booze, which was terrifying. When admiring our forebears’ survivalist resolve, we have to admit just how drunk they were on a daily basis. “Prohibition” eloquently grieves the toll this took on women and children, who lived in the fearful presence of abusive men who drank three times as much as today’s casual imbibers. The degree to which the United States drank in the 18th and 19th centuries is simply astonishing and goes a long way to explain the forces from which the temperance effort emerged, as well as the moral logic behind it.      The second episode — “A Nation of Scofflaws” — loses steam just when the buzz of it all should really kick in. As a smart publicity move, “Prohibition” has attempted to ally itself with the freshly arrived (and suprisingly vigorous) second season of HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire,” which is set in Atlantic City during Prohibition. The two seem to be a natural fit, appealing to viewers who will never tire of stories about mob violence. The prohibition portion of “Prohibition” — the gangsters and crime and dirty politics — should be the most exciting part, describing what it was like on the day the booze flow stopped in 1920 and a criminal network immediately rose from grass-roots moonshiners to a deadly cartel that controlled shipping and handling.      Thanks to the emerging prevalence of movie cameras by then, Burns and his trusted collaborator, Novick, make use of much footage — too much — that shows men with picks and axes hacking away at barrels of beer and grain alcohol. Again and again and again. The talking heads begin to drone on, less profound this time, not brimming with the same wonder seen in the experts Burns has assembled in the past.      It’s rare for Burns and Novick to get lost in their own material, but it happens here. In trying to show the reach of Prohibition, the film gets distracted by the era’s many parallels. At one point, it could have just as easily been a fascinating documentary about sexual liberation. At another point, it could be a movie about the American economy and the Great Depression. (Next up for Burns and company, by the way, is a project due next year called “The Dust Bowl.”) All of it is relevant, but none of it quite coheres.      If Parts 2 and 3 (“A Nation of Hypocrites”) could have somehow been as revealing as Part 1, then “Prohibition” might have equaled “Jazz” and “Baseball.” Something I always long for in Burns’s project is something he avoids on principle, which is to link the past to the pres­ent. His sense of denouement and epilogue always feels hurried and tacked on — in “Prohibition’s” case, this means a quick nod to such movements as Alcoholics Anonymous but no correlation to “just say no,” the drug wars, the Mexican cartels or the effort to legalize marijuana. In our current cultural and political skirmishes we often gravitate toward legislative impulses that would force one person’s morality on another, but Burns isn’t going there. He is never about the now.      Better, then, to focus one’s 1920s fixations on the dark duplicity and bitter heart of “Boardwalk Empire,” which is two episodes into what looks to be an even better season than the first.      The preoccupying arc this time is to make Steve Buscemi’s Enoch “Nucky” Thompson’s life a little more hellish as he staves off bootlegging competition and personal betrayal from all sides. To its array of lowlifes, “Boardwalk Empire” has added the Ku Klux Klan and is giving intriguing dimension to my favorite character, Margaret Schroeder, played by Kelly Macdonald. Charlie Cox (Ishmael from Encore’s recent “Moby Dick”) has joined the cast as Owen Slater, an Irish tough with a charming smile.      “Boardwalk Empire” gets so gravely serious, and its men are so thuggishly repugnant by design, that a smile like Owen’s goes a long way toward adding some spark. “Boardwalk Empire” is doing what I wish “Prohibition” had done — it’s tempting me to stick around for one more.      Prohibition      (five hours over three nights) begins Sunday at 8 p.m. on WETA and MPT. Parts 2 and 3 air Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.      Boardwalk Empire      (one hour) airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO. ||||| What should a PBS viewer pour himself to enhance his enjoyment of Prohibition (PBS, Sunday through Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET)? In posing the question, I don't mean to suggest that this documentary, directed by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, needs any help to go down easy. But it seems correct to celebrate the freedom to get one's buzz on. The freedom is, of course, vastly more important than the buzz itself, as Prohibition notes in its closing words. Here, the writer Pete Hamill, one talking head among a distinguished roster, says that he has hasn't had a drink in three decades. But, hypothetically, he'd be proud to touch the stuff again in a public protest against any legislative attempt to deny his fellow citizens that right.            So what to pour? Whiskey—the excessive consumption of which, in the 1800s, provided an early impetus for temperance organization—is a fine choice. You could also mix up a cocktail called the scofflaw. In a nifty aside, the documentary mentions that the word was coined to denote the very common criminals who kept boozing after the Last Night. Watery domestic beer would also work; passage of the 18th Amendment became possible partly because of the World War I-era vilification of German-Americans, some of whom had names like Pabst and Schlitz and Anheuser and Busch. Want to concoct something in your bathtub? Terrific. The notes of Soft Scrub in the bouquet will impart historically accurate odors.            Over three nights and five and half hours, Prohibition provides a very fine analytic survey of the noble experiment, and most criticisms of it are quibbles. However, if you are the type of viewer who, after The Civil War and Baseball, gets ticked off by certain Burnsian tics of style, then consider yourself warned. I mean, when the film recounts the moment that Carrie Nation received a message from God to vandalize saloons, a reading of her words plays over an image of yellow sunlight gracing a rural cobweb. There are a couple of corny re-creations of phone calls placed by the blockbuster bootlegger Roy Olmstead to his accomplices. But these seem a small price to pay for the delights of the series' archival footage and sturdy exposition—and for the sozzled trumpet that rings in the ridiculous era stretching from 1920 to 1933.            The first installment, titled “A Nation of Drunkards,” proves the most compelling, not least because alcohol and its American foes runs in a clear, easily traceable line. An early segment speeds through the back story of American drinking—the booze in the hold of the Mayflower, the daily ration of rum at Valley Forge, John Adams' hard-cider eye-openers. Then we're on to the religious revival of the Second Great Awakening and then evangelists of the Washington Society, a confederacy of reformed drunkards. Early campaigns for personal responsibility gave way to anti-saloon movements and to calls for enforced abstinence. The documentary quotes an anonymous clergyman condemning the last of these: \\"Very little good has ever been done by the absolute shall.\\" A sound insight into human nature. Also, an idea for a liquor brand: Absolut Shall, the vodka for connoisseurs of auxiliary verbs.            Soon, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were addressing the problem of epidemic overindulgence. At a time when any number of men would come home wasted and beat their powerless wives, agitation against horrible potomania was largely a distaff cause, and a running thread of Prohibition tracks the shifting status of women. On the one hand, the Women's Christian Temperance Union and its ilk scapegoated alcohol as the cause of all suffering and the root of all social failures. On the other, they represented an important step in the organization of suffragettes and social reformers. ||||| Summary:","output":"Ken Burns' Prohibition is PBS's three-night documentary that provides a detailed and engaging analysis of the alcohol prohibition era in American history.

Movie title: Goodbye, Mr. Chips Movie plot: In 1920s Britain, Arthur Chipping is an established member of the teaching staff at the Brookfield School. He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Too late for his wife to share in his happiness, Chips was picked as headmaster of Brookfield that same day, and lives out his years at the school, loved by his pupils and comforted by his happy memories.

Here are the options:   * yes  * it is not possible to tell  * no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"The statement \\"I stared at Derry\\" is too broad and offers minimal specific information about what part of Derry was being stared at. It could refer to staring at any part of Derry or even Derry as a whole. Consequently, it can't be conclusively determined from the premise that specific focus was placed on Derry's nose. According to the options provided - yes, it is not possible to tell, and no - the most fitting response to the question, \\"Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?\\" would be \\"it is not possible to tell\\".  This is primarily because the premise does not provide precise details about what the staring was targeted at. The hypothesis is more specific, stating the staring was focused on Derry's nose. However, without such detail in the premise, one cannot ascertain with certainty that the hypothesis follows directly from the premise. In logic and argumentation, the conclusion (in this case, the hypothesis \\"I was staring at Derry's nose\\") must be a logical result of the premise(s). If the premise is too vague or does not contain enough information to fully support the conclusion, then it is not possible to tell whether the conclusion is true based on that premise. And this is the case with the provided premise and hypothesis. The premise simply states that the speaker was staring at Derry, without specifying what part they were staring at. Therefore, it does not convincingly lead to the hypothesis that they were staring at Derry's nose.  It's important to understand that 'impossible to tell' does not necessarily mean 'no'. It merely declares that with the information given, one cannot definitively say 'yes' or 'no'.

Question: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

The given sentence in French, \\"Le présent document n’aborde que la section générale portant sur la planification et la gestion des océans fondée sur les écosystèmes,\\" translates to the above statement in English. The sentence indicates that this particular document is focused specifically on the general topic of planning and managing oceans from an ecosystem-based perspective. This particular approach is essential as it emphasizes the importance of considering the various aspects and interactions among living organisms within the marine ecosystem, alongside their respective environments, thus ensuring a more sustainable and balanced management of ocean resources. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of oceans is crucial for preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy marine ecosystems for the present and future generations. It is a comprehensive and proactive method that not only takes into account the needs of individual species, but also the complex web of interactions between species and their environment. This form of management ultimately leads to more resilient ecosystems, which can better withstand and recover from disturbances such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Ecosystem-based planning and management involves several key elements, including: 1. Identifying and understanding the structure, function, and relationships within an ecosystem – This involves the study and monitoring of species populations, habitats, and environmental factors that influence the marine ecosystem. This knowledge helps to identify critical areas for conservation and potential threats to the ecosystem balance. 2. Establishing clear goals and objectives – Central to any successful ecosystem-based management approach is the establishment of well-defined goals and objectives aimed at the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of marine resources. 3. Integrating social, economic, and ecological considerations – In order for ecosystem-based planning and management to be successful, it must take into account not just the ecological factors, but also the social and economic implications of management decisions. 4. Predictive modeling and scenario analysis – These tools, such as computer simulations and mathematical models, can be used to predict the potential consequences of various management actions and help identify the best strategies to achieve desired objectives and goals. 5. Adaptive management – This approach emphasizes the importance of learning and adapting throughout the management process, recognizing that ecosystems are dynamic and ever-changing and that our understanding of them is continually evolving. 6. Stakeholder involvement – Successful ecosystem-based management must include the participation of various stakeholders, such as local communities, indigenous peoples, industry, scientists, and policymakers. 7. International cooperation – Because marine ecosystems often cross national boundaries, international cooperation is necessary to ensure the effective management of shared resources and the implementation of joint conservation efforts. By emphasizing these key elements, ecosystem-based planning and management of oceans can help contribute to the health and sustainability of our global marine ecosystems. This approach ultimately benefits not only the countless species that rely on healthy oceans for their survival but also the millions of people worldwide who depend on these resources for their livelihoods and well-being."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: \\"Which character insults others?\\"  Context: \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Information:  - The Posavac Hound ( FCI No. 154 ) ( Croatian : posavski goni ) is a breed of dog , originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type . Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound .  - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator.  - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds.  - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3.  - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.  - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets.  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million.  - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.  - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey.  - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group.  - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to:  - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails.  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.  - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.  - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.

How to choose a dog fence for your yard<br>Check local fencing regulations. Your community may have laws about the materials and sizes allowed for residential fences. Don't rely on a fencing company to know the regulations. Can we infer the following? Fencing companies have laws about the type of fences allowed","output":"Choosing the right dog fence for your yard involves several factors and steps. While you mentioned that local fencing regulations should be followed, it is important to note that fencing companies may not always be aware of these regulations. It is essential for homeowners to be well-informed about their community's laws and requirements to ensure compliance. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you select the perfect dog fence for your yard: 1. Check local fencing regulations: As you mentioned, your community may have specific laws regarding the materials, sizes, and styles permitted for residential fences. Contact your local zoning board or homeowners' association to obtain relevant information about these regulations. 2. Determine your objective: Before choosing a dog fence, consider your primary goal, whether it's preventing your dog from escaping, offering safety and security, or enhancing your property's aesthetic appeal. 3. Evaluate your dog's behavior and needs: Different breeds and individual dogs have varying physical abilities and temperaments. Consider your dog's size, energy level, and agility when selecting a fence. For instance, larger dogs may need a taller fence, while those who are prone to digging might require a fence that extends underground. 4. Choose the right fence material: There are several materials available for dog fences, including wood, vinyl, chain-link, metal, and composite. Each material has varying levels of durability, maintenance requirements, and cost. Choose a material based on your budget, maintenance preferences, and the climate of your region. 5. Fence height and visibility: The height of your fence should be adequate to prevent your dog from jumping or climbing over it. Additionally, consider whether you want a fence with an open or closed design. While a closed fence may provide more privacy, an open design, such as a chain-link fence, offers better visibility to monitor your dog's activities from a distance. 6. Include a secure gate: A fence is only as secure as its gate. Ensure that the gate is easy to open and close for you, but difficult for your dog to manipulate. Locks and latches should be durable and secure. 7. Consider incorporating a dog run: If you have a large property or want to provide a dedicated space for your dog to exercise, installing a separate dog run within your fenced yard may be a suitable option. This allows your dog to move around freely without accessing the entire yard. 8. Factor in aesthetics: While the primary purpose of a dog fence is functionality, you should also take into account the fence's appearance and how it will blend with your home's exterior design, landscaping, and overall aesthetic. 9. Obtain multiple quotes: Reach out to several fencing companies or contractors to gather quotes. Discuss your preferences, dog's needs, and local regulations with each company. Make sure you compare the complete costs, including material and installation fees. 10. Seek references and reviews: Once you have narrowed down your selection of fencing companies, research their reputation, previous projects, and customer reviews. This information will give you an idea of the quality and satisfaction you can expect from your chosen provider. In conclusion, while fencing companies may have a general understanding of residential fence regulations, homeowners should always verify their community's specific laws. By considering factors such as local regulations, your dog's needs, fence materials, design, and aesthetics, you will be able to select the perfect dog fence for your yard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft.   - A flight simulator is a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies, for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities.  - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS.  - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his \\"Riftwar\\" novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Article: Cops are programmed to pay attention to every detail, and this also applies to their love interests. To keep the attention of a police officer, avoid committing civilian and traffic crimes, such as speeding, running a red light, or shoplifting. If you have a lengthy record full of traffic violations or crime, you likely will not attract a cop. If you are unsure of what is on your record, search online to find free background checks. You can easily run your information and see what information your cop crush can find. If you want to attract an officer, demonstrate your love for fitness and health. You should work out at least 3 times a week for about 30 - 90 minutes, if you can. Limit your consumption of sugar, processed foods, and junk food. Eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables on average, and drink 8 glasses of water each day. Police officers must complete particular fitness evaluations to earn their positions, and they must be in good shape to act as a cop. To charm an officer, ask them questions about why they became a police officer and what they like and dislike about their work. Showing genuine interest in their stressful, unconventional career will likely help the officer trust you and further your connection.  For example, say something like, \\"So Jack, why did you want to be a cop?\\" When you chat, keep consistent eye contact and smile at them so they know you are engaged in the conversation. It is common for the stress of an officer's duty to follow them home. In these instances, the best way to get the officer to like you is to show them your support. When the officer mentions reasons they are distressed, listen to all the details they give you, and respond with compassionate comments.  For example, say something like, “I'm so sorry you had to deal with that today. I am proud you were there to help. Can I get you anything?” This shows them you are appreciative of their sacrifices and there to help take away their burden. There are some instances where the officer will not be able to give you much details, so they don't break any confidentiality agreements. Respect this and be patient with the details they do offer. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To attract a police officer, avoid committing crimes or traffic violations, maintain good physical fitness, and show genuine interest in their career by asking questions about their experiences.

Article: At 2 p.m. on December 5, 1945, five Navy aircraft took off in perfect flying weather from a naval air installation in southeastern Florida, on a routine training mission over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the flight commander radioed that he was \\"completely lost\\". Then there was silence. A rescue plane was sent to search for the missing aircraft, and it, too, disappeared. Despite one of history's most extensive search efforts, involving more than 300 planes and dozens of ships, the Navy found nothing, not even an oil stain floating on the water. This is just one of the many frightening stories told of \\"the Bermuda Triangle\\", a mysterious area of the Atlantic Ocean roughly stretching southwest from Bermuda to the Florida coast and down to Puerto Rico. During the past 30 years, the triangle has claimed the lives of some 1,000 sailors and pilots. Stranger yet are the numerous \\"ghost\\" ships that have been found floating crewless within the triangle. On one strange occasion in 1881, the cargo shipEllen Austindiscovered a small sailing ship, sails waving uselessly in the wind. The boat was full of wood with no one on deck. The captain of theEllen Austininstalled a new crew to sail it, but two days later, during a rough storm, the two ships temporarily lost sight of each other. When the captain again boarded the boat, he found his crew had disappeared. After a second crew was assigned, the ship was again lost in a fog bank. This time, no trace of the boat -- or the crew -- was ever found. Charles Berlitz, a man with an interest in Atlantis, the legendary lost island, puts forward his theory that a giant solar crystal, which once was the power generator for Atlantis, lies on the ocean floor. From time to time, according to his theory, passing ships and planes set off the crystal, which confuses their instruments and _ them into the ocean.

Based on the information provided, the Alps had a larger area covered by glaciers in 1876, with 1,817 square kilometres compared to 1,342 square kilometres in 1973. As glaciers contribute to river run-off when they melt, it can be inferred that there was more river run-off from the Alps in the year 1876 compared to 1973.
