Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism.  - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization.

Many people think that once you get infected by colds, you will not be easy to be attacked by colds for the rest of your life. That's not the case. There are about 200 different viruses that cause the common cold. You catch a cold because of one kind of them this time, but you might catch a cold next time because of another. Others believe that people get sick just because of the cold weather in winter. That is also wrong. It's because people tend to stay closer in winter and the cold virus is _ from one person to another through handshakes, sneezing, or coughing. While there is no actual cure for the common cold, scientists say there are still a few things you can do to help you. Some experts say honey and chicken soup are effective against colds.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian opposition activists called mass protests for Friday to test a fragile, day-old ceasefire by President Bashar al-Assad's forces, and international pressure mounted for Damascus to fully comply with a U.N.-backed peace plan.      Anxious to build on a truce between the armed forces and rebels which brought an eerie calm to Syria on Thursday, after more than a year of clashes, the U.N. Security Council worked on a resolution authorizing U.N. observers to monitor it.      World leaders welcomed the halt in fighting which had threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the situation looked calmer.      \\"The world is watching, however, with skeptical eyes since many promises previously made by the government of Syria have not been kept,\\" he told a news conference in Geneva.      Along with the withdrawal of forces from population centers, U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's six-point plan calls for talks with the opposition aimed at a \\"political transition\\", the release of political prisoners, access for humanitarian aid and journalists, and for the authorities to \\"respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully\\".      Burhan Ghalioun, head of the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC), said he did not trust the authorities to allow the renewal of protests after Friday prayers, a feature of the uprising that has been subdued by violence in recent months.      The authorities, he said, had their \\"hand on the trigger\\".      \\"While we call on the Syrian people to protest strongly... we ask them to be cautious because the regime will not respect the ceasefire and will shoot,\\" he told Reuters.      AUTHORISED PROTESTS      The Syrian Interior Ministry said only pre-authorized demonstrations would be permitted by police, a caveat which the opposition said did not bode well.      \\"This is ridiculous,\\" said an activist called Musab from Hama city, a focus of opposition activity and government bombardment along with Homs and Idlib. \\"They will not give you permission and you will be taken to jail if you ask for it\\".      He said a demonstration on Wednesday in the town of Qalat Madiq, in Hama province, had been broken up by security forces firing, and nine people were arrested. Most independent media are banned from Syria, making such reports impossible to verify.      In Homs, where opposition stronghold districts were all but deserted, activist Yazan expressed doubt people would dare to go out because snipers, tanks and soldiers were still in place. \\"People are wary and they believe that this ceasefire is only temporary. Nobody is leaving their homes,\\" he said.      The SNC's spokesman said Assad could simply not afford to stop shooting, since that would allow a new wave of mass protests against his family's four decades of absolute power.      \\"As soon as there is a real ceasefire, people will come out to the streets, demonstrating and demanding his removal, his stepping down. So I think the regime has to retaliate by opening fire again,\\" spokesman Bassam Imadi told Reuters in Istanbul. \\"But let's hope for the better.\\"      OBERVER DEPLOYMENT      Annan, mandated by the United Nations and Arab League, has called for 200 to 250 unarmed U.N. observers to monitor the ceasefire.      A similar Arab League mission ended in disarray amid mounting violence in January, but Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the 15-member Security Council could adopt a resolution authorizing the deployment of a U.N. observer force as early as Friday.      \\"The full-fledged mission will take some time to deploy ... If we are able to put 20 or 30 monitors (there) early next week, very good,\\" Churkin said. \\"If we are able to put more in the next few days that's even better.\\"      A draft resolution drawn up by the United States would have the Council authorize an initial deployment of up to 30 observers and demand the withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from population centers and an end to violence on all sides.      It included a vague threat of future action against Damascus, saying the council \\"expresses its determination, in the event that the Syrian government does not implement its commitments, to consider further measures as appropriate\\".      It was not immediately clear how Russia and China, which vetoed two previous resolutions condemning Assad's 13-month assault on anti-government protesters, reacted to the draft, which diplomats discussed behind closed doors on Thursday.      Most of the demands in it were addressed to the Syrian government, which could irritate Moscow and Beijing. Both have welcomed the ceasefire while emphasizing the requirement for rebel forces to comply.      The United States and European Union have imposed their own sanctions against Damascus after failing to persuade Russia and China to join in.      Moscow and Beijing are wary of further U.N. moves, alarmed by the way last year's Security Council resolution on Libya led to military intervention, though Western leaders are also cautious about intervening in Syria's mix of religious and ethnic groups.      Ban said there had been a surge in Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkey and Lebanon this week and an estimated 1 million people inside Syria now needed humanitarian assistance.      He was urging Assad to keep his promise and to exercise maximum restraint, he said.      \\"This ceasefire process is very fragile - it may be broken any time if, and when, there is another gunshot,\\" Ban said. \\"This is a very worrisome.\\"      (Additional reporting by Louis Charbonneau and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles in Geneva, Oliver Holmes and Douglas Hamilton in Beirut, Michael Holden in London and Balazs Koranyi in Oslo; writing by Philippa Fletcher; editing by Jon Boyle) ||||| Activist groups said at least five people were killed when Syrian troops opened fire on demonstrators and on civilians returning to their homes, and President Bashar al-Assad's government accused “terrorists” of carrying out two bombings and an assassination in which at least two people died.      It was clear, however, that Syria was quieter than it has been for months, leading to cautious hope that the six-point peace plan proposed by the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan may help end the bloodshed and usher in a negotiated settlement to the country’s 13-month-old uprising.      “Syria is apparently experiencing a rare moment of calm on the ground,” Annan said in a statement from Geneva. “This must now be sustained.”      In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton cautioned that the cease-fire could be considered only “a fragile first step.”      “Sporadic fighting continues in parts of Syria,” she told reporters at a Group of Eight meeting. Assad's forces “have not pulled back, and he has not taken any action on any of the other points.”      The United States is now pushing for a speedy resolution at the United Nations that would oblige Assad to comply with all the requirements of the six-point plan, including the withdrawal of troops from cities, access for humanitarian aid and journalists, and permitting peaceful protests, she said.      “The Annan plan is not a menu of options,” Clinton said. “They cannot pick and choose.”      The United States circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations that would establish an advance team of up to 30 U.N. monitors to observe the cease-fire. The council is expected to follow up in the coming weeks with a second resolution that would establish a full-fledged monitoring mission with as many as 250 monitors, most of them recruited from other U.N. missions in the region.      There was broad consensus in the 15-nation Security Council about the need to support Annan’s request for U.N. monitors, and Russia’s U.N. envoy, Vitaly Churkin, said it was possible the council could approve the mission by Friday.      Whether the lull in violence signaled any more than a pause was in question. The sustained shelling of residential areas loyal to the opposition that had killed hundreds of people in recent weeks came to a halt, but there was no indication that the government had pulled its forces out of the cities.      Such a move could trigger a revival of the mass demonstrations that shook the country in the early months of the uprising, and the government appeared intent on preventing the opposition from taking advantage of the cease-fire to call people onto the streets. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Syrian opposition activists called for mass protests to test the fragile ceasefire by President Bashar al-Assad's forces while international pressure mounted for Damascus to comply with the U.N.-backed peace plan.

Archaeologists have uncovered treasure buried by the desperate citizens of a town under siege by the Roman army some 2,000 years ago. Hundreds of bronze coins, and various items of gold, silver and bronze jewellery were found beneath an ancient fortress in the Crimean settlement of Artezia, in modern day Ukraine. Researchers believe the loot was hurriedly buried by wealthy people sheltering from the attacking Roman legions who were backing one side in a civil war. Buried for 2,000 years: Archaeologists have uncovered hoards of buried treasure hidden beneath a Black Sea fortress by residents who were facing the might of Rome's legions during a destructive civil war. 'The fortress had been besieged. Wealthy people from the settlement and the neighborhood had tried to hide there from the Romans,' said Nikolaï Vinokurov, a professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University. 'They had buried their hoards inside the citadel.' As the Romans highly trained and well equipped soldiers attacked people huddled in the citadel for protection, however Professor Vinokoruv told LiveScience they knew they would not survive. At the time of the siege and fall of the fortress in 45AD, Artezian was a part of the Bosporous Kingdom where a rivalry was playing out between two brothers for political control. The elder, Mithridates VIII, wanted to win independence from the Roman Empire, while his younger brother Cotys wanted to keep the kingdom as a client state. Roman soldiers soon arrived to support Cotys' claims to the throne. They established his regime in the Bosporan capital and torched settlements controlled by his brother, including Artezian. Hellenistic culture: These two rings are engraved with the images of Greek gods. The people of the region borrowed many aspects of their culture from Greek colonists who had established outposts in the are hundreds of years before. A silver brooch depicts Aphrodite, goddess of love: Centuries earlier, at the height of classical Greek culture, sailors had navigated the Black Sea and created colonies to the east, intermarrying with the locals. Professor Vinokurov's team have been recruiting volunteers to study the town since 1989. It covered an area of at least 3.2 acrea, including a necropolis where many finds have been made. Archaeologists' work in the area has revealed that the people of Artezian followed a culture that was distinctly Hellenistic. Professor Vinokurov said that although the ethnicity of Artezian's residents was mixed, 'their culture was pure Greek. They spoke Greek language, had Greek school; the architecture and fortification were Greek as well. 'They were Hellenes by culture but not that pure by blood.' Write caption here. Ancient decorated spindles were also found on site: The Romans arrived in support of Cotys I, a usurper to the throne of the Kingdom of Bosporous, who asked for their help with deposing his older brother. Centuries earlier, at the height of classical Greek culture, sailors had navigated the Black Sea and created colonies to the east, intermarrying with the locals. Their customs and crafts seem to have endured through the intervening years despite being practised nearly 600 miles from Greece itself. This influence can be seen in the treasures the people of Artezia concealed as they waited for the final assault from their Roman enemies. Among the finds is a silver brooch engraved with an image of Aphrodite, Greek goddess of love, as well as gold rings set with gems on which are engraved images of Nemesis and Tyche, both also Greek deities. Dig: Nikolaï Vinokurov, a professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University, has been leading expeditions to the Artezian site for archaeologists and volunteers since 1987. Peeling back the past: The fortress at Artezian was torched by the Romans in 45AD, then later rebuilt - but it's treasure remained undiscovered until now. Excavations of other portions of the site, which was razed to the ground by the attacking army, have revealed further evidence that the people of Artezia had a Greek culture. 'In the burnt level of the early citadel, many fragmentary small terra cotta figures were found depicting Demeter, Cora, Cybele, Aphrodite with a dolphin, Psyche and Eros, a maiden with gifts, Hermes, Attis, foot soldiers and warriors on horseback, semi-naked youths,' the researchers wrote in their paper, published this month in the journal Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia. The town was later rebuilt by Cotys I, who successfully managed to dispatch his brother with Roman help, but the treasures of its earlier inhabitants have remained untouched until now.

The man packed his things in a box instead of a bag because the","output":"box offered more stability and protection for his belongings. It was an unusual choice, but he had always been one to think outside the box – or, in this case, inside it. He carefully arranged his clothes and essentials, making sure that everything fit snugly and securely. Upon finishing, he secured the box with sturdy tape and attached a label with his name and address. He was leaving town that afternoon, and he couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. The decision to venture into the unknown and start anew in a different city had been a difficult one to make. In recent months, life in his small hometown had become increasingly unbearable due to a bitter feud between his family and another prominent local family. It seemed as though there was no end to the animosity, and the constant tension was beginning to take its toll on him. He knew that he needed to free himself from the toxic environment and find his own path. The man had decided to move to a distant city known for its vibrant arts scene, where he could pursue his dream of becoming a painter. He had been researching the city and its numerous art galleries, studios, and creative collectives, and was eager to immerse himself in a community that valued self-expression and artistic freedom. As he lugged the box containing his belongings to the train station, he glanced over his shoulder one last time, taking in the familiar sights of the only home he had ever known. A pang of nostalgia struck him momentarily, but he quickly steeled himself, knowing that he had no choice but to move forward. Upon boarding the train, he settled into his seat and gazed out the window, watching as the landscape gradually changed from the lush green fields of his hometown to the sprawling urban jungle of his new city. It was during that journey that he began imagining the kind of life he would build in this new environment. Though the uncertainty was daunting, it was accompanied by an undeniable sense of opportunity and freedom. Arriving in the city, he stepped off the train and found himself amidst a sea of unfamiliar faces. With the weight of the box on his shoulders, he navigated the bustling streets and towering skyscrapers in search of his new home – a small apartment in an old, bohemian neighborhood. After settling into his new place and unpacking his box, he set out to explore his surroundings. He stumbled upon lively cafes, galleries filled with awe-inspiring artwork, and parks teeming with artists and musicians. As the days turned to weeks, he began to form a network of friends and mentors who encouraged him to push past his limits and refine his artistic skills. Through perseverance, talent, and an unwavering commitment to his craft, the man gradually established a reputation in the local art scene. He began showcasing his work in galleries and participating in collaborative exhibitions with other artists. Over time, his unique artistic style garnered significant attention within the community and beyond, resulting in a steady stream of patrons and collectors eager to acquire his paintings. As he carved out his niche, he found that the city, once alien and imposing, had slowly become his sanctuary, a place where he could truly be himself and where his artistry flourished. In the years that followed, the man never forgot the circumstances that had led him to pack his belongings in a box and leave his hometown in search of a new beginning. By forging his own path, he had not only escaped a bitter feud but had found a sense of purpose and belonging that transcended the constraints of his past. The tale of the man who chose to pack his life in a box instead of a bag acts as a powerful reminder to us all. It teaches us that sometimes, stepping away from the familiar and embracing the unknown can open doors to incredible opportunities and transformative life experiences.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Vol. 1 : Unreleased ( aka The Official Jay Dee Instrumental Series Vol.1 : Unreleased ) is an instrumental album by the late Detroit record producer , Jay Dee , released in 2002 .

The league secured broadcasting deals with other major networks, such as NBC and CBS, giving fans across the nation greater opportunities to watch live games and follow their favorite teams.

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Cnidaria. Yes or no? Answer: Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians, although considered more \\"primitive\\" than bilaterians, have a wider range of genes. Question: what is phylum cnidaria Answer:","output":"Phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic invertebrate animals that includes organisms such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras. Cnidarians are predominantly marine species, but some can also be found in freshwater environments. They are characterized by their radial symmetry, which means their body parts are arranged symmetrically around a central axis.  The notable feature that unifies the members of this phylum is the presence of cnidocytes, specialized cells that contain structures called nematocysts. Nematocysts are essentially stinging organelles that help cnidarians capture prey and defend against predators.  Cnidarians exhibit two main body forms known as the polyp and the medusa. Polyps are sessile or attached to a substrate, with their mouth surrounded by tentacles facing upward. Medusae are free-swimming forms with their mouth and tentacles oriented downward. Some cnidarians, like the jellyfish, have a complex life cycle that involves both polyp and medusa stages, while others, such as sea anemones, exist only as polyps. In terms of genetic diversity, recent analyses suggest that despite being considered more primitive than bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry, like humans), cnidarians possess a broader range of genes. This implies that they might have undergone more extensive genome evolution than previously thought, and some of their genetic complexity could have been inherited by their descendants, the bilaterians. In summary, phylum Cnidaria is a group of invertebrates that includes animals like jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras. They are predominantly aquatic and characterized by their radial symmetry and unique cells containing nematocysts. Remarkably, cnidarians have a wider range of genes than previously believed, even though they are considered more primitive than bilaterians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After leaving the Washoe County Courthouse, Roslyn ignores Raymond's attempts to talk to her, and meets with her best local friend and landlord, Isabelle Steers, who is also a divorcee. Isabelle takes Roslyn to a bar at Harrah's Reno for drinks to let the reality of her divorce sink in. While there, they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord 'Gay' Langland and his tow truck driver friend Guido. They invite Roslyn and Isabelle to Guido's old house in the Nevada country to help her forget about the divorce, after Gay tells Roslyn that he is also divorced. They arrive at the unfinished house Guido built for his late wife, who died several years earlier during childbirth. They drink and dance.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens? ?  York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens is Etty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast, and produced on a top budget, with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck, the movie fails dismally on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters.

Place spacers in the gap. Guidelines can be placed by finding the center point of each wall and marking a line between them, creating a cross at the center of the room. Where one of these lines meets with the wall, mark the manufacturer’s recommended expansion distance and then draw a line at that point which is perpendicular to the center line. Use the drill to make guide holes and then, using a hammer, nail the board into the subfloor with nails placed 1-3” from the end of the plank, ½” from the groove side, and every six inches down the board. Use a nail set to finish. When the first row is done, place the next board so that the tongue of the first fits into the groove. You will want to place the boards so that they are offset, beginning six inches or so from the ending of the previous board. Use a mallet and tapping block to tap the boards together and create a tight seam. You will nail the first three rows just as described in Step 2. Since you are staggering boards, you will likely need to cut boards in order to fit in the gaps at the end. Measure the distance that it needs to be, keeping the expansion gap in mind, and then (with the board face-down) cut it using a saw. Once you have enough space, you should begin using the flooring nailer (though you could technically do the entire floor with the hammer and nails). Simply align it with the board to be nailed and then hit it. You will eventually run out of room to use the flooring nailer. Hammer the last few rows the same way you did the first ones. If it does not fit properly, you will need to cut the final board so that it is narrow enough to fit. Measure carefully and use a circular or miter saw to cut the boards to size. Since you will not have enough space to tap them with the mallet, use a crowbar instead to wedge them into place. You are now ready to finish your floor. What is a summary?","output":"A summary would be: To install a floor, first leave a small gap at the wall for expansion and measure the room to find the center point. Use spacers and guidelines to place the first boards, and then hammer them into the subfloor. Continue adding rows of boards, offsetting them and cutting them to fit as needed. Use a flooring nailer for faster installation in the middle sections, but use a hammer and nails for the first and last few rows. Finally, cut and fit the last board carefully, using a crowbar to wedge it into place. Once done, you have a finished floor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.  Question: \\"What motivated Secret Service to enhance White House security?\\" Response: \\"FAA orders\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choose your answer from: A). no B). yes","output":"A). no This is because the text states that the Secret Service enhanced White House security as a reaction to the second plane hitting the World Trade Center, not because of any orders from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

A simulated school shooting in Massachusetts   showed what 'active shooter' technology could do to help police catch a gunman if the horrific threat ever strikes. In the live demonstration, the 'gunman' entered the school armed with an assault rifle, opening fire with dummy rounds first in the school library and then rampaging through hallways and classrooms. But he had only a few minutes to wreak havoc. Smoke alarm-sized sensors installed in classrooms, hallways and other points throughout the building were activated by the sounds of gunfire, and police officers were immediately able to track his movements and quickly subdue him. Scroll down for video. Officers carry training weapons as they search the halls of the Methuen school during the live demonstration. Nearly 100 people gathered in the school auditorium to observe the demonstration of what the school district bills as the first such system operating in a public school in the U.S. Students were off for the Veterans Day holiday, so the Methuen grammar school was empty for the demonstration to take place. Police Chief Joseph Solomon said he believes such systems should be required in many public buildings, just as fire suppression systems and smoke detectors are. 'It's amazing, the short, split-second amount of time from identification of the shot to transmission of the message,' he said following the demonstration. 'It changes the whole game. Without that shot detection system, we wouldn't know what was going on in the school ... Valuable, valuable time can be lost. Unfortunately, with school crisis situations, it's about mitigating loss.' Police respond to the 'gunman' who entered the school with an assault rifle, opening fire with dummy round. Lieutenant Greg Gallant, of the Methuen police department, portrays an active shooter as he roams the halls of a school with an assault rifle, loaded with dummy rounds, during the demonstration. The system works using smoke alarm-sized sensors that are installed in classrooms, hallways and other points throughout the building and are activated by the sounds of gunfire. School Superintendent Judith Scannell said she hopes the district of about 7,300 students can find the money to pay for outfitting its four other schools. The new system was installed at no cost by Shooter Detection Systems, a Massachusetts-based company. CEO Christian Connors said it is installing the technology in two more schools in Virginia and California, as well as undisclosed airports. Founded in 2013, the company is among others across the country trying to market such 'active shooter' systems to the owners and operators of malls, airports, government offices, schools and other public buildings. Smoke alarm-sized sensors installed in classrooms, hallways and other points throughout the building were activated by the sounds of gunfire. Later this month, Savannah College Art and Design in Georgia is expected to become the first college in the country to launch such technology, using a system developed by California-based company SST. Mr Connors said his company's technology is based on systems successfully developed for the military to help soldiers locate enemy fire during battles and could cost anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000, depending on the size and structure of the building. Methuen has never been targeted, but three schools briefly were placed on lockdown last month after a psychiatric patient at nearby Holy Family Hospital reported a man with a gun in the clinic. Methuen long has been among the more active districts in the state in addressing school safety. Officers were immediately able to track the movements of the 'gunman' (pictured) and quickly subdue him. Graph shows how school shootings and fatalities in the United States have increased. Situated about 30 miles north of Boston, the district was one of the first to post uniformed police, known as school resource officers, in its schools. Methuen was also among the first to conduct 'active threat' drills for police officers following a rash of school shootings across the country, including the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 children and school staff. Suzanne Kennan, a resident who lives across from the school, said she had not been aware the district made the upgrade, but she said she supported the investment. 'Unfortunately we're at a point where we have to do something like this,' she said. 'Instead of burying our heads in the sand and thinking this will never happen, they're doing something. You never know where this is going to happen next. Why take that chance?' The new system was installed at no cost by Shooter Detection Systems, a Massachusetts-based company.

If Operating information is also needed to determine whether the agency is achieving its compliance requirements under various laws and regulations., can we conclude that \\"Operating information in essential in determining whether or not the agency is compliant with legal requirements. \\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that operating information is essential in determining whether or not the agency is compliant with legal requirements. Operating information refers to the data and details related to the day-to-day functioning, processes, procedures, and performance of an organization or agency. This information enables leaders and decision-makers to effectively evaluate and manage the operations of their organization, ensuring that it remains aligned with its goals and objectives. In the context of legal compliance, various laws and regulations govern the operations of agencies, such as environmental protection laws, labor laws, and safety regulations. These laws and regulations are put in place to ensure that organizations conduct their operations ethically, safely, transparently, and responsibly. In order to assess the agency's compliance with these legal requirements, pertinent operating information must be gathered, analyzed, and scrutinized. There are several ways in which operating information can help determine legal compliance: 1. Monitoring performance: By collecting and analyzing operating information, agencies can identify trends, patterns, and progress in their operations. This enables them to ensure they are meeting their legal obligations by identifying any areas of non-compliance and taking proactive measures to address them before they become severe. 2. Reporting requirements: Many laws and regulations mandate agencies to submit regular reports to governing bodies or regulatory agencies, outlining their operations, procedures, and performance data. Operating information provides the raw data needed to create these reports, demonstrating the organization's compliance with numerous legal requirements. 3. Employee training and awareness: Regular collection and dissemination of operating information can help raise awareness among employees about the importance of legal compliance. By engaging workers in the process of monitoring and maintaining compliance, organizations foster a culture of shared responsibility that reduces the chances of non-compliant behavior. 4. Audits and inspections: External audits and inspections, conducted by regulatory agencies or independent evaluators, often rely on operating information as evidence of an organization's compliance with laws and regulations. By utilizing accurate and up-to-date data, organizations can demonstrate their ongoing efforts to adhere to applicable legal requirements. 5. Risk assessment and mitigation: Operating information can also be utilized to assess and identify potential risks or vulnerabilities within an organization that could potentially lead to non-compliance. With this knowledge, agencies can proactively implement controls or mitigation strategies to minimize the chances of legal non-compliance. In conclusion, operating information is indeed essential in determining whether or not an agency is compliant with legal requirements. This data allows organizations to monitor their performance, submit required reports, engage employees in compliance efforts, prepare for audits, and assess potential risks. By maintaining accurate and up-to-date operating information, agencies can ensure that they are meeting their legal obligations and operating in an ethical, responsible, and transparent manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet seems to convey a mixture of sensations and emotions, primarily revolving around the experiences of physical discomfort and the underlying satisfaction or contentment derived from the reasons behind the discomfort. Firstly, the mention of \\"ears are ringing\\" suggests that the individual has recently been exposed to a loud environment, possibly a concert, party, or an extremely noisy setting. This exposure often leads to temporary tinnitus, a condition characterized by a ringing or buzzing sound in the ears. Additionally, the mention of \\"aching puppies\\" most likely refers to the person's feet being sore or in pain, possibly due to extended periods of walking, dancing, or engaging in some strenuous activity where their feet were in use for a long time. Despite expressing the physical discomfort they are experiencing, the individual still describes these feelings as \\"totally worth it.\\" This suggests that the event or activity they participated in was so enjoyable, memorable, or important to them that they are willing to accept the discomfort in exchange for the positive experiences they had. For example, they might have attended an exceptionally enjoyable concert where they danced or sang along with their favorite artist. Or they could have participated in an event that held some personal significance, such as a charity walk or a marathon. In conclusion, the sentiment embodied by this tweet highlights the idea that some experiences are of such value that individuals are willing to pay the price of temporary physical discomfort. The tweet emphasizes the importance of cherishing and celebrating those moments that bring people happiness or a sense of achievement, even if they result in knees hurting or ringing ears.

Sugarland is an American country music duo consisting of singer-songwriters Jennifer Nettles (lead vocals) and Kristian Bush (vocals, acoustic guitar, mandolin). Sugarland was founded in 2002 by Kristen Hall with Bush and became a trio after hiring Jennifer Nettles. Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2004, Sugarland broke through that year with the release of their debut single \\"Baby Girl\\", the first single from their multi-platinum debut album Twice the Speed of Life. Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles paired with Pepsi Max and recorded a commercial for Super Bowl XLVI. Nettles recorded Hank Williams' \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\" which is featured in the commercial as a Coke Zero delivery man tries to buy a Pepsi Max without being discovered.  Sugarland recorded a song for the 2012 movie, Act of Valor. The soundtrack to the movie was released on February 21, 2012. The song is titled \\"Guide You Home\\". Kristian Bush confirmed in late January that Sugarland will be touring in \\"mid to late Spring\\" and that they're \\"going to source our fans for our set list.\\" On April 5, 2012, the duo commenced their fourth headlining tour: In Your Hands tour 2012. On June 18, it was announced that Nettles was pregnant and due in November, two months after their summer tour concluded. Her son, Magnus Hamilton Miller, was born on December 6, 2012.  With Nettles on maternity leave, Bush made his solo debut in March 2013 at the inaugural C2C: Country to Country Festival at the O2 Arena in London, England; his first song release as a solo act, \\"Love or Money,\\" debuted on iTunes in Europe the following week. He often takes part in the Country Music Association's Songwriters Series, which has included various appearances across the United States, as well as time spent abroad with the CMA's first-ever international initiative showcasing Nashville songwriters and their work to foreign audiences in clubs and theaters.  In August 2013, Nettles released a solo single, \\"That Girl\\", for Mercury. It is the lead single to her solo album of the same name, released on January 14, 2014 via Mercury Nashville. Rick Rubin produced the album. Her second album Playing with Fire was released in 2016 and, like Bush did in 2013, Nettles played the 2017 C2C: Country to Country Festival.  In 2014, Bush signed to producer Byron Gallimore's Streamsound Records as a solo artist. His debut solo single, \\"Trailer Hitch,\\" was released to radio and retailers on July 28, 2014. His debut solo album, Southern Gravity, was released on April 7, 2015. He wrote 300 songs for the project, which he refers to as a \\"mainstream country record that is meant to be played on the radio.\\" Nettles released two solo albums in 2016, Playing with Fire on May 13, and To Celebrate Christmas on October 28.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and \\"C\\" is denoted formula_1.  - In geometry, a hexagon (from Greek  \\"hex\\", \\"six\\" and , \\"gonía\\", \\"corner, angle\\") is a six sided polygon or 6-gon. The total of the internal angles of any hexagon is 720°.  - In geometry , the trihexagonal tiling is one of 11 uniform tilings of the Euclidean plane by regular polygons . It consists of equilateral triangles and regular hexagons , arranged so that each hexagon is surrounded by triangles and vice versa . The name derives from the fact that it combines a regular hexagonal tiling and a regular triangular tiling . Two hexagons and two triangles alternate around each vertex , and its edges form an infinite arrangement of lines . Its dual is the rhombille tiling . This pattern , and its place in the classification of uniform tilings , was already known to Johannes Kepler in his 1619 book Harmonices Mundi . The pattern has long been used in Japanese basketry , where it is called kagome . The Japanese term for this pattern has been taken up in physics , where it is called a Kagome lattice . It occurs also in the crystal structures of certain minerals . Conway calls it a hexadeltille , combining alternate elements from a hexagonal tiling ( hextille ) and triangular tiling ( deltille ) .  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - A tessellation of a flat surface is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of geometries.  - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.  - In geometry an arrangement of lines is the partition of the plane formed by a collection of lines. Bounds on the complexity of arrangements have been studied in discrete geometry, and computational geometers have found algorithms for the efficient construction of arrangements.  - In geometry, the rhombille tiling, also known as tumbling blocks, reversible cubes, or the dice lattice, is a tessellation of identical 60° rhombi on the Euclidean plane. Each rhombus has two 60° and two 120° angles; rhombi with this shape are sometimes also called diamonds. Sets of three rhombi meet at their 120° angles and sets of six rhombi meet at their 60° angles.  - In geometry, the triangular tiling or triangular tessellation is one of the three regular tilings of the Euclidean plane. Because the internal angle of the equilateral triangle is 60 degrees, six triangles at a point occupy a full 360 degrees. The triangular tiling has Schläfli symbol of {3,6}.  - In planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the \\"sides\\" of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the \\"vertex\\" of the angle. Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces. These are called dihedral angles. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the spherical angle formed by two great circles on a sphere is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.  - Geometry (from the ; \\"geo-\\" \\"earth\\", \\"-metron\\" \\"measurement\\") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.  - In geometry, the Schläfli symbol is a notation of the form {p,q,r...} that defines regular polytopes and tessellations.  - In geometry, the hexagonal tiling or hexagonal tessellation is a regular tiling of the Euclidean plane, in which three hexagons meet at each vertex. It has Schläfli symbol of {6,3} or \\"t\\"{3,6} (as a truncated triangular tiling).  - Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are branches of geometry that study combinatorial properties and constructive methods of discrete geometric objects. Most questions in discrete geometry involve finite or discrete sets of basic geometric objects, such as points, lines, planes, circles, spheres, polygons, and so forth. The subject focuses on the combinatorial properties of these objects, such as how they intersect one another, or how they may be arranged to cover a larger object.

Write an article based on this summary: The costs of tackling climate change can be slashed if a network of pipes is built to store waste carbon dioxide under the North Sea, a report says.","output":"Title: Tackling Climate Change: The Potential of an Undersea Carbon Storage Network Introduction Climate change is an enormous global challenge that needs urgent intervention. It demands the strategic management of our current resources, the use of advanced technologies, and international cooperation to slow down the rate of alarming temperature increase. One such approach to tackle this issue is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), whereby carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored to prevent further damage to the atmosphere. A recently published report suggests that building a network of pipes to store waste carbon dioxide under the North Sea can dramatically reduce the costs of managing climate change. In this article, we will explore the potential of this idea and how it can revolutionize the fight against climate change. The Concept of Carbon Capture and Storage Carbon Capture and Storage is a three-step process: first, the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated from industrial processes and power plants is captured before it is released into the atmosphere. Next, the captured CO2 is transported, typically through pipelines or ships, to a storage location. Finally, the CO2 is injected and stored deep underground in geological structures, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, and other porous rock formations. The North Sea: An Ideal Storage Location The North Sea presents an ideal location for storing waste carbon dioxide due to the presence of vast, depleted oil and gas reservoirs beneath its seabed. These reservoirs have a proven capacity to hold large volumes of CO2 securely for millions of years. Additionally, the existing infrastructure for oil and gas extraction, along with well-established pipelines and systems, can be adapted and utilized for transporting captured CO2. This provides a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for building new storage facilities on land and ensuring a robust, safe, and long-term storage strategy. Reducing the Costs of Tackling Climate Change While the implementation of CCS has been faced with high initial costs, building a network of pipes under the North Sea brings forth numerous advantages that can slash climate change management costs significantly. Here are some principal ways in which the undersea network will benefit the overall CCS process: 1. Economies of Scale: By aggregating captured CO2 from multiple industrial plants and power stations, the proposed network of pipes would allow for increased cost-effectiveness. Centralized storage and infrastructure sharing would lower individual plant costs, making it more appealing for industries to adopt CCS technology. 2. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure: As mentioned earlier, the North Sea offers suitable storage sites and the opportunity to repurpose and augment existing oil and gas transport infrastructure, which would result in lower development costs. 3. Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing monitoring of CO2 stored in depleted reservoirs is essential to ensure safety and prevent leaks. An interconnected undersea network would provide a single, consolidated system for such monitoring, which would reduce the cost and complexity of managing multiple storage sites. 4. International Collaboration: A shared undersea storage network presents an excellent opportunity for collaboration among European countries that border the North Sea. This joint effort would further reduce the costs and accelerate the deployment of CCS technology across the region. The Road Ahead The undersea carbon storage network holds the promise of revolutionizing climate change mitigation strategies. It provides a unique and cost-effective pathway to reduce waste CO2 emissions and protect our planet. However, the success of this project requires comprehensive planning, collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, environmental organizations, and robust financial investments. With the right efforts in place, the North Sea could become not just a symbol for the region's oil and gas legacy but also a global model for the collaborative fight against climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As we sat together on the park bench, the man opened up about his struggles, explaining how he had been recently diagnosed with a serious medical condition that had turned his life upside down. He spoke of the fears he had for the future, the uncertainty of how his health would progress, and his anxiety about the potential impact on his family and loved ones. He also shared his feelings of sadness and moments of despair, as he often felt isolated and overwhelmed by the weight of his diagnosis. As I listened to him, I could sense his genuine need to speak with someone who would understand, empathize, and show compassion. At the same time, I realized that being present and offering a listening ear allowed me to understand his unique experience better, helping me to engage meaningfully with him while respecting his feelings and sentiments. I acknowledged his pain and challenges but also encouraged him to focus on the positive aspects of his life, like the support and love of his family and friends, and the advances in medical research that could potentially improve his quality of life over time.

Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

To understand why, let's examine the roles of the different words in the sentence, as well as the sentence structure and word collocations. First, we can identify the subject of the sentence as \\"Mary.\\" She is the one who performed an action, which is \\"tried\\" in this case. \\"Tried\\" functions as the verb in the sentence, but it appears to be used incorrectly here. In English, the verb \\"try\\" collocates with an infinitive verb preceded by \\"to\\" to express an attempt to do something: \\"try to do,\\" \\"try to eat,\\" \\"try to explain,\\" etc. The verb \\"tried\\" does not collocate directly with a person; instead, it requires another phrase – specifically, a \\"to + verb\\" structure – to indicate the action that Mary attempted. The correct version would be \\"Mary tried to persuade John to go abroad.\\" This sentence properly conveys Mary's action (\\"tried\\" as a verb) and the intended outcome (\\"to persuade John to go abroad\\" as the infinitive verb). The original sentence appears to be an error caused by multiple reasons: 1. \\"tried John\\" implies that Mary attempted some action on John, but this usage is not appropriate for the verb \\"try.\\"  2. \\"to go abroad\\" is an arbitrary phrase that does not clearly state what the intended action is. There is no logical connection between \\"tried John\\" and \\"to go abroad.\\" In conclusion, a linguist would likely deem \\"Mary tried John to go abroad\\" as an invalid English sentence due to its incorrect use of the verb \\"try\\" and its lack of a proper structure to connect the subject, verb, and intended action. A more accurate sentence structure that conveys the intended message while adhering to standard grammatical conventions would be \\"Mary tried to persuade John to go abroad.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Why was there still a possibility of a shutdown?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Former Iranian president Rafsanjani ponders run in upcoming election Rafsanjani currently heads the Expediency Council, a powerful decision-making body made up of more than 70 senior members of the ruling system, many of them Shiite Muslim clerics. He is considered one of the Islamic Republic’s founding fathers and among its most powerful people. His announcement of a possible run in the June 14 contest adds a new dimension to an already muddled race. It poses a potential challenge to a field of conservative candidates who differ little from one another. But it also worries allies of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who hoped to capitalize on what they see as a lack of popular support for any of the conservatives. “If I am convinced that in the current situation my presence in the election would be beneficial to our system and the Islamic revolution and would help to solve our problems, I will participate without any hesitation,” Rafsanjani told students at Tehran University on Sunday. Even if Rafsanjani does not run, his endorsement of another candidate could alter the election landscape dramatically in Iran’s brief month-long campaign season, especially since there is no obvious front-runner. “Rafsanjani, together with others that he’s worked with on and off for decades, has the potential to mobilize. And pre-election mobilization in Iran can lead to unpredictable outcomes — as we saw in 2009,” said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council in Washington. Iran’s last presidential election in 2009 captured public interest just days before the vote was held. For many Iranians, Rafsanjani, believed to be one of the country’s wealthiest people, is also a symbol of the corruption that has plagued Iranian politics since long before the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Others see him as a pragmatic voice in the current political order who could help guide Iran out of its current problems and potentially mend relations with the United States. “A general belief has taken shape among a not negligible number of people inside Iran that Rafsanjani, despite his heavily checkered past, is a nationalist at heart who values the progress of Iran and wants to see it become a powerful country,” said Marashi. Rafsanjani would likely be the oldest candidate to run. An unsuccessful proposal to change election laws, including an age limit of 75, was widely viewed as a preemptive attempt by parliament to block Rafsanjani from entering the race. His flirtation with running, besides putting him back in the spotlight after two years of relative silence, could mean trouble for any Ahmadinejad-backed candidate. It has been widely expected that the incumbent’s preferred successor, top aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, would pick up support from many Iranians who voted for reformist candidates in previous elections and are disinclined to back one of the many traditionally conservative choices. Summary:","output":"A man named Rafsanjani, who is very important in Iran, is thinking about running for president in the upcoming election. This is interesting because he has a lot of influence and could change the results. Some people in Iran think Rafsanjani can make their country better, while others are worried because he is very old and has a history of being involved in corruption. If he decides to join the race, it could mean trouble for the current president's friend who also wants to be the next president."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: For many students in the UK today, deciding whether or not to go to university can be as much about affordability as it is about ambition and aspiration. In the past, students in the UK could apply to a university or college. They were sure that even if they came from a low income family, their tuition fees and some of their living (or maintenance) costs would be covered by a local authority grant . A university education was, in a financial sense, open to all and the number of students attending university grew yearly. Sadly, it seems, those days are long gone. The turning point came in 1998, when the Labour Government introduced tuition fees of PS1,000 a year and, instead of giving students a maintenance grant, asked them to cover their own living expenses with a repayable student loan. Only students on the lowest incomes were entitled to a grant. The flood gates had been opened. As time passed, the ceiling on tuition fees rose, and although applicants from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales still qualified for varying levels of subsidy , by 2009/10 students in England often found themselves facing tuition fees overPS3,000 a year. In 2011 the Government announced that, from 2012, universities could charge fees of up to PS9,000 a year. Although the Government by stating that postgraduates did not have to begin repaying their student loans until they were earning more than PS21,000 a year, the news created over-dissatisfaction. Many students argued that it was unfair that students should have to begin their work life loaded with huge debt, while others complained that the changes would bring back a class divide to university education. These views were reflected in the number of students applying for a university place, which by January 2012 fell by more than 22,000. The Universities Minister, David Willetts, stood by the decision to increase tuition fees, saying that they would not \\"put universities' finance on a bearable footing\\" and that they would accelerate \\"a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\\" Options: A 2 B 3 C 4 D 5 Answer: D 5 Question: Answer:","output":"Question: In the context of the article, how has the change in tuition fee policies impacted students and university education in the UK? A. Tuition fees have remained consistent, thus not affecting students' decisions to attend university. B. The introduction of higher tuition fees and a shift from maintenance grants to student loans has made a university education less accessible for some, leading to a decrease in applications and concerns about income-based barriers to education. C. Local authority grants still cover all tuition and maintenance costs, maintaining equal access to university education for all income groups. D. Recent changes in tuition fees have impacted only postgraduate students, leaving undergraduate education unaffected. Answer: B. The introduction of higher tuition fees and a shift from maintenance grants to student loans has made a university education less accessible for some, leading to a decrease in applications and concerns about income-based barriers to education."},{"instruction":"If amirror reflects sunlight, then what does a mirror reflect?

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Publicity  offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor  . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest. However, in 1985, publicity became so troublemaking that Procter & Gamble decided to remove the logo from its products.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The US Army is conducting a fighting retreat. A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up.  There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time. The remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting heavy losses and ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed, leaving only Dane, Todd, and a wounded Purckett alive. Purckett is shot, while Todd stabbed through the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead. Before he dies, Todd admits to Dane he is Burns.

I have a new situation: Two groups of patients were under observation for heart disease. The Red group was composed of people with low cholesterol, while the Yellow group was comprised of people with very high cholesterol.  But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  What is an answer for this question: Which group had more people with high blood pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the given background information, we can follow the following steps to analyze the situation and answer the question: 1.

Connect cholesterol and heart disease: Cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, which leads to plaque formation in the arteries, restricting blood flow. 3. Blood flow restriction and blood pressure: A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure. 4.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge? ?  Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.

All antidepressant drugs are not created equal, according to the authors of one of the few studies that have ever systematically analyzed and compared \\"new generation\\" medicines for treating depression. What qualities are important in an anti-depressant? Efficacy? Tolerance? Side effects? Cost? In the analysis of 12 drugs, two came out on top as the most effective and best tolerated as first-line treatments: sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro). Venlafaxine (Effexor) and mirtazapine (Remeron) rounded out the top four for effectiveness, but venlafaxine was also among the four drugs patients were most likely to quit taking because of side effects. Reboxetine (Edronax) was less effective than the rest. While psychiatrists treating depressed patients every day have had a sense of which medications are best, the current study \\"nails it,\\" says Sagar V. Parikh, M.D., of the University of Toronto. Parikh, who wrote a comment accompanying the study that is published in the current issue of The Lancet, says the findings have \\"enormous implications\\" because, for the first time, they offer doctors an evidence-based, unbiased way to recommend treatment. And, he adds, they give patients a \\"gold standard of reliable information,\\" especially since the study's authors plan to make their findings available free on the Web. Not so fast, says Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., M.P.H., who coauthored a review of the benefits and risks of the same 12 drugs published last November in the Annals of Internal Medicine. He and his colleagues concluded, based on their review done while Gartlehner was at the RTI-UNC Evidence-Based Practice Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.,  that there was no clinically meaningful evidence that any one of the drugs was better than the rest. Instead, they argued, decisions on which drug to use should be based on factors such as cost and side effects. In the current study, Andrea Cipriani, M.D., of the University of Verona in Italy, and colleagues used a new technique called multiple-treatments meta-analysis to make head-to-head comparisons among the 12 drugs, incorporating 117 randomized controlled trials including 25,928 patients in all. There has been little scientific evidence of the relative effectiveness of these drugs, because most studies compare one against a handful of others or a placebo, and are often funded by the maker of a particular drug, which can bias the findings in its favor, the researchers note. Health.com: How to brighten your winter mood. They used two measurements to gauge a drug's effectiveness and tolerability: the percentage of patients who showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms as measured by one of two scales, or who scored \\"much improved or very much improved\\" after eight weeks of treatment (or from  six to twelve weeks if eight-week data weren't available) and the percentage of patients who dropped out of the study before eight weeks for any reason. The 12 drugs included bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. The authors did not use any funding from drug manufacturers to conduct their study. \\"This is an unbiased approach to combining the maximum possible data and comparing a large number of drugs rather than one versus a select handful, so there's much more confidence in these findings,\\" says Parikh. Basically,  Parikh explains, Cipriani and colleagues were able to make comparisons among drugs that hadn't been studied head-to-head by using their effectiveness as compared with Prozac -- the best studied of these drugs -- as a kind of common currency. \\"There are limitations to the indirect approach used -- nonetheless, we think its the best available at present. The analysis will need to be updated regularly to include all new upcoming evidence,\\" Cipriani and coauthor John Geddes, M.D., director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Mental Health at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, said via e-mail. The findings don't mean that everyone should be put on Zoloft or Lexapro, and they shouldn't be seen as suggesting that people who are on other drugs should go off them, Cipriani and Geddes say. Health.com: 3 signs you should stop, adjust, or switch antidepressants. While it's good to have choices available since not everyone will benefit from a particular drug, there also seem to be a lot of \\"me too\\" products out there that offer no additional benefit but cost more, the authors add. They suggest that future studies should compare new antidepressants with sertraline, rather than to a placebo or a cherry-picked selection of other drugs. \\"Requiring new treatments to show either greater efficacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that offer little to patients other than increased costs,\\" they write. But according to Gartlehner, who is now with the Danube University in Krems, Austria, the approach Cipriani et. al. used has \\"serious downsides\\" that they did not acknowledge. Also, he argues, their use of odds ratios rather than relative risks led to overestimations of the differences among the various drugs. Health.com: Head-to-toe solutions for stress. \\"Most of these differences are statistically significant, but they're probably not clinically relevant,\\" Gartlehner said. \\"It's quite a stretch to say that...clinically important differences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants.\\" He and his colleagues did see differences among the drugs in side-effect profiles that could in fact be relevant to patients, Gartlehner said, and he argues that the finding that venlaxafine caused more nausea and vomiting while sertraline was associated with diarrhea, as well as the fact that some drugs must be taken several times a day while others can be taken less often, are important considerations, along with cost. But for Parikh, the differences in effectiveness and tolerability that Cipriani identified can make a real difference to patients. \\"The magnitude of these differences is not huge in terms of effectiveness. It's genuine, but it's modest,\\" Parikh said. \\"You can say to a patient, 'Do you want the strongest possible drug or do you want the one that's least likely to give you side effects, or do you want some balance?'\\" Health.com: Boost your mood naturally. He added, \\"It allows a dialogue to say, 'What suits you?'

They found that two medicines, called sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro), were the most effective and best tolerated for helping people feel better. It's important for an antidepressant to work well and have few side effects, but sometimes the cost of the medicine is also important to think about. However, doctors should also consider patients' preferences and needs when choosing which medicine to use. Just because a medicine works well for one person, it doesn't mean it'll work well for everyone, so doctors need to find the best option for each patient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Determine motivation Next, I would explore possible motivations or reasons for why Cameron might have sold the shoes at a lower price. This could include a desire to help someone else, financial troubles, a lack of understanding of the shoe's true value, or even a mistake or oversight during the sales process. Step 3: Examine the consequences I would then look at the consequences of Cameron's actions, both for Cameron and Sasha. Did Cameron benefit from selling the shoes at a lower price? Did Sasha suffer any financial loss or other negative impacts as a result? Step 4: Identify any external influences It's possible that external factors might have played a role in Cameron's decision to sell the shoes at a cheaper price.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Travis are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 1990, composed of Fran Healy (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dougie Payne (bass guitar, backing vocals), Andy Dunlop (lead guitar, banjo, backing vocals) and Neil Primrose (drums, percussion). The band's name comes from the Harry Dean Stanton character Travis Henderson from the film Paris, Texas. The band is widely claimed by the media as having paved the way for other bands such as Keane and Coldplay to go onto achieve worldwide success throughout the 2000s, particularly through the band's The Man Who (1999) album. The band released their debut album, Good Feeling (1997) to moderate success where it debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart and went onto achieve a silver certification from the BPI in January 2000. In 2002, however, things came to a halt for Travis, with the band almost calling it quits, after drummer Neil Primrose went head-first into a shallow swimming pool while on tour in France, just after a concert at Eurockeennes festival. Breaking his neck, he almost died due to spinal damage. If not for his road crew, he also would have drowned. Despite the severity of the accident, Primrose has since made a full recovery.  With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into a cottage in Crear, Argyll and Bute, they set up a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and political territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, \\"Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [Epic]. You just have to sit there and listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It's like an old album. It's like the Beatles' Revolver [1966]. Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful\\"--Elton John), singles such as \\"Re-Offender\\" did very well on the UK chart, and the album itself reached No. 3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.  In 2004, Travis embarked on a highly successful tour of Canada, the US, and Europe (supported by Keane in the UK), and on November 2004, the band released a successful compilation of their singles, Singles, as well as the new tracks, \\"Walking in the Sun\\" and \\"The Distance\\" (written by Dougie Payne). This was followed by a series of small, intimate gigs at UK venues such as Liverpool's Cavern Club, London's Mean Fiddler, and Glasgow's Barrowlands. While on tour, the band also made a series of impromptu acoustic \\"busks\\", raising money for the charity The Big Issue. In addition to other performances, they also headlined the 2005 Isle of Wight Festival and T in the Park.  On 2 July 2005, Travis performed at Live 8's London concert, and four days later, at the Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push concert. Travis also participated in Band Aid 20's re-recording of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\"--Healy and friend Nigel Godrich playing leading roles in its organisation. Healy is a part of the Make Poverty History movement, having recently made two trips to Sudan with the Save the Children organisation. On 13 July 2006, the members of Travis stuck a giant post-it sticker on the front door of the Downing Street home of British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. It read: \\"Tony Blair--Some steps forward, much to do at the G8, make poverty history.\\" is there anything else interesting about the accident?","output":"In the article, it talks about an accident that happened to Travis's drummer Neil Primrose.

Examples may include the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War or India and Pakistan in more recent times. Step 2: Analyze military strategy shifts Analyze changes in military strategies that emphasize the use of tactical nuclear weapons as a deterrent instead of relying on large-scale nuclear arsenals. This could involve examining shifts in the balance of power, arms race dynamics, or state doctrines to prioritize tactical nuclear weapons over other types of nuclear weapons. Step 3: Highlight international treaties and agreements Present evidence that supports the role of tactical nuclear weapons in providing security to states and helping in nuclear disarmament. For example, examine initiatives like the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Highlight the specific articles or provisions that emphasize the development and possession of tactical nuclear weapons as a deterrent, while working towards decommissioning other forms of nuclear weapons. Step 4: Explore expert opinions and analysis Research studies, articles, and expert opinions that support the idea that possession of tactical nuclear weapons increases security and promotes the decommissioning of larger arsenals. These analyses may provide insight into the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons, their impact on global security, and their role in preventing the use of larger-scale nuclear weapons. Step 5: Review case studies and models Investigate case studies of individual countries that possess tactical nuclear weapons and have considered or taken steps towards decommissioning their larger nuclear arsenals. Analyze how these countries' governments have weighed the benefits and drawbacks of maintaining different types of nuclear weapons, and how the possession of tactical nuclear weapons has influenced their decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).  Story: Redland and Brownland were two countries situated at different latitudes. Redland was located at 70 degrees N, while Brownland was much further south, at 30 degrees N. Brownland had no mountains, only a few hills under 1000 ft.  Question: Which country had less alpine tundra?","output":"Part #1: Background paragraph introduces a relationship.

Part #2: A story utilizing the concepts or relationships in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Redland and Brownland were two countries situated at different latitudes. Redland was located at 70 degrees N, while Brownland was much further south, at 30 degrees N.

Part #3: A question related to the story that requires an understanding of the relationship from the background paragraph.

Here is an article: Owning your “I’m a rock star” status in the office is a learned skill. Honing your confidence as a budding entrepreneur is another homework assignment altogether. This is more than your elevator pitch, polished website and unforgettable business card. This is the heart of your operation. As soon as I officially decided that I would transform my passions into the brand that is me, I suddenly felt pressure to be “on” at all times. When what you do and who you are become one in the same, it’s an incredibly phenomenal experience, but it also means that you should be able to speak concisely and effectively about it without (too much) hesitation. For me, this evolution involved countless stumbles and hiccups, and I can’t say that I’m totally prepared if any cocktail party were thrown my way. But I’ve definitely climbed the learning curve of self-confidence, and this is what I’ve learned: No. 1: It’s okay not to know it all When you’re creating your business the expectation is that you’re an expert in that field. As a writer, I feel like I should know every rule of grammar as if it were my last name. Now that’s a daunting task. The relief is knowing that we are all developing ourselves and feeling out the unknown of the road ahead with our hands and our intuition. There is no shame in replying to a question you can’t answer with a simple, “You raise a great point. I’m going to poke around further and get back to you.” There is no need to be the know-it-all in the room. Frankly, nobody knows it all, and that’s the fun of thriving and surviving as an entrepreneur. But the more comfortable you become with accepting your current knowledge limitations, the more confident you will become as a work-in-progress representation of your brand. No. 2: You don’t have to be best friends with everyone When every person you encounter is a potential client then it may be easy to feel like you have to bring nothing less than your A-game to the conversation. But you will never learn to strut your real stuff on the walkway of entrepreneurship if you’re always dropping a fake smile and trying to cozy up to the next so-and-so. It’s a wise move to be open to meeting people you wouldn’t normally interact with, but by all means don’t feel like you have to be a larger-than-life version of yourself to attract an audience. Just be who you are, that’s who people want to do business with, even if you’re quirky and coloring outside the lines, especially if you’re quirky and coloring outside the lines. No. 3: Over-preparation is not the key My natural inclination is to want to create to-do list after to-do list until I’ve mapped out every fine detail of a potentially bumpy situation. If I smooth out the bumps now then the path ahead is sure to be smooth, right? It’s a false illusion of safety, a storyline which has only given me a fleeting sense of peace. So how have I turned that storyline on its head? I let it go. Yes, I do preliminary work to set myself up for success. But then I just release it into the hands of the universe. If we’re really honest with ourselves then we know it’s out of our control. So we may as well surrender the meeting, the interview, the negotiation, the book deal, and open ourselves up to the flow of the moment. Living in the flow has been my greatest confidence booster to date. Confidence doesn’t grow on trees, nor can you buy it on Amazon, discover it in a significant other, or pick it up at a regional sales meeting in a hotel conference room. Confidence in entrepreneurship is in you right here, right now. Just start peeling back the layers. You won’t believe the “you” that’s waiting to be unleashed.

The answer is:","output":"When the wind begins to blow faster, the size of the waves at the beach will increase. This is because the size of an ocean wave is dependent on three factors: the speed of the wind, the distance over which the wind blows (also known as the fetch), and the duration for which the wind blows. When the wind speed increases, it imparts more energy to the water surface, resulting in bigger waves. The greater each of these factors is, the larger the waves will be.

Summarize this article: It's important for your students to know that they can trust you as an expert in your field.  When you introduce yourself, tell them how many years you've been working in your field and what you have achieved there. Then they'll know you know your stuff. Tell them how long you've been teaching your course. If you've been teaching the same course twenty times, let them know, so they have a sense that you've created the best course possible. If you're new to the classroom, however, don't let your students know so they don't see you as a pushover. Once the introductions are out of the way, it's important to let your students understand your expectations so they can meet them.  Have a well-organized syllabus that shows them exactly what to expect from every day of the course. Answer any questions they have after you go over it, so you can clear up any confusion. Whether you're teaching children or adults, it's important to have a clear code of conduct, which shows not only your expectations, but the punishments if your students fail to meet them. Common code of conduct rules include showing mutual respect and avoiding disruptive behavior, such as using texting, talking on the phone, or whispering in the back of the classroom. Whether you're giving a quiz or a final exam, it's important to make sure the assignment is fair and useful for your students. They will be better students after all of your hard work, and will thank you for being an understanding teacher and classroom leader.  Have a study guide. Before an exam, tell your students what they can expect to be on it so they don't have any surprises on the day of the test. Provide sample problems. Give your students practice problems so their skills are sharp on the day of the test. To be a good classroom leader, you have to find new ways to introduce boring old material to your students. If you don't mix things up, your students will get bored and distracted and may even lose respect for you.  Bring current events into class discussion. Even if you're not teaching a history class, you can find a way to bring up current events, whether it's something related to the government or sports, and tie them into your material. This will make your students feel that your discussion is relevant to the real world. Have unique activities that get your students moving and thinking. Allow your students to create their own paragraphs, board work, skits, or any other activity that may help them understand an old concept in a new way. To be a good classroom leader, you have to prove that you care about your students' success. Be kind and approachable in the classroom, so they respect you but aren't afraid to ask questions.  Give good feedback on both written assignments as well as your students' in-class responses. This will show that you care about them on an individual level and want them to succeed. Thank them for a great class. On the last day of class, bring them a special treat, or write them a note to say how much you've enjoyed having them in the classroom. This will make your classroom experience end on a positive note and will show what a great leader you are.","output":"To establish yourself as a trusted expert and effective classroom leader, start by introducing your credentials and experience in your field.

Tweet:not going out with boobie luv anymore","output":"To analyze the sentiment of the given tweet, we must first break it down and understand the context and meaning behind the words. The tweet reads, \\"not going out with boobie luv anymore.\\"  At first glance, the tweet appears to convey mixed sentiment. The user mentions that they are no longer going out with someone they refer to as \\"boobie luv.\\" This nickname seems to be a playful and affectionate term, suggesting that the user might have had positive feelings toward this person. The positive sentiment can be seen in the use of the word \\"luv,\\" which is a casual and familiar way of expressing love or affection. However, the central message of the tweet is the announcement that the user is no longer going out with this person. The phrase \\"not going out\\" generally signifies the end of a relationship or a change in the status of a social connection. When something like this occurs, it usually carries negative emotions due to the loss of companionship or the end of a meaningful relationship. In this particular case, we can't exactly pinpoint the cause of the relationship's end or the reasons behind the user's decision. It may have been a mutual decision or a result of unforeseen circumstances, but regardless, the tweet implies the end of a connection with someone the user held in high regard. In conclusion, the tweet has a mixed sentiment. While the use of the affectionate nickname \\"boobie luv\\" suggests some positive feelings, the core message of the tweet indicates the end of a relationship or connection, resulting in negative emotions like sadness, disappointment, or loss."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Process:  - You start with a glacier - Through warming or other methods a chunk is taken off the glacier - The chunk drifts into the sea - And it settles where it can remain in its state - It is considered an iceberg.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose colder temperatures at the glaciers happens, how will it affect more chunks drift into the sea.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which brings focus to the potential impact of colder temperatures on the glacier and its subsequent effect on the calving and drifting process of icebergs, can indeed have both direct and indirect implications on the process. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced glacier calving: Colder temperatures at the glacier would likely promote the growth and stability of the ice mass. This may lead to a decrease in the rate of chunks breaking off of the glacier and drifting into the sea, as the enhanced stability reduces the susceptibility of the glacier to factors that induce calving, such as temperature fluctuations, ocean currents, and wind. 2. Reduced glacier melting: The decrease in temperature might also contribute to reducing the surface melting of the glacier, which in turn may reduce the water flow through the glacier's crevasses. This can inhibit the occurrence of the process known as hydrofracturing, where water infiltrates crevasses and causes the ice to break apart, thus reducing the formation of icebergs. Indirect Effects: 1. Change in ocean circulation: Colder temperatures can also impact the ocean currents near the glacier. The alteration in the density of water and temperature gradient can lead to changes in ocean circulation patterns, which might ultimately affect the transportation of icebergs once they drift into the sea. This could result in varying distributions of icebergs across different regions, which may affect shipping routes, coastal ecosystems, and global ocean circulation patterns. 2. Modification of precipitation patterns: Colder temperatures around the glacier might lead to changes in atmospheric circulation, influencing the patterns of snowfall and precipitation in the region. This can have a two-fold effect on iceberg calving. On the one hand, increased snowfall could contribute to a higher rate of ice accumulation in the glacier, promoting more calving events. Conversely, decreased precipitation could diminish ice accumulation and yield a reduction in calving rates. 3. Impact on ecosystems and species: The perturbation hypothesis would also imply impacts on ecosystems and species that are adapted to live around glaciers and icebergs. As colder temperatures have the potential to alter ice formations and the overall pattern of iceberg occurrence, it is probable that organisms that have specialized behavioral and physiological adaptations to these environmental conditions would also be affected, both directly and indirectly. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of colder temperatures at the glacier can indeed have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the calving process of icebergs and the ensuing iceberg drifting dynamics. The colder temperatures can influence the physical properties and melting rates of the glacier, ocean circulation patterns, precipitation patterns, and ecosystems surrounding the glacier and iceberg drifts. Consequently, it is crucial to consider the potential implications of such perturbations in the context of climate change and the overall functioning of Earth's cryosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are past statements where the presidential hopeful neglected to take personal responsibility for the controversy. (The Washington Post)      During an interview with ABC News, Hillary Clinton apologized for using a private e-mail server during her time as secretary or state. Here are past statements where the presidential hopeful neglected to take personal responsibility for the controversy. (The Washington Post)      A technology subcontractor that has worked on Hillary Rodham Clinton’s e-mail setup expressed concerns over the summer that the system was inadequately protected and vulnerable to hackers, a company official said Wednesday.      But the concerns were rebuffed by the company managing the Clinton account, Platte River Networks, which said it had been instructed by the FBI not to make changes. The FBI has been reviewing the security of the e-mail system.      The subcontractor, Datto, which specializes in backing up data, had not been aware that it was handling Clinton e-mails until media reports in August noted Platte River Networks’ involvement with the controversy surrounding the former secretary of state’s e-mails.      Datto officials, worried about the “sensitive high profile nature of the data,” then recommended upgrading security by adding sophisticated encryption technology to its backup systems, said the Datto official, who requested anonymity to discuss an issue involving a client.      The Datto official said there is no evidence the company’s systems had been attacked.      1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Takeaways from Hillary Clinton’s e-mails View Photos Clinton has come under fire for using a private e-mail address during her time as secretary of state.

Caption Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state. The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them. Top-secret information in e-mails Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has previously stated that classified information never traveled across her private server. However, the State Department has acknowledged that \\"top secret\\" information was in seven email chains sent or received by her. Richard Drew/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      A Platte River Networks spokesman acknowledged receiving upgrade requests from Datto.      “It’s not that we ignored them, but the FBI had told us not to change or adjust anything,” the spokesman, Andy Boian, said.      Boian said, however, the company did not take Datto’s concerns to the FBI.      An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.      The concerns expressed by Datto reflected worry that the system, which was still in use for the Clintons’ personal office in August, could have been vulnerable to hackers who targeted it for its new notoriety amid the swirling controversy.      They also suggested potential security gaps dating back to when the company was first hired, in May 2013, possibly putting at risk material from Clinton’s time as secretary of state that the company believes it might have stored since that time.      And it points to a larger question, being posed by Republican lawmakers, of whether Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, jeopardized national security by using a private system that lacked top-level security protocols that would be expected of a high-level government official.      Both Platte River, based in Denver, and Datto, in Connecticut, typically service small-business clients and have limited experience with sensitive government information.      Clinton and her aides have said that government secrets were never put at risk. Asked about Datto’s concerns, Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, pointed to the company’s assurance that Clinton’s data had not been hacked.      A Clinton aide, requesting anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said the Clintons instructed Datto and Platte River to fully cooperate with the FBI. The Clinton aide also said the arrangement between Platte River Networks and Datto was “negotiated by the two companies, not the Clintons.”      Officials have said that Clinton is not a target of the FBI inquiry. Investigators took possession of a server from the Denver-based Platte River server in August, and Datto told The Washington Post this week that it had arranged to hand over hardware used by the company to back up e-mail data in its cloud.      The probe has exposed a disagreement between Platte River and Datto about whether the subcontractor’s backups are likely to have stored material from the time Clinton served as secretary of state. Datto believes it is possible; Platte River has said it is unlikely.      A security breach would have been less serious if Datto held none of Clinton’s government records.      The dispute also relates to the likelihood that investigators might be able to retrieve from Datto’s equipment at least some of the 31,000 e-mails from Clinton’s time as secretary that she deemed personal and has since deleted.      Clinton in December handed over about 30,000 e-mails to the State Department that she said were related to her official duties. But some GOP lawmakers have questioned whether Clinton had deleted additional work e-mails along with her personal correspondence and have called for the deleted e-mails to be recovered.      Carol D. Leonnig contributed to this report.      This story has been updated to include a quote from a Clinton aide addressing the Clintons’ role in the negotiations between Datto and Platte River Networks. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Rodham Clinton's private email server, which stored some 55,000 pages of emails from her time as secretary of state, was the subject of attempted cyberattacks originating in China, South Korea and Germany after she left office in early 2013, according to a congressional document obtained by The Associated Press.      While the attempts were apparently blocked by a \\"threat monitoring\\" product that Clinton's employees connected to her network in October 2013, there was a period of more than three months from June to October 2013 when that protection had not been installed, according to a letter from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. That means her server was possibly vulnerable to cyberattacks during that time.      Johnson's letter to Victor Nappe, CEO of SECNAP, the company that provided the threat monitoring product, seeks a host of documents relating to the company's work on Clinton's server and the nature of the cyber intrusions detected. Johnson's committee is investigating Clinton's email arrangement.      Clinton has not said what, if any, firewall or threat protection was used on her email server before June 2013, including the time she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the server was kept in her home in the New York City suburbs.      A February 2014 email from SECNAP reported that malicious software based in China \\"was found running an attack against\\" Clinton's server. In total, Senate investigators have found records describing three such attempts linked to China, one based in Germany and one originating in South Korea. The attacks occurred in 2013 and 2014. The letter describes four attacks, but investigators have since found records about a fifth attempt, said officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.      It was not immediately clear whether the attempted intrusions into Clinton's server were serious espionage threats or the sort of nuisance attacks that hit computer servers the world over. But the new revelations underscore the extent to which any private email server is a target, raising further questions about Clinton's decision to undertake sensitive government business over private email stored on a homemade system.      Any hackers who got access to her server in 2013 or 2014 could have stolen a trove of sensitive email traffic involving the foreign relations of the United States. Thousands of Clinton emails made public under the Freedom of Information Act have been heavily redacted for national security and other reasons.      Clinton \\"essentially circumvented millions of dollars' worth of cybersecurity investment that the federal government puts within the State Department,\\" said Justin Harvey, chief security officer of Fidelis Cybersecurity.      \\"She wouldn't have had the infrastructure to detect or respond to cyber attacks from a nation-state,\\" he said. \\"Those attacks are incredibly sophisticated, and very hard to detect and contain. And if you have a private server, it's very likely that you would be compromised.\\"      A spokesman for the Clinton campaign did not answer detailed questions from The Associated Press about the cyber intrusions. Instead, spokesman Brian Fallon attacked Johnson by linking him to the House Benghazi committee inquiry, which the campaign dismissed in a recent media ad as politically motivated.      \\"Ron Johnson is ripping a page from the House Benghazi Committee's playbook and mounting his own, taxpayer-funded sham of an investigation with the sole purpose of attacking Hillary Clinton politically,\\" campaign spokesman Fallon said by email. \\"The Justice Department is already conducting a review concerning the security of her server equipment, and Ron Johnson has no business interfering with it for his own partisan ends.\\"      The FBI is investigating whether national security was compromised by Clinton's email arrangement.      In June 2013, after Clinton had left office, the server was moved from her Chappaqua, New York, home to a data center in northern New Jersey, where it was maintained by a Denver technology company, Platte River Networks, records show.      In June 2013, Johnson's letter says, Platte River hired SECNAP Network Security Corp. to use a product called CloudJacket SMB, which is designed to block network access by \\"even the most determined hackers,\\" according to company literature. But the product was not up and running until October, according to Johnson's letter, raising questions about how vulnerable Clinton's server was during the interim.      SECNAP is not a well-known computer security provider. The company's website and promotional literature describe CloudJacket as a monitoring system designed to counter unauthorized intrusions and monitor threats around the clock. Corporate documents show SECNAP has been in existence since at least 2002, selling computer spam filter and firewall products.      A SECNAP representative declined to comment, citing company policy.      The AP reported last month that Russia-linked hackers sent Clinton emails in 2011 — when she was still secretary of state — loaded with malware that could have exposed her computer if she opened the attachments. It is not known if she did.      The attacks Johnson mentions in his letter are different, according to government officials familiar with them. They were probing Clinton's server directly, not through email.      ___      Follow Ken Dilanian on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KenDilanianAP ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief statement or account that explains the main points or important details of something. So, in this case, I can give you a short explanation of the article you provided. Hillary Clinton apologized for using a private email server when she was the Secretary of State, which means she was using a personal email address for her work instead of an official government email address. There were concerns that her email system was not well protected against hackers, who could try to get access to her private information. But her email system was checked and there is no proof that it was ever attacked. Some people are still worried that using a private email address could have put the country's important information at risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Great Bao is a hole in the wall extraordinaire.  It's located in the most unique location of all - in a small corner of a beauty salon.  In my opinion, Chef Sheridan takes the approach much like IN-N-OUT, taking a few items and doing it right.  Of course the restaurant names says it all on his most popular items, but he also serves other delicious sides.  On his bao's: Have you ever been to a family dinner where you had the peking duck served with only 8 fluffy baos to 10 people, so you really couldn't indulge in the juicy meat with the light and sweet bao?  Here at Great Bao, you can definitely get as many bao's as you want and NOT have to share.  Hubbie and I tried the duck, beef and pork belly.  The pork belly bao was my favorite - it was juicy and warm.  The duck bao was my next favorite.  Chef makes it so that there is a little bit of crispy skin to tease you to want more.  I also overheard that he gets his bao's baked fresh from a local bakery, so no, no, they are NOT pre-packaged or frozen.  The other goods: His sesame noodles are a light and tangy.

One soldier, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), decides to show just what Irons' weapons can do and sets one of Irons' sonic cannons at the highest power setting, firing the device at an abandoned building. However, the weapon backfires and destroys the building the team is situated in. Irons' partner, Susan \\"Sparky\\" Sparks (Annabeth Gish), is crushed by a large slab of concrete in the ensuing chaos. In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a video arcade manager to help him carry out this deed. Irons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals. With the help of Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree), they forge a suit of armor and the weaponry necessary for Irons to carry out his war on crime and become the vigilante \\"Steel\\". However, during his crusade against crime, Irons is pursued by the cops and is forced to return to his lair. The next night, the robbers arrange to rob another bank.

We have the equation: -6*q = -16*q + 30 Imagine q as a number of toys. So we have -6 times the number of toys equaling -16 times the number of toys plus 30. We want to find out how many toys (q) we have. 1. First, let's move all the q terms (the toy terms) to one side of the equation. To do this, we add 16*q to both sides to get rid of the -16*q on the right side.        -6*q + 16*q = -16*q + 16*q + 30 2. Now we simplify.     10*q = 30 3. We have 10 times the number of toys equaling 30. To find out the number of toys (q), we need to divide both sides by 10.    10*q / 10 = 30 / 10 4. Lastly, we simplify it again.    q = 3 So, q (or the number of toys) is 3. Great job!"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

Answer the question:   If Milo is growing a certain type of bacteria that can resist antibiotics and he increases the amount of bacteria he is growing, would mutations in the bacteria increase or decrease? The answer to this question is:","output":"If Milo increases the amount of bacteria he is growing, the number of mutations in the bacteria will increase. Step 1: Understand the situation. Milo is growing a type of bacteria that can resist antibiotics. As bacteria multiply and reproduce, mutations can naturally occur, including those that help resist antibiotics.

This is because there will be more instances of cell division, which is when mutations can happen. Step 3: Consider the specific mutation in question. In this case, we are focusing on the mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. As the bacterial population grows, it is expected that this mutation will also become more common due to the increased number of cell divisions occurring. Step 4: Answer the question.

The correct answer to the question is \\"no.\\" It's important to carefully analyze the provided premise and hypothesis to determine if there is any logical entailment or if the statements contradict each other. The premise asserting that GPRA is the primary framework stands against the hypothesis claiming the opposite, resulting in this contradiction. Further, the GPRA's purpose is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs by establishing a system for agencies to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report their accomplishments. Since the legislation's implementation in 1993, it has been consistently reinforced and updated by follow-up legislation and executive orders, strengthening its central role in government performance management. So, when evaluating the premise and the above-mentioned context, it reinforces the conclusion that, indeed, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In summary, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) is positioned as the primary legislative framework focused on strategic goals, performance measuring, and reporting in the federal government. Consequently, the hypothesis claiming the contrary lacks substantial grounds based on the information provided within the premise itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Following the Denver Broncos loss on Thursday night to the San Diego Chargers, the Raiders looked to move into sole possession of first place in the AFC West as they hosted the Kansas City Chiefs. Things began well for the Raiders as Jalen Richard returned the opening kick 50 yards and Derek Carr hit Andre Holmes for a three-yard touchdown pass to put the Raiders up 7-0. However, the struggling Raiders defense continued to have problems stopping opponents as the Chiefs scored on a two-yard touchdown run by Spencer Ware and a four-yard run by Jamaal Charles (extra point failed), putting the Chiefs in front 13-7. The Raiders were able to get a field goal from Sebastian Janikowski as the half ended to pull within 13-10. However, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, who is 16-2 in his career coming off of bye weeks, continued to baffle the Raiders defense in the second half. The Chiefs added a one-yard run by defensive lineman Dontari Poe and two field goals by Cairo Santos to go up 26-10. The Raiders offense managed nothing in the second half and the Chiefs won 26-10. The Chiefs offense put up 406 yards on the hapless Raiders defense. The Raiders fell to 4-2 on the season and back into a first place tie with the Broncos.

If \\"A dune buggy goes down a hill.\\", does this mean that \\"The dune buggy is about to turn.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A dune buggy goes down a hill\\" does not explicitly imply that \\"The dune buggy is about to turn.\\" To better understand this, let's break down each statement and analyze them. In the first statement, \\"A dune buggy goes down a hill,\\" we learn several pieces of information: 1. The subject is a dune buggy, which is a lightweight vehicle designed for off-road use, often on sand or difficult terrain. 2. The action described is \\"go down a hill,\\" which means the dune buggy is currently moving downhill. However, no specific information about the direction, path, or future actions of the dune buggy is provided. The dune buggy could be going straight down the hill, or it might be navigating a winding path that includes turns. Now let's consider the second statement, \\"The dune buggy is about to turn.\\"  This indicates that the dune buggy will soon change its direction or follow a curve in its path. However, the first statement does not provide any information about the dune buggy's upcoming actions or specific route. It only explains that the dune buggy is going down a hill. Of course, it is possible that the dune buggy will turn while going down the hill. In reality, it is common for vehicles to have to make turns when moving downhill, particularly in hilly or mountainous terrain, where winding roads are often necessary. However, this possibility is not explicitly stated nor guaranteed in the original statement, \\"A dune buggy goes down a hill.\\" In conclusion, the statement \\"A dune buggy goes down a hill\\" does not necessarily mean that \\"The dune buggy is about to turn.\\" While it is possible that the dune buggy might have to make a turn while going downhill, the initial statement does not provide enough information to determine this with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The world number five saw off a chasing pack that included Masters and US Open champion Jordan Spieth, who finished three shots back in second place. That was enough to ensure the American, 22, replaces Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, 26, as world number one. South African Branden Grace was third on 15 under and Justin Rose of England finished fourth on 14 under after his challenge faded with a double bogey on the 13th. McIlroy closed with a 69 to end his first tournament back from an ankle injury at nine under par. Day had previously recorded nine top-10 finishes in the majors, six of them in the top four, but held his nerve superbly to finally get his hands on one of golf's leading trophies. His final score of 20 under par broke Tiger Woods's major record of 19 under at the 2000 Open Championship. The Queenslander began the final day with a two-stroke lead and made four birdies before the first blip came at the eighth hole. Despite the ominous presence of Spieth alongside him in the final group, Day recovered from a desperate mishit on the ninth to pick up further birdies on the 11th and 14th. He then responded immediately to a dropped shot at 15 with his seventh birdie of the day, and played the treacherous closing two holes superbly. \\"I didn't expect I was going to cry,\\" said Day. \\"A lot of emotion has come out just because I've been close so many times and fallen short. \\"To be able to play the way I did today in tough conditions with Jordan in the group - he was the favourite - to be able to play the way I did was amazing. \\"Overall I'm just really pleased with how I played. I couldn't ask for anything better.\\" Spieth might have come agonisingly close to becoming the first man to win all three American majors in the same year, but he had plenty to smile about. With McIlroy back in 17th place, Spieth had done enough to replace the defending PGA champion at the top of the new world rankings. \\"It's as good a consolation prize as I've ever had,\\" said Spieth, whose major finishes this year read first, first, fourth and second. \\"It was not easy to dethrone Rory and it's going to be even harder to try and stay on top.\\" McIlroy, who had not played since the US Open in June after rupturing an ankle ligament playing football with friends, said Spieth was a worthy number one. \\"Honestly, the way Jordan has been playing and the way I haven't played much this year - I think that was only my 12th or 13th event - it's very deservedly so,\\" said McIlroy. \\"Winning two majors, winning a couple of other times this year, had a chance at the Open, had a chance today. \\"I'd be the first one to congratulate him because I know the golf you have to play to get to that spot, and it has been impressive this year.\\" Among the many stellar names looking to reel in Day, it was unheralded world number 28 Grace who got closest when he moved with one shot after a birdie at the seventh. Day responded to the danger with three straight birdies, however, and was never again fewer than two shots in front. Dustin Johnson had hopes of challenging from six shots back at the start of the day, but a horrendous quadruple bogey at the first heralded a bizarre round that saw him drop four shots in the first six holes, and then make five birdies and an eagle in the next eight. It all added up to a round of 69, a share of seventh place and another major letdown for the world number eight. Rose looked to be moving into serious contention after four birdies took him to 16 under par by the 11th, only for a double bogey on 13 to effectively end his challenge. German Martin Kaymer fell away with a double bogey on the sixth, while the likes of Anirban Lahiri of India, South African George Coetzee and Americans Brooks Koepka and Matt Kuchar were too far behind to worry Day, despite fine rounds.

Assess the situation - determine how much ash needs to be cleaned and the type of surface from which the ash needs to be removed. In this case, it is assumed that the ash comes from a grill. 2. Choose the best method for ash removal - compare available options and their potential effectiveness. Option a is \\"put a layer of toilet paper at the bottom of the grill,\\" and option b is \\"put a layer of foil at the bottom of the grill.\\" 3. Justify the selected method: a) Toilet paper is an absorbent material, but it is not heat resistant and might catch fire if it comes into contact with hot ash. Therefore, it is not suitable for removing ash from a grill. b) A layer of foil on the bottom of the grill can provide an efficient and safe way to collect ash. It is heat resistant, easy to remove and won't catch fire, making it the ideal choice. 4. Implement the chosen method - place a layer of foil at the bottom of the grill before using it. This will collect ash and make cleaning easier. 5. Clean up - after usage, let the grill cool down completely to ensure safety during the cleaning process. Remove the foil layer that has collected the ash. Dispose of the ash and used foil responsibly. In conclusion, the best way to clean up ashes in this scenario is option b (putting a layer of foil at the bottom of the grill), as it provides a more practical, safe, and efficient way to collect and remove ashes from the grill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What can develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized?\\" given the answer choices provided is Candida. Candida is a type of fungus, and fungi are known to reproduce both sexually and asexually. In the asexual reproduction process, fungi produce haploid spores that can develop into new haploid individuals without the need for fertilization. This method of reproduction is an adaptation that allows fungi to spread quickly and colonize new environments rapidly. The other answer choices do not fit the criteria as described in the question. Bacteria, alpacas, cows, insects, orchids, and ferns have different reproductive strategies, and they are not known to develop into haploid individuals without fertilization (except for some specific groups of insects and plants, but these are not representative of the entire group). Parasites, on the other hand, are a broad category that includes a variety of organisms with different reproductive methods, but as a whole, they are not a suitable answer to the question. In conclusion, Candida is the most accurate answer choice because it is a type of fungus, and fungi spores have the ability to develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized. This characteristic distinguishes fungi from the other answer choices provided and makes Candida the best answer in this case."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Find a clean plastic bag: You'll need a plastic bag that can be sealed, like a ziplock bag, to hold the ice pack contents. 2. Mix water and rubbing alcohol: In a bowl, mix 2 cups of water and 1 cup of rubbing alcohol. The rubbing alcohol helps the ice pack stay cold longer and makes it more flexible when it's frozen. 3. Add some color (optional): If you want to make your ice pack colorful and fun, you can add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture. Just remember that it can stain clothes, so be careful! 4. Pour the mixture into the plastic bag: Carefully pour the water and rubbing alcohol mixture into the plastic bag. Don't fill it up all the way, because the mixture will expand when it freezes. 5. Seal the bag: Make sure the bag is tightly sealed so that the liquid doesn't leak out. You can even double-bag it by putting the first bag inside another sealed plastic bag for extra protection. 6. Freeze the ice pack: Put the bag in the freezer for a few hours or until it's nice and cold. 7.

An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position?  Question: \\"Is an object with mechanical energy always moving?\\" Answer: \\"No\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Select from: [I] no [II] yes","output":"Answer: \\"II\\" yes The answer to the question \\"Is an object with mechanical energy always moving?\\" is \\"No,\\" and the statement that an object with mechanical energy is not always moving is correct. Mechanical energy includes both kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy due to position). For example, a compressed spring has potential energy that can later be converted into kinetic energy when the spring is released.

They both love the holiday season and look forward to it every year. Although they celebrate different holidays - Katrina celebrates Christmas and Tanya celebrates Hanukkah - they enjoy learning about each other's traditions and culture.  With the holiday season just around the corner, Katrina started preparing her house for Christmas. She put up a beautifully decorated Christmas tree in the living room and hung sparkling fairy lights outside the house. Katrina's family enjoyed singing Christmas carols and baking sweet cookies in different shapes together, like stars, snowmen, and bells, to share with their friends and neighbors. At the same time, Tanya and her family were also preparing to celebrate Hanukkah, an eight-day Jewish festival of lights. They decorated their living room with a special candelabrum called a menorah, which holds nine candles. Each night of Hanukkah, Tanya's family lit a new candle and said special prayers to remember a miracle that happened long, long ago. Tanya and her family also loved to cook delicious foods together, like yummy potato pancakes called latkes, and sweet jelly-filled doughnuts called sufganiyot. Even though Katrina and Tanya were from different backgrounds and celebrated different holidays, both girls were very curious about each other's customs and festivities. They thought it would be so much fun to learn even more by inviting each other to their houses to celebrate together, and share their holiday traditions with each other. So, Katrina invited Tanya and her family over for Christmas Eve dinner. Tanya was so excited to try the Christmas cookies and see all the beautiful decorations. She and her family felt very welcome as they sang carols and exchanged gifts with Katrina's family. Then, Tanya invited Katrina and her family to join them for one of the nights of Hanukkah. Katrina marveled at the menorah and enjoyed the taste of the delicious latkes and sufganiyot. She even played the dreidel game with Tanya, where they spun a small spinning top with four sides, each marked with a different Hebrew letter. By sharing their holidays with each other, Katrina and Tanya learned not only about each other's customs and beliefs, but they also realized that both families enjoyed spending time together, eating delicious food, and sharing love and kindness during the festive season.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Wajahat S. Khan      ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A powerful constitutional body in Pakistan proposed legislation last week that would allow husbands to \\"lightly beat\\" their wives who decline sex or refuse to wear what their mates prefer.      The Council of Islamic Ideology says it has to finalize the 160-page draft before it is sent to lawmakers in the Punjab province, the country's most populated region, for approval.      As well as beatings for wives who decline to have sex with their husbands, the document also advocates men use \\"limited violence\\" on spouses who do not bathe after intercourse or during menstruation.      \\"Do not hit her vindictively, but only for reminding her about her religious duties\\"      The council — known as CII — went so far as to provide guidelines on how to inflict the beatings.      \\"Hit her in areas where her skin is not too thick and not too thin,\\" CII leader Maulana Muhammad Khan Sherani told a press conference in Islamabad on Thursday. \\"Do not use shoes or a broom on the head, or hit her on the nose or eyes.\\"      \\"Do not break any bones or cut her skin or leave any marks,\\" he added. \\"Do not hit her vindictively, but only for reminding her about her religious duties.\\"      Moulana Mohammad Khan Sherani Chairman of Council of Islamic Ideology in Pakistan. National Assembly of Pakistan / National Assembly of Pakistan      The CII cannot make laws itself but gives suggestions to Pakistan's government and parliament.      Already, the proposal has sparked outrage inside the country.      \\"This is unbelievable,\\" said Allama Tahir Ashrafi, a former member of the CII who resigned for what he called religious regions. \\"So, what is 'light beating' and 'limited violence'? Not chopping off their heads but only, say, burning them in oil?\\"      Ashrafi is now leader of the 110,000-member Pakistani Religious Scholars Council, a group of mullahs who debate Islam and preach.      He told NBC News the CII was subverting the very religion it claimed to uphold: \\"Violence is forbidden by Islam, period.\\"      He said the council should be speaking \\"about rape, about the increasing divorce rate, about suicide bombing — but they avoid these issues.\\"      \\"Violence is forbidden by Islam, period\\"      Others have questioned the practicality of the proposals.      \\"Will the Maulana [religious scholar] observe every beating himself, personally?\\" said Rana Sanaullah, the Punjab province law minister, in another press conference in Lahore. \\"How will he ensure that 'light beating' doesn't become 'heavy beating'.\\"      The draft bill has a step-by-step guide on how to administer these beatings. If a wife disobeys her husband, according to the document, the husband should try to talk to her. If that doesn't work, he should sleep separately and only finally use violence as a last resort.      The CII suggests that any man who doesn't follow that process should be prosecuted.      Related: Malala Becomes Lightning Rod For Anger in Hometown      Pakistan was the first Islamic country to elect a woman to high office, with Benazir Bhutto serving as prime minister in the 80s and 90s before her assassination in 2007. However it consistently ranks as one of the world's worst countries for female employment and education.      More than 1,000 \\"honor killings\\" were carried out in Pakistan last year, a practice where women are murdered by their own relatives if they are seen as bringing \\"dishonor\\" on their families.      The CII's proposal was in response to an unconventionally liberal move by Pakistan's Punjab province, which pushed for a progressive gender-equality law called the Protection of Women Against Violence Act. The act sought to give women more rights, including fitting violent husbands with electronic tracking bracelets.      Rejecting that bill as \\"un-Islamic,\\" the CII proposed its own document instead. The CII's draft bill has to be finalized by the council before it is sent to the provincial legislature for approval.      In addition to the beatings, it also seeks to ban women from several aspects of society.      Female co-eds? Nope, not after primary school. Women joining combat squads in the armed forces? That would be out too — a far more conservative approach than the country's air force, which has started training women to be fighter pilots.      Women also would be barred for nursing male patients in hospital unless it is their husband, son, brother or father.      Related: Sister Says Husband Stoned Wife in 'Honor Killing'      The proposal does make some paltry concessions for the female population. It says they should be allowed to inherit property and given protection from being kicked out of their houses if their husband dies without a will. Women should not be subjected to forced marriage, acid attacks or honor killings, the draft also states.      Still, the list of punishable offenses goes on. The draft said beatings also should be administered to any woman who does not wear a hijab, gives money to other people without her husband’s permission, and talks loudly so the neighbors can hear.      Women would also be forced to breastfeed their kids for two years and banned from using contraception without their husband’s permission.      \\"Disgusting,\\" human-rights lawyer Asma Jahangir said in an interview with Pakistani television this week. \\"But we shouldn't be worried. The women of Pakistan know how to protect themselves.\\" ||||| The Council of Islamic Ideology advises Pakistan’s government and lawmakers on Islamic issues. Its proposals are recommendations, and not legally enforced.      The council drafted the controversial proposal in response to The Women's Protection Act, enacted in the province of Punjab in February, which is intended to improve legal protection to women from domestic, psychological and sexual violence.      The CII criticised the Women’s Protection Act as being “un-Islamic”. Its alternative draft proposal, while suggesting some women’s rights be enshrined in law, also says: \\"A husband should be allowed to lightly beat his wife if she defies his commands and refuses to dress up as per his desires; turns down demand for intercourse without any religious excuse; or does not take bath after intercourse or menstrual periods.\\"      The proposal also suggests interacting with strangers not wearing a hijab and speaking too loudly among other potential activities that might incur a light beating, the Express Tribune reports.      • #GirlsAtDhabas: Pakistani women take selfies in 'male' spaces to promote gender equality ||||| Summary:","output":"The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), a powerful constitutional body in Pakistan, has proposed legislation that would allow husbands to \\"lightly beat\\" their wives who decline sex or refuse to wear what their husbands want.

It is a federal constitutional republic, meaning that it has a political system in which power is divided between a central government and individual states, and its government is based on a constitution that outlines the structure, powers, and limitations of the government. Mexico is the third largest country in the Americas, spanning over 1.9 million square kilometers (761,610 square miles), and is the 11th most populous country in the world with over 126 million people. Its geography is diverse, featuring deserts, mountains, plateaus, and coastal plains. This allows Mexico to be home to a wide variety of flora and fauna species, many of which are endemic to the country. Mexico is bordered by the United States to the north, Belize and Guatemala to the south, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to the east. Due to its strategic location, Mexico serves as a bridge between the two American continents, both geographically and culturally. Mexican culture is known for its rich history, as several ancient civilizations like the Maya, Aztec, and Olmec once inhabited the region. This resulted in a unique blend of indigenous and Spanish (European) traditions, contributing to its famous art, music, and cuisine. Following its independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico has had a tumultuous political history, but it has experienced significant growth and modernization in recent decades.

For this reason , it was of key strategic importance .  - Ireland has historically been divided into four provinces: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Irish word for this territorial division, \\"cúige\\", literally meaning \\"fifth part\\", indicates that there were once five; the fifth province, Meath, was incorporated into Leinster, with parts going to Ulster. The provinces of Ireland serve no administrative or political purposes, but function as historical and cultural entities.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - In the Low Countries, stadtholder, literally steward, designated a medieval official and then a national leader.  - A Williamite is a follower of King William III of England who deposed King James II in the Glorious Revolution. William, the Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, replaced James with the support of English Whigs.   - Connacht or Connaught (or \\"Cúige Chonnacht\\") is one of the provinces of Ireland, situated in the west of the country. Up to the 9th century it consisted of several independent major kingdoms (Lúighne, Uí Maine, and Iarthar Connacht).     What is the relationship between 'siege of athlone' and 'conflict'? Answer:","output":"The Siege of Athlone was a part of the conflict known as the Williamite War in Ireland. The town of Athlone was strategically important and was besieged twice during this war. It was this conflict between the Jacobites and Williamites over the monarchy of England, Scotland and Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence 1: Generators respond by gradually reducing their emissions - reducing more than the cap requires early in the program in order to save allowances for use later in the program when the caps decline. Sentence 2: When the caps decline, the generators increase their emissions. Possible answers:  -yes.  -it is not possible to tell.  -no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, it appears to contradict the information provided in the first sentence. The first sentence explains that generators reduce their emissions gradually, particularly during the early stages of the program. They do this to save allowances for later when the caps on emissions become more restrictive. This suggests that generators take a proactive approach in controlling and conserving their emissions as the caps get lower over time. On the other hand, the second sentence states that when the caps decline, the generators increase their emissions. This statement is not consistent with the information in the first sentence. Instead, the first sentence implies that the generators would continue reducing, or at least maintaining, their emissions when faced with lower caps in order to stay within the allowable limits and make use of the saved allowances. Therefore, the second sentence is not supported by the information in the first sentence, and claiming that it is entailed by the first sentence would be incorrect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The engagement on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942, in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated, is known as the Dieppe Raid. Also referred to as Operation Jubilee, this battle was an Allied amphibious attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The purpose of the raid was to gain intelligence, boost morale, and test the feasibility of larger amphibious invasions in Europe. The operation involved more than 6,000 troops, primarily from the British, Canadian, and American forces, supported by naval and air forces. The HMS \\"Calpe\\" (L71), a British Hunt-class destroyer, played a crucial role in the Dieppe Raid by providing covering fire and escort to the landing crafts, as well as helping to evacuate Allied troops during the withdrawal phase. Unfortunately, the raid resulted in heavy losses and is considered a major setback in the Allied campaign, with over 3,600 troops killed, wounded, or captured.

How can I improve my decision making skills? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is centered around improving one's decision-making skills. I will provide a detailed and long answer that addresses this topic. Improving your decision-making skills is essential for personal and professional growth. Here are several strategies that can help you enhance your ability to make better decisions: 1. Analyze past decisions: Reflect on your past decisions, both good and bad, to understand where you went wrong or right. This will help you identify patterns in your decision-making process and learn from your mistakes. 2. Gain self-awareness: Understand your strengths and weaknesses, as well as your personal values and biases, to ensure that your decisions are grounded in objective analysis rather than influenced by emotions or preconceived notions. 3. Collect information: Before making a decision, collect as much relevant information as possible. This can include research, talking to experts, seeking advice from friends or colleagues, or even conducting surveys. Proper information gathering will help you make informed decisions based on facts, rather than assumptions. 4. Develop critical thinking skills: Critical thinking involves the ability to analyze information and situations objectively and draw logical conclusions. This skill is vital for decision-making, as it allows you to weigh the pros and cons of each option, identify potential risks and benefits, and ultimately make a well-informed choice. 5. Set clear objectives and priorities: Define your goals before making a decision, so you have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. This will help you stay focused and ensure your decisions align with your overall objectives. 6. Weigh alternatives: Consider multiple options and explore their potential consequences before committing to a decision. Weighing the pros and cons and evaluating different scenarios will help you make a balanced decision that meets both your short-term and long-term goals. 7. Practice active listening: When seeking advice or gathering information, listen carefully to what others have to say. This will help you become more open-minded and receptive to different perspectives, which can, in turn, lead to better decisions. 8. Take your time: Avoid rushing into decisions, as this can lead to unnecessary mistakes. Give yourself the time to gather information, weigh your options, and thoughtfully consider the potential consequences of your decision. 9. Embrace uncertainty: Recognize that making decisions involves a certain degree of risk and uncertainty. Learn to tolerate this uncertainty and use it as a catalyst for flexible thinking and adaptability, rather than allowing it to paralyze your decision-making process. 10. Learn from experience: Regularly evaluate the outcomes of your decisions to understand what works and what doesn't. Use this feedback to refine your decision-making skills and learn from both your successes and failures. 11. Develop self-confidence: Trust in your ability to make sound decisions and be willing to accept responsibility for them. This confidence will grow as you gain experience in decision-making and learn to navigate challenges. 12. Seek feedback and mentoring: Reach out to others who have experience in your field or expertise in decision-making, and seek their advice. This feedback can help you refine your process and develop new skills. In summary, improving your decision-making skills requires self-reflection, critical thinking, information gathering, patience, and a willingness to learn from your experiences. By practicing these strategies consistently, you will become more adept at making informed choices, ultimately leading to better outcomes in your personal and professional life."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos.

How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals   which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains   and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \\"sunrooms\\" with artificial   lights have been built. People can go there and get \\"sunlight\\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains. Through these ways, the weather can influence our emotions. Sadly, while the weather can change us, we can hardly change the weather. What may be the best title for this passage?

Article: People often talk as if shyness is a disease or mental condition that can be cured. I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul.

Options: A: proud all the time B: close to Jane Fonda C: impolite when young D: shy in her early years Answer:","output":"D: shy in her early years"},{"instruction":"Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

A passenger plane carrying 189 people crashed into the sea off Jakarta on Monday minutes after taking off on a domestic flight to an Indonesian tin-mining region.      Lion Air flight JT610, travelling from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka, lost contact with air traffic control about 13 minutes after it took off, shortly after its pilot had asked to return to base. Flight data showed that it made a sudden, sharp dive into the sea.      Officials said human remains had been recovered from the crash site, about nine miles (15km) off the coast, and that they did not expect to find survivors.      The plane was a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet, a new model that was launched globally only last year. The specific plane had been in use for less than three months.      Lion Air’s chief executive, Edward Sirait, told reporters the plane had suffered “a technical issue” on Sunday night but engineers had cleared it to fly on Monday morning. “This plane previously flew from Denpasar to Jakarta,” he said. “There was a report of a technical issue, which had been resolved according to procedure.”      Sirait did not elaborate on the specific issue, and said he had no plans to ground the rest of Lion Air’s Max 8 fleet.

Lion Air crash: officials say 188 onboard lost flight JT610 – latest updates Read more      On Monday rescuers released footage of debris and personal items floating in the water at the crash site, including handbags, clothing, mobile phones, ID cards and driving licences. Dozens of divers from the national search and rescue agency and the military were working to retrieve the bodies of victims.      At Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, relatives arrived at the airport crisis centre, many too distressed to talk to the media.      Tugi, a Jakarta resident, came to inquire about his friend Wendy. “I came to try and get some information, but they can’t give us any answers,” he said. “They don’t know yet, so I am going home and will monitor the media reports from there.”      Forensics officers have told family members of those on board that they can assist with the identification process by providing medical and dental records at the police hospital in East Jakarta.      About 20 of the 189 people on board were Indonesian finance department officials who had travelled to Jakarta for a conference. Three children, two of them infants, and eight crewmembers were also among those on board.      A statement from Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said the aircraft’s emergency locator transmitter had not sent out a distress signal despite being certified to work until August 2019.      The plane went down in waters about 30-35 metres (98-115ft) deep. Indonesia’s disaster agency spokesman posted video of debris on Twitter.

But it was confirmed that the pilot had requested to turn back shortly after takeoff.      “We will collect all data from the control tower,” said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the official. “The plane is so modern, it transmits data from the plane and that we will review too. But the most important is the black box.”      On Monday afternoon the national search and rescue agency said it had determined the location of the black box, but had not yet managed to retrieve it.      Profile Boeing 737 Max 8 Show Hide The Lion Air plane that crashed into the sea moments after takeoff on Monday had been used by the airline for only two months. It has been described as the “world’s most reliable airplane”. The 737 MAX 8 model was first operated for a commercial flight in May 2017 by Malindo Air, but has since been adopted by airlines globally. The plane is a variant of the Boeing 737 Max series, which is the fastest selling plane in Boeing history. Worth upwards of £70m, the Max 8 version has an air range of 6,570km and a passenger capacity of up to 210. The planes are built at Boeing’s factory in Renton, Washington, in the US. The plane has been purchased by airlines across the world, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Ryanair, Jet Airlines, FlyDubai, Norwegian Air, Iceland Air, SilkAir, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, Air Canada and Malaysia Airlines. In 2012, Lion Air was one of the first airlines to finalise an order – worth 22.4bn – with Boeing for the 737 Max. As of April this year, eight of the 201 planes ordered had been delivered to Lion Air. According to company reports, as of September 2018 the Boeing 737 Max had received 4,783 firm orders from more than 100 countries. Boeing says carbon emissions and cabin noise are down 20% and 40% respectively on previous models. The crash in Indonesia was the first incident involving the 737 Max model. In a statement released after the Indonesia crash, Boeing said the company “stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation\\".      The incident is the first to be reported that involves the widely sold Max 8, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the common 737. The first Boeing 737 Max jets were introduced into service in 2017.      Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board both said on Monday that they were providing assistance to Indonesian accident investigators.      The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, expressed his condolences in a televised address.      Australian government officials have been instructed not to fly with Lion Air until the cause of the crash can be determined.      Indonesia is one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, although its safety record is patchy. The crash could potentially be the country’s second worst air disaster since 1997, industry experts said.

Lion Air said in a statement that the pilot and co-pilot had more than 11,000 flight hours between them.      Three of the crew on board were trainee flight attendants and one was a technician.      Twenty employees from Indonesia's finance ministry were also on board, the BBC has learned.      A ministry spokesperson said they worked at the finance ministry offices in Pangkal Pinang but had been in Jakarta for the weekend.      What do we know about this aircraft?      The 737 Max series are the fastest-selling planes in Boeing history, and there are four models - the Max 7, Max 8, Max 9 and Max 10.      The Boeing 737 Max 8 has been in commercial use since 2016.      The aircraft involved in the crash was made in 2018. It is a single aisle plane used for short-haul travel.      In a statement, Boeing expressed sympathy for the victims and families and said it \\"stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation\\".      Australia told government workers and contractors to stop using the airline until the findings of the investigation were out.      How is Indonesia's air safety record?

(Associated Press)      KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) — A Lion Air plane carrying 189 people crashed into the sea just minutes after taking off from Indonesia's capital on Monday in a blow to the country's aviation safety record after the lifting of bans on its airlines by the European Union and U.S.      Indonesia's disaster agency posted photos online of a crushed smartphone, books, bags and parts of the aircraft fuselage that had been collected by search and rescue vessels.      Lion Air said the brand-new aircraft, on a 1-hour-and-10-minute flight to Pangkal Pinang on an island chain off Sumatra, was carrying 181 passengers, including one child and two babies, and eight crew members.      Indonesian TV broadcast pictures of a fuel slick and debris field. Distraught friends and relatives prayed and hugged each other as they waited at Pangkal Pinang's airport.      The National Search and Rescue Agency's deputy chief, Nugroho Budi Wiryanto, said some 300 people including soldiers, police and local fishermen are involved in the search and that so far it has recovered no bodies — only ID cards, personal belongings and aircraft debris.      \\"We are waiting for the miracle from God,\\" said Wiryanto, when asked if there's any hope of survivors.      At the agency's headquarters in Jakarta, family members turned up, hoping desperately for news.      Feni, who uses a single name, said her soon to be married sister was on the flight, planning to meet relatives in Pangkal Pinang.      \\"We are here to find any information about my younger sister, her fiance, her in-law to be and a friend of them,\\" said Feni.      \\"We don't have any information,\\" she said, as her father wiped tears from reddened eyes. \\"No one provided us with any information that we need. \\"We're confused. We hope that our family is still alive,\\" she said.      Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani also arrived at the agency and met with its chief, seeking information about 20 finance ministry staff who were on the flight after attending a ministry event in Jakarta.      The search and rescue agency said the flight ended in waters off West Java that are 30 to 35 meters (98 to 115 feet) deep.      The agency's chief Muhammad Syaugi told a news conference that divers are trying to locate the wreckage.      Weather conditions for the flight were safe, according to the Indonesian meteorology agency. It said the type of clouds associated with turbulence was not present and winds were weak.      The Boeing 737 Max 8 was delivered to Lion Air in mid-August and put in use within days, according to aviation website Flightradar24. Malindo Air, a Malaysian subsidiary of Jakarta-based Lion Air, was the first airline to being using the 737 Max 8 last year. The Max 8 replaced the similar 800 in the Chicago-based planemaker's product line.      Lion Air's president-director Edward Sirait said the plane had a \\"technical problem\\" on its previous flight from Bali to Jakarta but it had been fully remedied. He didn't know specifics of the problem when asked in a TV interview. The pilot of Flight 610 had more than 6,000 flying hours while the co-pilot had more than 5,000 hours, according to the airline.      Boeing Co. said it was \\"deeply saddened\\" by the crash and was prepared to provide technical assistance into the crash probe, which will be carried out by Indonesian investigators.      In its statement, the Chicago-based manufacturer expressed its concern for the 189 people onboard, and offered \\"heartfelt sympathies to their families and loved ones.\\"      Indonesia's Transport Ministry said the plane took off from Jakarta about 6.20 a.m. and crashed just 13 minutes later. Data from FlightAware showed it had reached an altitude of only 5,200 feet (1,580 meters).      The transport ministry said crisis centers have been set up Pangkal Pinang's airport and Jakarta's Soekarno Hatta airport.      The crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea in December 2014, killing all 162 on board.      Indonesian airlines were barred in 2007 were flying to Europe because of safety concerns, though several were allowed to resume services in the following decade. The ban was completely lifted in June this year. The U.S. lifted a decadelong ban in 2016.      Lion Air, a discount carrier, is one of Indonesia's youngest and biggest airlines, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.      In 2013, one of its Boeing 737-800 jets missed the runway while landing on the resort island of Bali, crashing into the sea without causing any fatalities among the 108 people on board.      __      Wright reported from Jakarta.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.  Question: \\"When you breathe in, what happens to the size of your chest?\\" Answer: \\"Increases in size\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. As explained in the text, when the diaphragm muscle tightens during inhalation, it increases the size of the chest. This decrease in air pressure within the chest and lungs allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Thus, when you breathe in, your chest increases in size."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unsaturated hydrocarbons are broken down into two types: Alkenes and Alkynes.  1. Alkenes: These are hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon-to-carbon double bond (C=C). The simplest alkene, ethene (also known as ethylene), has two carbon atoms and a double bond between them. This category of unsaturated hydrocarbons is characterized by the general formula CnH2n. 2. Alkynes: These are hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-to-carbon triple bond (C≡C). The simplest alkyne, ethyne (also known as acetylene), has two carbon atoms and a triple bond between them.

'I paid £5,190 for a car on eBay - where is it?' In the last of the 12 emails that went between us, the “seller” thanked me for a “pleasant transaction”. He said the search engine had confirmed that the money was in a holding account and he would now send the car. After that his mobile shut off and the car has not been delivered. I am an avid user of eBay and have never encountered any problems until now. I am 57, trustworthy and honest. This has affected my health and I now trust no one. I have been reporting on this style of scam for a long while with similar scenarios to yours, applying also to horseboxes and camper vans. Sadly the admirable qualities you mention do not equip one to deal with the internet jungle of chancers. Before the car was due to be delivered, you woke at night to check with the search engine the payment plan was supposed to be with. Only then did you discover the payment method doesn’t exist. Your bank said it could not help as you had sent the money willingly. You contacted Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre on 0300 123 2040. • 'eBay sided with buyer over dispute, despite agreeing that I was right' • 'Cheque scam cost my B&B £1,400' By now eBay and Barclays – the bank the payment had actually gone to – recognising something was wrong, had closed the listing and the account respectively. “Fraudsters use very sophisticated methods to try and imitate trusted websites, but transactions completed outside eBay’s platform aren’t eBay transactions,” an eBay spokesman said. “This includes purchases completed following emailed instructions to transfer money to a bank account.” It is worth noting that in any case eBay does not give protection for vehicle sales. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas A Barclays spokesman said: “Appropriate documentation was presented on the account in question and there was no indication it would be used for fraudulent purposes. As soon as we were alerted to the inappropriate activity we acted swiftly to investigate and close the account. “Regrettably by the time we were made aware of the fraud only £77 remained in the account, which we have returned to the customer.” It seems the money may have been used to buy genuine goods and services so I asked why that avenue of inquiry had apparently not been pursued. Barclays said the police had more powers to pursue such enquiries, although it said it was prepared to work closely with them.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\". Soon, Donald returns to his old self and forgets about his singing career and Daisy regains her lover.","output":"The psychologist gives a dilemma to Daisy, who must choose between having Donald's improved singing voice and successful career but losing him as her lover, or regaining Donald as her lover but losing his singing career and improved voice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population. In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. \\"But they may not yet be eligible   for listing as a threatened species,\\" said Senator Doug Cameron. \\"To have such a significant Australian icon  included on the threatened species list would be a national shame.\\" The koala is found only in the eucalyptus   forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads. Putting off the decision on protection for the koala \\"is really bad news,\\" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. \\"We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,\\" Pointing said. \\"That data should be enough to make a decision.\\" However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least 6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way.

Answer based on context: Coming off their win over the Cardinals, the Broncos flew to East Rutherford, New Jersey, for an AFC match against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. A 37-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus gave the Broncos the lead on the game's opening possession. The Jets grabbed the lead on their second possession, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Geno Smith to tight end Jace Amaro. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next four offensive possessions, but re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes &#8212; a 1-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, followed by a 22-yarder to tight end Julius Thomas just before halftime. The Broncos added to their lead on their first possession of the third quarter, with Manning connecting on another touchdown pass to Julius Thomas &#8212; from 4 yards out. However, the Jets later cut into the Broncos' lead, with a 30-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Folk, followed in the fourth quarter by a 2-yard touchdown pass from Smith to wide receiver Eric Decker, to narrow the Broncos' lead to 24-17 with eight minutes remaining in the game. Both teams went three-and-out on their next offensive possessions. The Broncos' offense got the football with 5:05 remaining in the game, and forced the Jets to burn all of their team timeouts just after the two-minute warning, but failed to convert on a critical third-down pass with 1:07 remaining in the game, forcing a punt. The Jets had one last possession deep in their own territory, however, on the third play, Smith was intercepted by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib, who ran 22 yards into the end zone for the game-clinching touchdown. How many is the difference in the number of yards of the field goal Prater made and the number of yards of the TD pass Julius Thomas caught?","output":"Based on the given context, placekicker Brandon McManus made a 37-yard field goal, and quarterback Peyton Manning had thrown a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas.  To find the difference in the number of yards between the field goal and the touchdown pass, you simply subtract the smaller number (the touchdown pass yards) from the larger number (the field goal yards): 37 (field goal yards) - 22 (touchdown pass yards) = 15 So, the difference in the number of yards between the field goal and the touchdown pass is 15 yards."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The oval symbol indicates approximately the location of the velodrome Add punctuation.","output":"\\"The oval symbol indicates approximately the location of the velodrome.\\" This statement implies that a certain visual marking, in this case, an oval, is used to denote roughly the position of a velodrome. A velodrome, which is an arena for track cycling, is thereby identified on a specific map or chart with an estimated degree of precision rather than total accuracy. Often, such notational simplicity is employed in diagrams or maps to facilitate understanding, as precise scaling might complicate the representation.  This generalization is primarily adapted to enable viewers or readers to identify at a glimpse where a velodrome is. It helps orient the observer about the velodrome's location within the larger layout, even if it doesn't provide a pinpoint accurate position. This method contributes much to the schematic layout's user-friendliness referenced by a visual guide with labels, symbols, and even color codes. Oval symbols are utilized in significant respect because they closely resemble the shape of a standard velodrome. A velodrome, viewed from above, forms a loop almost oval in shape, thereby making an oval symbol an intuitive design choice to signify a velodrome within diagrams or maps. Yet, it’s wise to note that not every oval symbol in every diagram will represent a velodrome since the key or legend of the map or diagram has the ultimate decision on the representations. Given the context given, the observer should be able to recognize the oval symbol in the diagram or map, know it represents the approximate location of the velodrome, and use this information to his benefit. It’s foreseeable that this information might be beneficial in numerous ways, such as planning travel routes, understanding the layout of a local area, or even creating a mental image of a location with which the observer might not be familiar. The use of such simplified symbols is an efficient tool for conveying complex spatial information in an easy-to-understand format."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Hughes  for the following movie plot:  In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a rocket pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1] At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out. She is later detained and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life.

Both sentences convey the same information but with slightly different structures and wordings. They both mention Milton J. Kramer as the architect and Herbert J. Krapp as the original owner. The key difference lies in how the sentences are constructed. In the first sentence, \\"Milton J. Kramer was the architect, and Herbert J. Krapp was the original owner,\\" the sentence is separated with a comma and the conjunction \\"and.\\" This construction clearly defines the two distinct pieces of information—Milton J. Kramer being the architect and Herbert J. Krapp being the original owner. The information is neatly divided into two clauses that highlight each subject (Milton J. Kramer and Herbert J. Krapp) and their respective roles (architect and original owner). In the second sentence, \\"The architect was Milton J. Kramer, and Herbert J. Krapp was the original owners,\\" the structure is slightly different. The sentence starts with the role \\"The architect\\" and follows with the individual \\"Milton J. Kramer.\\" Then, using similar construction to the first sentence, a comma and \\"and\\" are used to introduce the second piece of information—Herbert J. Krapp as the original owner. However, there is a minor grammatical error in this sentence: the phrase \\"the original owners\\" should be \\"the original owner\\" to maintain consistency with the first sentence and to correctly align with the singular subject \\"Herbert J. Krapp.\\" In summary, although both sentences present the same information, they employ different structures and arrangements of words to express that information. This variation in sentence construction is what makes these sentences paraphrases of one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information:  - The cocoa bean, also cacao bean or simply cocoa or cacao, is the dried and fully fermented fatty seed of \\"Theobroma cacao\\", from which cocoa solids and cocoa butter can be extracted. The \\"beans\\" are the basis of chocolate, as well as Mesoamerican foods, such as \\"mole\\" and \\"tejate\\".  - Palm oil (also known as dendê oil, from Portuguese) is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms, primarily the African oil palm \\"Elaeis guineensis\\", and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm \\"Elaeis oleifera\\" and the maripa palm \\"Attalea maripa\\".  - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" .  - Flavor (or flavour; see spelling differences) is the sensory impression of food or other substance, and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell. The \\"trigeminal senses\\", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall Gestalt of flavor perception. The flavor of the food, as such, can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses.  - Rancidification, the product of which can be described as rancidity, is the process which causes a substance to become rancid, that is, having a rank, unpleasant smell or taste. Specifically, it is the hydrolysis and/or autoxidation of fats into short-chain aldehydes and ketones which are objectionable in taste and odor. When these processes occur in food, undesirable odors and flavors can result. In some cases, however, the flavors can be desirable (as in aged cheeses). In processed meats, these flavors are collectively known as warmed-over flavor. Rancidification can also detract from the nutritional value of food, and some vitamins are highly sensitive to degradation. Akin to rancidification, oxidative degradation also occurs in other hydrocarbons, e.g. lubricating oils, fuels, and mechanical cutting fluids.  - The palm kernel is the edible seed of the oil palm fruit. The fruit yields two distinct oils: palm oil derived from the outer parts of the fruit, and palm kernel oil derived from the kernel.  - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.  - A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acids all have single bonds.  - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words  (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and  (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\". It translates to \\"food of the gods.\\"  - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru.  - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate.  - Copra is the dried meat, or dried kernel, of the coconut used to extract coconut oil. The earliest evidence of the extracting and use of coconut oil from copra is in early Tamil literature from the 1st century AD. The word originated from the Malayalam word \\"koppra\\". Coconut oil is extracted from it and this has made copra an important agricultural commodity for many coconut-producing countries. It also yields coconut cake, which is mainly used as feed for livestock.  - Palm kernel oil is an edible plant oil derived from the kernel of the oil palm \\"Elaeis guineensis\\". It should not be confused with the other two edible oils derived from palm fruits: palm oil, extracted from the pulp of the oil palm fruit, and coconut oil, extracted from the kernel of the coconut.  - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.  - The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a solid is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure. When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of some substances to supercool, the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance. When the \\"characteristic freezing point\\" of a substance is determined, in fact the actual methodology is almost always \\"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice\\", that is, the melting point.  - Coconut oil, or copra oil, is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts harvested from the coconut palm (\\"Cocos nucifera\\"). It has various applications. Because of its high saturated fat content, it is slow to oxidize and, thus, resistant to rancidification, lasting up to six months at without spoiling.  - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City.  - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.  - Compound chocolate is a product made from a combination of cocoa , vegetable fat , and sweeteners . It is used as a lower - cost alternative to true chocolate , as it uses less - expensive hard vegetable fats such as coconut oil or palm kernel oil in place of the more expensive cocoa butter . It may also be known as ' compound coating ' or ' chocolatey coating ' when used as a coating for candy . Often used in lower - grade candy bars , compound chocolate is designed to simulate enrobed chocolate on a product . Cocoa butter must be tempered to maintain gloss and coating . A baker tempers chocolate by cooling the chocolate mass below its setting point , then rewarming the chocolate to between 31 and 32 ° C ( 88 and 90 ° F ) for milk chocolate , or between 32 and 33 ° C ( 90 and 91 ° F ) for semi-sweet chocolate . Compound coatings , however , do not need to be tempered . Instead , they are simply warmed to between 3 and 5 ° C ( 5.4 and 9.0 ° F ) above the coating 's melting point .  - Cocoa butter, also called theobroma oil, is a pale-yellow, edible vegetable fat extracted from the cocoa bean. It is used to make chocolate, as well as some ointments, toiletries, and pharmaceuticals. Cocoa butter has a cocoa flavor and aroma. Its best-known attribute is its melting point, which is just below human body temperature.    What is the relationship between 'compound chocolate' and 'cocoa solids'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'compound chocolate' and 'cocoa solids' is that compound chocolate is a lower-cost alternative to true chocolate, using less-expensive vegetable fats such as coconut oil or palm kernel oil in place of the more expensive cocoa butter, which is found in cocoa solids. Cocoa solids are derived from cocoa beans and are the primary component in the production of true chocolate. Compound chocolate, on the other hand, contains less cocoa solids and replaces cocoa butter with vegetable fats to achieve a similar taste and texture at a lower cost."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Billy Bob sat on a bar stool and ordered a steak.

Instead of adopting a federal model, the UK has relied on gradual devolution to decentralise political power. Devolution in the UK began with the Government of Ireland Act 1914 which granted home rule to Ireland as a constituent country of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign Irish Free State (which eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by direct rule during the period of conflict known as The Troubles. What is Ireland Act 1914?","output":"The Ireland Act 1914, also known as the Government of Ireland Act 1914, was a law passed by the United Kingdom Parliament. This law was created to give Ireland, which was a part of the UK at the time, more control over their own affairs, like making decisions and rules just for their country instead of having all decisions made in London. This is called \\"home rule.\\" The Act was important because it was the first step in Ireland getting more freedom and eventually becoming their own separate country, known today as the Republic of Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: The Magic of Making Eye Contact: Helping You Connect with Others Hey kids, do you know that our eyes can do more than just see things? That's right! Our eyes can help us connect with other people by showing them that we're listening and that we care about what they're saying. This is called \\"making eye contact,\\" and it's a really important skill to learn. Making eye contact means looking into the eyes of the person you're talking to. By doing this, we can show them that we're paying attention, and that we want to understand what they're saying. This is especially important when you're trying to make a new friend, talking to a grown-up, or even going on a date someday. So, how do we practice good listening skills by making eye contact? Here are some fun tips to help you be a great listener: 1. Find a happy medium: Try not to stare at people too much, because that can make them uncomfortable. Instead, find a \\"happy medium\\" – a comfortable amount of time to look into someone's eyes and then look away for a moment. It's like taking turns with your eyes, so both you and the other person feel comfortable. 2. Show eye magnetism: You know how magnets can attract each other? You can do that with your eyes too! By showing curiosity and interest in the person you're talking to, your eyes can help you form a strong connection with them. Just think about something you're really excited about – like your favorite toy or game – and make your eyes light up with that same excitement when you're talking to someone new. 3. Smile with your eyes: When you're happy, your eyes can show it too. Practice smiling with your eyes by thinking about something that makes you feel good – like the best day you've ever had. Your eyes will naturally sparkle and make the other person feel good too. 4. Always make eye contact in job interviews: Job interviews might be a grown-up thing, but you can still practice making eye contact with family members and friends. By doing this, you'll be ready when it's time for you to interview for a super cool job someday. 5. Make eye contact on dates: When you're older, you might go on dates with people you like. Making eye contact can help you show them that you're interested and that you're a great listener. Plus, it's a great way to make a strong connection with them, just like with new friends or job interviews. 6. Make eye contact when you want to prove a point: Sometimes, we need to convince someone of something – like that we're really good at a game or that we know the answer to a tricky question. By making eye contact, you can show them that you're confident and that they should listen to your idea. Now that you know how magical making eye contact can be, practice it with everyone you talk to – your family, your friends, and even your teachers. The more you practice, the better listener you'll become, and the more people will enjoy talking to you. So go on, kids, and show the world the magic of your eyes!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The Roman Republic (Latin: Res publica Romana; Classical Latin: [ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na]) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic. What marked the beginning of the Roman Republic?","output":"The beginning of the Roman Republic was marked by the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, which is traditionally dated to 509 BC. This is when Rome's control started to expand from the city's immediate surroundings to eventually cover the entire Mediterranean world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? That Jack ever slept is impossible.","output":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence, \\"That Jack ever slept is impossible,\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. While it may sound a bit odd or unusual to some speakers, we can break down the sentence in terms of its components and structure to understand how it is grammatically correct. 1. Sentence structure: The sentence is a complex sentence, meaning it is composed of an independent clause (\\"is impossible\\") and a dependent clause (\\"That Jack ever slept\\"). The dependent clause functions as the subject of the independent clause. The sentence then contains a subject, a verb, and a complement, which are the essential components of a complete sentence. 2. Embedded clause: \\"That Jack ever slept\\" is an embedded clause that serves as the subject of the sentence. The word \\"that\\" functions as a subordinator, introducing the embedded clause. The embedded clause in this case expresses a likely content or the idea that is said to be impossible. 3. \\"Ever\\": Using \\"ever\\" in the sentence adds a sense of emphasis, making it clear that there is no point in time when the speaker thinks Jack slept. The word \\"ever\\" functions as an adverb in the sentence. It is grammatically acceptable to use adverbs like \\"ever,\\" \\"sometimes,\\" or \\"often\\" to modify the verb \\"slept,\\" as they provide additional information about when or how often the action took place. 4. Lexical and tense agreement: All words in the sentence agree with each other in terms of tense and category. The main verb \\"is\\" is in the present tense, and \\"slept\\" is in the past tense, which is appropriate in this context because the speaker is making a statement about a past event (Jack sleeping) that is believed to be impossible. The noun Jack and the verb “slept” also correspond to their appropriate syntactic roles (subject and verb in embedded clause) in a similar fashion. While the sentence structure might feel somewhat uncommon to everyday language, it is important to remember that linguists often deal with a wide range of sentences, including those that may be less frequently used in casual speech. In conclusion, a linguist would find the sentence \\"That Jack ever slept is impossible\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically, even though it might not be considered idiomatic or common in everyday conversation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning.  Question: suppose there are less clouds that build up happens, how will it affect there are more thunderclouds.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If there are fewer clouds in which ice formation and electrostatic charge buildup can occur, it will likely have a negative impact on the formation of thunderclouds. This is because the essential processes for a cloud to become a thundercloud will have fewer opportunities to initiate and develop.

Q:Information:  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.  - In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a mathematical object representing a collection of questions that computers might be able to solve. For example, the problem of factoring  - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time .  - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\"  - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Authorities in Uganda were investigating the death of a U.S. reality television producer whose work included \\"The Amazing Race\\" and \\"Whale Wars,'\\" officials said Wednesday. Andrew Kaweesi, commander of the Kampala Metropolitan Police Force, said that, based on preliminary toxicology results, officials believe Jeff Rice died of a drug overdose. Kaweesi said he did not know what drug may have been involved. An official police statement will be issued Thursday, according to Kaweesi. Rice's body was found late last week in a hotel room, according to reports. Sally Blackman, Rice's wife and business partner, announced his death Sunday. Bronstein said Rice wrote her e-mails last week from OPTIONS: - American indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Andrew Kaweesi indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - CNN indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Jeff Rice indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Kampala indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Kampala Metropolitan Police Force indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Kaweesi indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Rice indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Sally Blackman indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - The Amazing Race indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - U.S. indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Uganda indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. - Whale Wars indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March.","output":"The most logical completion of this news story would be: \\"Bronstein said Rice wrote her emails last week from Uganda indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March.\\"  This choice fills in the gap with a location ('Uganda') which fits logically in the sentence, and aligns with the rest of the dispatches' content. The late Jeff Rice was obviously in Uganda when the incident occurred, rendering it the most reasonable assumption that his emails were sent from there. Also, considering that he did not leave the country before his demise, noting that he initially planned to stay through mid-March provides additional relevant information. Other options like 'Sally Blackman,' 'The Amazing Race,' 'U.S.', 'Whale Wars', and 'Andrew Kaweesi' could be misleading, as they do not offer a location which is contextually appropriate in this instance.  Importantly too, using 'Rice' or 'Jeff Rice' would be syntactically odd, as Rice would not refer to himself in the third person in his own emails. Similarly, 'CNN', 'American', 'Kampala', 'Kaweesi', 'Kampala Metropolitan Police Force' would not make sense because these aren't locations from where Rice would be emailing about his stay in Uganda.  To conclude, given the data, we have at hand, 'Uganda' is the most plausible completion of the news story. However, the findings of the ongoing investigation and any future disclosures pertaining to Jeff Rice's case might alter this understanding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gravity pulls objects towards planets, and by the simplest definition, a planet is a large object that orbits a star. Given these facts, what pulls objects towards large objects that orbit stars among the following options: - planets  - wind  - sun's heat  - dust  - gravity  - asteroids  - speed  - forces The answer to this question is:","output":"Gravity.  Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward large objects that orbit stars, such as planets. It is a fundamental force that exists between any two masses in the universe. The larger the mass and the closer the distance between them, the stronger the gravitational force.  Planetary bodies such as the Earth, the Moon, and other planets have large enough masses to create a significant gravitational force. This force is responsible for the motion of celestial objects in orbit around one another and plays a crucial role in shaping our universe. While some of the other options mentioned may have an influence on how objects move in space, gravity is the primary force responsible for pulling objects towards planets and other massive celestial objects. Here's a brief explanation of each of the other options: 1. Planets: Planets are the objects that have a gravitational force, and it's due to their masses. They are not in themselves a force that pulls objects. 2. Wind: Wind is a stream of air on Earth and has no influence over objects in space since there is no atmosphere in the vacuum of space. 3. Sun's heat: The sun's heat can cause some effects on objects in space due to thermal radiation pressure. However, this pressure is minuscule in comparison to the gravitational force and doesn't play a significant role in drawing objects toward massive celestial bodies. 4. Dust: Dust in space can be influenced by gravity and other forces, but it cannot be considered as a primary force pulling objects towards planets. 5. Asteroids: Asteroids, like planets, can have a gravitational force, but only due to their mass. They are not a force themselves that pulls objects towards celestial bodies. 6. Speed: The speed of an object is not a force, but a measure of how an object is moving through space. Objects in orbits around planets are influenced by gravitational forces that govern their motion and speed. 7. Forces: There are various forces that govern motion and events in our universe, including gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. Among these, gravity has the most significant effect on drawing objects towards planets and massive celestial bodies. In conclusion, gravity is the force that pulls objects towards large objects that orbit stars. It is due to the masses of these celestial bodies and their proximity to one another that their gravitational attraction is felt. This universal force is responsible for shaping the physical behaviors and interactions within our cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: Which of the following was not characteristic of music of the Romantic era: an extended melodic line, emotional elements, or Classical era forms?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: how does agreement show grammatical relation I found the following answer on Google: For example, in Standard English , one may say I am or he is, but not \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\". Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, but it can be more detailed. Agreement indeed shows the grammatical relation between the varying elements in a sentence – specifically the subject, verb, and, at times, the object. Linguistically, the term \\"agreement\\" (also known as concord or subject-verb agreement) refers to the syntax rule requiring the harmonizing of elements within a sentence to display a sense of consistency or uniformity. Let's further break down the concept: 1. Subject-Verb Agreement: In English, the subject and the verb need to \\"agree\\" in number and person. This means that if the subject is singular, the verb form must also be singular, and if it is plural, the verb form should also be plural. Similarly, if the subject is in the first, second, or third person, the verb form should agree with its person. For example, considering the sentence \\"He is happy,\\" the subject \\"he\\" is in the third person singular. Consequently, the verb \\"is\\" must also be in the third person singular form to maintain grammatical agreement. Incorrect example: They works hard. (Incorrect agreement) Correct example: They work hard. (Correct agreement) 2. Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement: The same agreement rule applies to pronouns and their antecedents, where the pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number, person, and gender. For example, \\"Sophia finished her homework because she is diligent.\\" – In this sentence, the pronoun \\"her\\" and \\"she\\" correctly agree with their antecedent, \\"Sophia,\\" in both number and gender. Incorrect example: The students should complete their assignment because it is important. (Incorrect agreement with the antecedent) Correct example: The students should complete their assignment because they are important. (Correct agreement with the antecedent) 3. Noun-Adjective Agreement: Unlike English, some languages, such as Spanish, French and German, require agreement between nouns and adjectives in terms of number and gender. For example, in Spanish: \\"Los niños pequeños\\" (the small boys) – Here, \\"niños\\" (children) is a plural masculine noun, and the adjective \\"pequeños\\" (small) agrees in both number and gender. In conclusion, agreement is a fundamental part of the grammar within a language. It ensures that the different elements of a sentence maintain consistency, showcasing a harmonious relation between these elements and enhancing clarity, so the meaning is effectively conveyed to the reader or listener."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature...  Paragraph: Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person observed an increased glacier outflow?

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data presented here consists of three key pieces of information. They revolve around the discovery of the asteroid 1036 Ganymed, its discoverer Walter Baade, and some significant details about his life and education. Let's examine each piece of information in more detail. 1. 1036 Ganymed:    The asteroid 1036 Ganymed is a large Amor asteroid, which is a group of near-Earth asteroids. It was discovered in 1924 by the German astronomer Walter Baade. The asteroid is named after Ganymede, a character from Greek mythology who was known to be the most beautiful mortal and was abducted by Zeus in the form of a giant eagle to serve as a cupbearer to the gods. Ganymed is considered the largest of the near-Earth asteroids. Its diameter is approximately 32 kilometers, making it bigger than most other asteroids in its group. The orbit of 1036 Ganymed is highly eccentric, with the asteroid occasionally coming fairly close to Earth. 2. Walter Baade:    Walter Baade, born on March 24, 1893, was a famous German astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of astronomy and astrophysics. He was the discoverer of the asteroid 1036 Ganymed. His work in identifying and studying Ganymed led to a deeper understanding of asteroid compositions, orbits, and their categorization. Besides discovering Ganymed, Baade was also a pioneer in many areas of astronomy, including studying supernovae, galaxy classification, and variable stars. He collaborated with Fritz Zwicky to develop the concept of neutron stars and to theorize the existence of dark matter. 3. Death Place & Alma Mater:    Walter Baade passed away on June 25, 1960, in West Germany. At the time of his death, West Germany was a federal parliamentary republic that had been established in 1949 as a result of the division of Germany after World War II. West Germany remained in existence until German reunification in 1990. Throughout his life, Walter Baade was associated with many prestigious educational and research institutions, including the University of Göttingen. This university, situated in the Lower Saxony region of Germany, is one of the oldest and most renowned universities in the country. Established in 1734 by King George II of Great Britain, the University of Göttingen has produced numerous notable scholars in various fields of study. As Baade's alma mater, this institution played a significant role in shaping his expertise and academic foundations, upon which he built an impressive career as an astronomer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The UI feels outdated, and the overall design does not provide a smooth, user-friendly experience. Navigating between various sections of the app, such as my inbox, drafts, and sent emails, proved to be unnecessarily complex and time-consuming. 2. Unreliable App Performance: The app frequently freezes and crashes, especially upon waking it from sleep mode. As a result, I often lose my unsent emails, important notes, or important attachments, leading to frustration. 3. Inefficient Email Management: Although I appreciate its support for multiple email accounts, the app tends to mix all my inboxes together. Consequently, it has become tricky to manage my personal and work emails separately. The app also fails to synchronize my emails at times, pushing me to manually refresh my inbox to access the latest messages. 4. Sparse Customization Options: The com.fsck.k9 app offers limited customization options to update and modify settings according to my preferences. Although it does offer some essential features like signatures and label customization, options to change fonts, the color scheme, or layout are sorely lacking. 5.

This issue has resulted in missed deadlines and time lost searching for misplaced emails. In conclusion, despite its potential usefulness as an open-source email client, the com.fsck.k9 app has left me dissatisfied with its performance and overall user experience.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed.

Business success: Nicky Blair, the football agent son of Tony Blair, is understood to have secured a record fee for a Mexican star this summer. He has some way to go before  he matches his father’s multi- million-pound fortune. But Nicky Blair certainly seems to be heading in the right direction. After setting himself up as a football agent, Tony Blair’s middle son has reportedly struck his first big deal – collecting 10 per cent from a £6.7million transfer. Nicky, 27, apparently helped negotiate the big-money move of Mexican Hector Herrera to top European side FC Porto in June. But that record transfer for a Mexican player may be dwarfed if his compatriot Marco Fabian, who is also represented by Nicky, is snapped up by Premier League or European clubs next year for a reputed £10million. Nicky was once thought to want to follow his father into politics. But unlike older brother Euan, 29, who is tipped to stand for Parliament, Nicky left Oxford, where he studied modern history, and taught at an inner-city school in the West Midlands for two years. He and his university friend Gabriel Moraes then launched themselves into the lucrative field of football agencies. Last year he was sharing a desk in his mother Cherie’s London law practice but his Magnitude agency has reportedly become so successful that it now has offices in Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. Star player: FC Porto's £6.7million Mexican midfielder Hector Herrera runs with the ball last week, and moved to the European giant in a deal secured by young Blair. His success makes him a chip off the old block. Tony Blair makes millions of pounds a year advising governments and international firms, and is said to be worth £60million to £80million. He is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 hidden in a network of private firms. However he is believed to have paid for the a four-storey, £1.35million Georgian townhouse in central London where Nicky lives. Nicky's mother was a director of  Magnitude Limited until May, owning 20 per cent, and allows her son to use a desk at her business in central London. Supportive: Nicky, pictured left with his siblings Kathryn and Euan, has had help from his parents, including mother Cherie, who is a director of his company and on one occasion helped court a young star on his behalf. EUAN BLAIR: Euan is the eldest Blair child and is the only one with obvious political ambitions. The Labour seat of Coventry North West could become vacant as current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015, and the 29-year-old is thought to be keen. He is currently chief commercial officer for recruitment agency Sarina Russo Job Access. Last month he married his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire. KATHRYN BLAIR: 25-year-old Kathryn was called to the Bar last year by Lincoln’s Inn – the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s. The young barrister has a boyfriend and lives in £975,000 home her father bought her in 2010, near his own central London property. LEO BLAIR: 13-year-old Leo is the youngest child, and known to be musically-gifted, currently appearing in the English National Opera's production of The Magic Flute. The schoolboy is playing 'Spirit', and made his West End debut in the chorus of Bizet’s Carmen last year. In 2000 he was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister for 150 years, and was named after Tony Blair's late father. Mrs Blair had even taken major steps to help Nicky secure top players in the Americas. In 2011 she took time out of her busy international schedule to meet an unknown Mexican footballer. A car collected then 17-year-old soccer prodigy Raul Mendiola from his family’s rundown trailer-park home in a Spanish-speaking suburb of Los Angeles and took him to the plush hotel where the wife of the ex-Prime Minister was staying. She spent time chatting to the footballer before posing for a photograph with him. Just days later, in an apparent attempt to cement confidence in her son’s business, Raul’s mother Claudia Velador received a picture of a smartly dressed Mr and Mrs Blair, personally signed with the words ‘Thank you’. But it emerged that Raul had no idea he had entrusted his future to a man whose parents are on first-name terms with the world’s most powerful people. Speaking from her home in San Bernardino, California, Claudia said: ‘Raul didn’t have a clue he was dealing with a former Prime Minister’s son'. He now plays for David Beckham's former side LA Galaxy. Nicky gave up being a school teacher to set up the company with Oxford University friend Gabriel Moraes. However, it emerged earlier this year that the business was loss-making and was to be dissolved and restructured. But the Herrera transfer may have made. all the difference to the company and Nicky is now said to be looking. to expand into the Middle East.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Intellectual property (IP) is a product of the mind that has commercial value. The concept dates back to 1623, when the first patent law to protect IP rights was passed. IP rights protect an artist from having his/her creative ideas copied by another. For example, if somebody generated an idea for a novel, that idea is protected by IP rights. If someone else wishes to represent the idea or develop it further, he/she must consult the original artists, who will normally be rewarded financially for its use. Back in the 17thcentury, IP rights were primarily carried out to protect newly developed manufacturing processes against stealing, but today intellectual property rights are also enjoyed by those who create music, art and literature. In recent years, IP rights have been the focus of a great deal of discussion because of a technology which looks set to weaken them altogether: the Internet. Many years ago, if you wanted a recoding of a song, you would have to purchase it from a music store; if a novel, from a book store.

Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it?  Owen inherited two pieces of land. The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture.  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","output":"The Western land had fewer wetland plants growing on it. In the given paragraph, it explains that Owen inherited two pieces of land - the Eastern land and the Western land. The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, making it unsuitable for construction or agricultural purposes, as wetlands are characterized by hypoxic soils due to the rapid consumption of oxygen by soil microorganisms. In contrast, the Western land had rich soil suitable for agriculture, which indicates that it was not predominantly a wetland area. Furthermore, the paragraph also explains various adaptations of wetland plants, such as the presence of aerenchyma, to cope with the hypoxic soil conditions. The mention of these adaptations in the context of wetland plants suggests that the Eastern land, being a wetland area, had more of these wetland plants growing on it. Therefore, based on the information provided, the Western land had fewer wetland plants growing on it, as it was suitable for agricultural purposes and not characterized as a wetland area like the Eastern land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Research funded by the Public Policy Institute of California indicates that in 1996, 1,786 Silicon Valley technology companies with 12.5 billion in sales and 46,000 employees were run by Indian or Chinese executives. Moreover, the pace of entrepreneurship among local immigrants is increasing rapidly. While Chinese or Indian executives are at the helm of 13% of the Silicon Valley technology businesses started between 1980 and 1985, they are running 27% of the more than 4,000 businesses started between 1991 and 1996. Start-up firms remain a primary source for new ideas and innovation for Chinese American internet entrepreneurs. Many of them are employed or directly engaged in new start-up activities. The proportional share of start-up firms by ethnic Chinese in Silicon Valley skyrocketed from 9% in 1980-1984 to about 20% between 1995-1998. By 2006, Chinese American internet entrepreneurs continued to start 20% of all Silicon Valley start-up firms, leading 2000 Silicon Valley companies, and employing 58,000 workers. They still continue to own about 20% of all information technology companies that were founded in Silicon Valley since 1980. Answer this question: How many more workers were employed by Chinese American internet entrepreneurs in 2006 than were in 1996 by both Chinese and Indian executives?","output":"First, let's identify the number of workers employed by both Chinese and Indian executives in 1996, which is 46,000 workers according to the given text. Then, we will find out the number of workers employed by Chinese American internet entrepreneurs in 2006, which is 58,000. Now, to find out how many more workers were employed by Chinese American internet entrepreneurs in 2006 than were in 1996 by both Chinese and Indian executives, we subtract the number of employees in 1996 from the number of employees in 2006. 58,000 (employees in 2006) - 46,000 (employees in 1996) = 12,000 There were 12,000 more workers employed by Chinese American internet entrepreneurs in 2006 than were in 1996 by both Chinese and Indian executives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century.  Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year...  Guess a valid title for it!

Many birds are threatened by habitat loss, though the golden eagle currently appears to have a stable population.

Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers of all time. He was also known for his unorthodox lifestyle, residing in a private amusement park he called Neverland Ranch, and often becoming the focus of tabloid scrutiny. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.  The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and in the early 1980s, became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Thriller\\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Bad (1987) was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. He continued to innovate throughout the 1990s with videos such as \\"Black or White\\" and \\"Scream\\", and forged a reputation as a touring artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized complicated dance techniques such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   In general, the process of interest is taking place in the system, and there are no changes in the composition of the surroundings. However, the temperature of the surroundings does generally change. Entropy changes in the surroundings are determined primarily by the flow of heat into or out of the system. In an exothermic process, heat flows into the surroundings, increasing the kinetic energy of the nearby particles. For an exothermic reaction, ΔS surr is positive. Conversely, heat flows from the surroundings into the system during an endothermic process, lowering the kinetic energy available to the surroundings and resulting in a negative value for ΔS surr .   Q: In what type of process does heat flow into its surroundings and cause an increase in kinetic energy?

After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota took first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 41-yard field goal. They increased their lead later in the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 9-yard TD pass. Cincinnati responded with quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Chad Ochocinco on a 15-yard TD pass, however the Vikings quickly scored two field goals by kicker Ryan Longwell (from 23 and 44 yards out) to put the Vikings up 16-7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally with kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Vikings put the game away with running back Adrian Peterson's 3-yard TD run. With the win, the Vikings not only improved to 11-2 on the season, they also secured a playoff berth for the second consecutive season and improved upon the record from the previous season (10-6). Their \\"magic number\\" decreased to one, meaning that either a Green Bay loss at Pittsburgh or a Vikings win against Carolina on Sunday night would make Minnesota repeat division champions for the first time since 1978, when they won six consecutive NFC Central titles.

LAS VEGAS, NV - OCTOBER 18: (L-R) Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry participate in the Republican presidential debate airing on CNN, October 18, 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)      Our take is below. Have thoughts of your own on the debate? The comments section awaits.      WINNERS      * Mitt Romney: It wasn’t his best debate but, as usual, the former Massachusetts governor found ways to come across as forceful and presidential. Romney was clearly put on defense on health care — by former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum of all people! — and was on the verge of the sort of “gang up” moment that he had successfully avoided in the debates to date. But Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann threw him a lifeline by changing the focus from Romney’s health care plan to President Obama’s health care law. (She wants to repeal it, in case you were wondering.) Romney’s answer on his Mormon faith — and religion’s broader role in the political space — was an absolute masterpiece. Romney didn’t coast in this debate as he had in the few that had preceded it. But he managed to navigate most of the rough patches with minimal damage done.      * Rick Perry’s aggression: The Texas governor made up his mind that after several dull and uninspired debate performances he was going to come out with both barrels blazing tonight. And, boy did he. At times, that change in style worked in his favor — particularly in the first 30 minutes or so of the debate when Perry delivered a cogent, energetic answer on energy and jobs. But, aggression giveth and aggression taketh away. (See below).      * Anderson Cooper: Moderating any event where two or more politicians are gathered on stage is difficult. Moderating a presidential debate with seven candidates is next to impossible. Cooper deserves tons of credit for keeping the debate lively, asking open-ended questions that invited interesting responses from the candidates and knowing when to step back and let the likes of Perry and Romney simply go at it. Job well done.      * Debate lovers: Overall, a terrific debate. As we have said many times before, elections are about choices and the best way for voters to make an informed decision is to watch the candidates not only make a case for themselves but against the other guys (and gal). Back and forth exchanges are a good thing. And there were lots (and lots) of them tonight.      * Food imagery: Apples! Oranges! Cakes being baked. The Fix needs to not watch these debates on an empty stomach.      LOSERS      * Herman Cain : For the first ten minutes of the debate, the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza was under near-constant attack over the specifics of his “9-9-9” plan. For the rest of the debate, he was almost nonexistent. Cain’s attempts to dismiss criticism of “9-9-9” — the apples, the oranges — weren’t terribly convincing and are ripe (wink, wink) for follow-ups in the coming days. And, when it came to foreign policy and national security, Cain seemed distracted at best and totally out of his depth at worst. His answer on the Guantanamo Bay prison was, um, not good.      * Michele Bachmann: Almost every answer the Minnesota Congresswoman gave was the dictionary definition of a non sequitur. Bachmann seemed intent on proving to anyone watching that she, more so than the other candidates on stage, really doesn’t like President Obama and wants to undo everything he has done. But, Bachmann seemed so intent on hitting her lines — she threw in the “we are going to make Barack Obama a one-term president” bit in a head-scratching coda to the debate — that it left the impression that she was participating in a conversation entirely apart from the one happening on stage. Just odd.      * Rick Perry’s bullying: Measured aggression in a political debate is a good thing. Unchecked aggression isn’t. And there were several times when Perry came dangerously close to stepping over that fine line. His repeated attacks on Romney employing illegals at his home were decidedly personal — although he did force Romney into an explanation of exactly what happened. Perry brought his swagger tonight but he may have applied it a bit too liberally at times.      * Ron Paul’s suit jacket: The Fix is, admittedly, a bit of a clotheshorse. But, anyone who has ever worn a suit could see that the Texas Congressman’s coat was at least two sizes to big. The ill-fitting coat made Paul look tiny, never a good image to project when you are running for president.

Take PostPolitics Facebook poll ||||| Talk about a fall classic.      Tuesday night’s fireworks-filled debate was the final in a series of five high-stakes debates held over a six-week period, with a hiatus until the next one in November. The strong impressions left from the CNN/Western Republican Leadership Conference event should last until then.      Text Size -      +      reset Romney, Perry spar at debate Cain: Apple vs. orange taxes Bachmann hits Obama's family POLITICO 44      Here are POLITICO’s nine takeaways from the spirited Las Vegas debate:      Mitt Romney is not a Teflon candidate            Romney did not have a bad debate. But his performance wasn’t as effective as in the previous four debates — his best-funded rival, Rick Perry, finally scored points against him.            Perry repeatedly cast the debate rules aside so he could land the blows he wanted — most notably when he turned directly to his rival and bluntly declared that Romney had hired “illegals” to work on his home.      Romney, who’s been so smooth in the rest of the debates, committed a handful of unforced errors in which he looked too calculating — the sin he is most frequently accused of. The former Massachusetts governor denied employing illegal immigrants at first — technically true — but then delivered this line in explaining what he said to the company who employed them at his home: “I’m running for office, for Pete’s sake, I can’t have illegals.”      He was visibly flustered when Perry interrupted him during the exchange, coming close to losing his temper at one point.      He didn’t actually lose it — but the video replay of the moment, which CNN ran at least twice within 30 minutes of the debate’s end — reflected poorly on him when viewed out of context.      It was inevitable that Romney was going to start seeing some tougher punches from his rivals. He looked strong defending himself when the remarks of an anti-Mormon pastor and Perry backer were discussed, and he made quick work of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich in exchanges over Romneycare, which made a sudden reappearance after barely being raised in past debates.      But Romney, the best debater of the field by far, now heads into a roughly three-week period without a chance to take the stage and do what he does best to correct any lingering bad impressions.      Rick Perry’s back in the ring      The on-the-ropes candidate had a dramatic turnaround Tuesday night after three debates during which he almost seemed asleep at times and barely able to form a sentence at others.      Throughout the debate, Perry supporters said privately that this was the candidate they’d been expecting when he announced his campaign in the summer — the one who demolished Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in a 2010 primary that he was initially expected to lose.      After those messy debate performances, the race stopped being Perry’s to lose. But he showed more than a pulse tonight, something that will make donors — and voters — who’ve gotten skittish about him give him a second look.      There were certainly moments when Perry made clear how much he likes going for the jugular, a quality that doesn’t always wear well in debates. He got booed by the Romney-friendly debate hall crowd a number of times.      Perry’s also still given to the occasional brain bubble as he’s talking — one of them caused some fairly mumbled filibustering about religion.      But he is now going to be able to paint himself again as a Romney alternative — the first rung on the ladder in climbing back toward running a competitive race.      Herman Cain likes fruit, if not details      No one rode into the debate with higher expectations than Cain, and it’s safe to say he fell short of them.      He wasn’t bad enough to lose any support, but Cain had considerable trouble explaining the finer points of his ubiquitous “9-9-9” plan.      The plan itself became a punching bag for the first 20 minutes of the debate, as Cain’s six rivals on stage took turns taking a whack at the math behind the concept. ||||| Please consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these ways      Here is what you would know: - Herman Cain is a likeable figure (IMHO), but he did a very bad job of defending his 9-9-9 plan against an entirely foreseeable all-hands attack in the first part of the debate. All he could say was that comparing it with other taxes was \\"apples and oranges.\\" About ten times. - Mitt Romney is not a likeable figure (IMO), but he knows what he is doing in a debate and has gotten steadily better at it. He can use logic (more of a distinguishing trait in this field than you would think); he can control his emotions; he can make others lose control of their emotions -- especially Perry, who looked like he wanted to land a big haymaker upside Mitt's head; and he can even use body language. He reached across to put his hand on Perry's shoulder in an unusual and no doubt infuriating \\"now, now, little man\\" gesture. - Imagining Obama on the stage with any of these other people is.. difficult to imagine. But he would be crazy not to prepare very carefully for Romney.      - Rick Santorum was angrier than in previous sessions. To me this was not a plus. - Rick Perry seemed to have tried harder than before in prep for this debate but still let himself get flustered and baited. - Substance point: Michele Bachmann's little pitch about the pain and helplessness of a family losing its house resembled Rick Perry's costly (for the hard-liners) empathy in the first debate for illegal-immigrants' children. In both cases, a glimmer of imagination that sometimes life is unfair, that \\"deserving\\" people can have bad luck, that there should be some provision of collective (gasp!) support for people on whom the market has turned thumbs down. Striking how much at odds those moments are with the tone of everything else. Ie, these are conceived of as minor exceptions to the otherwise perfect fairness of people's condition in life. - I don't think the GOP's projected share of the Latino vote went up very much after this debate, with constant reference to \\"magnets\\" to draw illegals northward and the varying merits of electrified and non-electric fences to keep them out. - In case you missed it: Romney is good at this. Pay attention. - Oh, yes, and by the way the cheesyness of the CNN production values, from the Survivor-style intro onward, is some kind of marker on the arc of national decline. That is all. How many more of these can there be? (I am posting this before the debate is actually over because I could not keep watching. If I missed something big, I have faith that it will be pointed out to me.) ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The eighth Republican presidential debate featured strong performances by Mitt Romney and Rick Perry but revealed vulnerabilities in Herman Cain's candidacy. Although Romney faced challenges on healthcare and his own hiring of illegal immigrants, he maintained an air of forcefulness and presidential demeanor. Perry displayed an aggressive strategy, which was both advantageous and disadvantageous at times, yet overshadowed poor performances in previous debates. Herman Cain, however, struggled to defend his \\"9-9-9\\" plan and appeared out of his depth in foreign policy and national security discussions. The lively debate showcased a number of back-and-forth exchanges, giving voters a clearer understanding of their choices in the election."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, also called RodeoHouston or abbreviated HLSR, is the largest livestock exhibitions and rodeo in the world. It also includes one of the richest regular-season rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003. It was previously held in the Astrodome. Context: One of the largest draws for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the 20 consecutive evenings of rodeo and concert, held in NRG Stadium. Tickets are relatively inexpensive, averaging about 29 in 2016, and also grant admission to the livestock show and fairgrounds. More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale. Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public.  RodeoHouston is run independently of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). It offers one of the largest prize purses in North America, over 2 million, but the winnings do not count towards the competitors' qualification for the PRCA National Finals Rodeo. RodeoHouston is an invitational, featuring 280 of the top professional cowboys. They compete in a playoff format, with the ultimate champion in each event earning 50,000. On the final evening, the rodeo hosts the Cinch SuperShootout. Champions from each of the top 10 rodeos in North America are invited to compete as teams in a subset of rodeo events. The finals and the SuperShoot are televised on Fox Sports.  After the professional rodeo concludes, children are given an opportunity to compete. Each evening, 30 high school students from across the state compete in the calf scramble. They are given the opportunity to chase down (on foot) and catch one of 15 calves, put a halter on them, and drag them back to the center of the stadium. Winners are given money to purchase their own heifer or steer to show the following year. Immediately following the calf scramble is mutton busting. Five- and six-year-olds wearing protective gear try to ride a sheep across a portion of the arena. On the last night of the rodeo, the winners from each of the previous evenings compete again to see who will become grand champion.  A rotating stage is then brought into the arena for the nightly concert. The majority of evenings are performances by country music singers, although several nights are dedicated to pop or rock music. The annual Tejano music night generally draws the largest crowds. The winner of the annual Mariachi Invitational competition is invited to perform onstage with the Tejano acts. Question: What kind of concerts perform?

The equation is: -542*l - 212*l - 10461 - 5489 = -71746 (-542 - 212) * l = -754*l So the equation becomes: -754*l - 10461 - 5489 = -71746 Step 2: Combine the constants. -10461 - 5489 = -15950 So the equation becomes: -754*l - 15950 = -71746 Step 3: Isolate the variable, l, by adding 15950 to both sides of the equation. -754*l = -71746 + 15950 Step 4: Solve this new equation for l. -754*l = -55796 Now, to isolate l, divide both sides by -754. l = -55796 / -754 l ≈ 74 So the value of l is approximately 74."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Summarize this article: Now that President Obama is all settled in to his second term, campaign adviser David Axelrod is lending a hand to Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is working on his own re-election bid. Monti's opposition, the Italian Democratic Party, is not happy to see Axelrod sticking his newly mustache-less face into Italy's politics, and they've created an attack ad to express their feelings on the subject. And while Axelrod has faced a wide, wide variety of attack ads in his time, we're pretty sure he's never seen one quite like this. The ad, which is featured on the party's website, has been translated as, \\"A guru recommended to Monti to attack his opponents. But the guru, sooner or later, will leave and Italy's problems will remain.\\" Fair enough — Axelrod is an American political strategist working abroad, after all.      Enlarge icon Pinterest icon Close icon      What's lost in the translation is the ad's photo, which seems to be a play on the similarities between Axelrod's last name and that of Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose. Sure, Rose has been something of a disappointment for the last couple decades or so, but are Italians really that upset by his failure to deliver Chinese Democracy? Or is something else going on here? ||||| Top Obama guru David Axelrod is getting a taste of rough-and-tumble politics abroad.      He is now advising Mario Monti, a candidate for the premiership in Italy, and his involvement has drawn a rather strange -- by American standards -- attack ad.      The ad, plastered across the top of the Italian Democratic Party's web site, compares Axelrod to Guns 'N' Roses frontman Axl Rose.      The quote on the ad from Monti's Democratic opponent Pier Luigi Bersani, roughly translated, says: A guru recommended to Monti to attack opponents. But the guru, sooner or later, they leave and Italy's problems remain.      Monti, the former Italian prime minister, is running as leader of a centrist alliance and with a slate of candidates using the slogan, \\"With Monti for Italy - a Civic Choice,\\" according to Italy Magazine. The magazine reports that Axelrod was in Rome earlier this month advising the candidate.      Axelrod did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: According to the passage, the writer thinks that  _  .

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Sugar enters the body - Bloodstream - The pancreas - Insulin lower sugar levels A:","output":"The final step in the process that starts with sugar entering the body and being regulated by insulin is sugar utilization and storage. Here's a detailed breakdown: 1. Sugar (glucose) enters the body through the consumption of carbohydrate-containing foods (e.g., bread, pasta, fruits, etc.). 2. The ingested carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars (mainly glucose) during digestion in the stomach and small intestine. 3. Glucose is then absorbed into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. 4. As a response to the rise in blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. 5. Insulin helps lower blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells throughout the body, particularly muscle and adipose (fat) tissues. 6. Inside the cells, glucose is either:    a) Utilized for energy production - the cells convert glucose into a usable form of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process known as cellular respiration.        b) Stored for future use - glucose can be transformed into glycogen (in muscle and liver cells) or fat (in adipose tissue) for later use when blood sugar levels are low, or when the body needs additional energy. In summary, the final step in this process is glucose being utilized as an immediate energy source or stored in the body for future energy needs.

This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2 So to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C When it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f Another time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine  and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it.

PUBLISHED:. 04:50 EST, 10 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:23 EST, 10 January 2013. Expensive: Temporary council worker Mike Boyle is raking in a whopping £779 a day at cash-strapped Southend Council in Essex. A temporary council worker is raking in a whopping £779 a day - earning more than both his own chief executive and the Prime Minister. Mike Boyle has been the interim head of adult commissioning at cash-strapped Southend Council in Essex since 2010. He remains in post today despite the council claiming it only recruits temporary staff as a stop-gap for vacancies or during periods of reorganisation. It emerged last week that senior stand-ins at Southend as well as Basildon and Essex County. Council cost £8million-a-year. In 2011/12, Mr Boyle would have been paid a staggering £187,154.40 based on his daily rate for 48 weeks - significantly more than council chief executive Rob Tinlin, who was on a basic salary of £148,881, and David Cameron, who is on £145,500. Mr Boyle, who works five days a week, was even on a higher rate than his current £779-a-day when he worked for the authority briefly in 2007, before he was drafted back three years later. Council leader Nigel Holdcroft said Mr Boyle was in post because the authority had been unable to find a permanent head of adult commissioning since 2010. Mr Tinlin said: 'When the post became vacant again 2010, we were unable to recruit to this position so Mike returned to fill the post in the interim, from June 2010 at a reduced rate of pay. 'Over the period Mike has been acting for the council, this and other posts have been filled on temporary arrangements to facilitate service reviews and a review of the senior management structure.' Southend Council would not say what Mr Boyle's original daily rate was before it was scaled back, but a slice of it will be paid to a recruitment agency, who provided My Boyle. Temporary: Mr Boyle has been the interim head of adult commissioning at cash-strapped Southend Council, Essex, since 2010. Opposition leaders have called on the council to make better use of its money particularly as its budget is set to be slashed by the Government later this year while unions say 90 jobs are at risk. Martin Terry, leader of the opposition independent party, said: 'We are looking at more cuts this year and when you set that against the backdrop of these huge salaries it makes me angry. 'The council should be looking at training and using some of their existing staff to temporary fill in rather than bringing in staff at a ridiculous cost to the taxpayer.' Graham Longley, leader of the Liberal Democrat Group in Southend, said: 'Interim staff is quite acceptable providing they are temporary and once they go beyond what is a reasonable timeframe for a temporary member of staff, they should not be in post. 'I'm surprised no-one has picked up on the fact that Mr Boyle has been in his role so long in terms of his temporary contract.' Interim members of staff are not entitled to pensions or holiday and sick pay, and Southend Council claims that it has reduced its numbers of temporary staff over the past few years. The council says Mr Boyle has played a major role in shaping council policy during his time in Southend. Since returning to the authority in 2010, he has taken the lead in a number of projects which have taken months and even years to reach fruition. Pricey: It emerged last week that Essex County Council, pictured, employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million. Nigel Holdcroft, leader of Southend Council, defended the authority. He said: 'When we employ interims they have always been for a good reason, either because we have been unable to find a suitable appointment or where we anticipate that there is likely to be a reconstructuring of areas of the council. 'Councils are under financial pressure and on occasion it's in the financial best interests to fill a post with an interim because it gives us greater flexibility. 'We can only appoint somebody full-time if we can find the right person to fill the role and we are confident that role is going to be retained in any future organisation. 'We go through great lengths to ensure the number of interim staff is kept to an absolute minimum and when they are appointed it is for a good reason and that reason is discussed by senior staff at the council.' At Basildon Council, one executive director who remains in a job is. paid £565-a-day and was among seven other staff who earned more than. £300 a day. They were all hired through agencies. One interim executive director has been in post since August 2011 and is not due to leave until April 2013. In total, Basildon Council spent £501,000 on temporary staff in 2011-12,. while Southend's seven temporary employees cost a total of £330,000. Essex County Council, which has cut almost 1,000 workers since 2009,. employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million.  Two of the temps were. paid more than £900-a-day. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said last week: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked that local authorities in the county are spending so much money on interim staff. ‘Temporary staff may be needed sometimes to fill roles in the short term, but these figures suggest they are being used for far longer than that by local authorities which is an enormous waste of money. ‘Councils need to explain why these staff were needed or to take action to deliver better value for our money.’ Mr Boyle has declined to comment.

Second question: What are the pros and cons of client server network? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options: (I). no. (II). yes.","output":"First, let's address both questions since they are essentially asking the same thing: Yes, both questions are asking the same thing (Option II). They are both focused on the pros and cons of client-server networks. Now, let's delve into the pros and cons of client-server networks. Client-server networks are a type of network architecture where a central server is responsible for managing and processing data, applications, or services, while multiple client machines request and receive the processed information. The benefits and drawbacks of using client-server networks can be found in various aspects of network management, security, and performance. Pros of Client-Server Networks: 1. Centralized Management: One of the main advantages of client-server networks is centralized management, which simplifies setup, installation, and maintenance of software applications and network resources. This allows for efficient management of system updates, security, and the overall performance of the network. 2. Scalability: Client-server networks are easily scalable, allowing businesses to grow and expand their information technology infrastructure without compromising its efficiency. Additional servers can be added as needed to enhance network performance and handle greater workloads, while new clients can be easily incorporated into the existing network. 3. Improved Security: The centralized nature of client-server networks allows for enhanced security measures. Administrators can effectively manage data access permissions, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems on the central server, securing users' data and network resources. 4. Access Control: Client-server networks allow administrators to implement fine-grained access control, ensuring that users have access to only the data and resources they require, facilitating enhanced security and organization within the system. 5. Backup and Recovery: Centralized data storage means that administrators can easily implement backup and recovery strategies for all stored information. This simplifies the process of restoring lost or corrupted data in the event of a failure or threat to the system. Cons of Client-Server Networks: 1. Server Dependency: The biggest disadvantage of client-server networks is their reliance on the central server. Should the server go offline or experience a critical failure, clients lose access to the network resources, leading to potential downtime and productivity loss. 2. High Initial Costs: Setting up a client-server network requires a substantial investment in purchasing and maintaining dedicated servers, software licenses, and other necessary hardware components. Smaller organizations may struggle to cover these costs, and may need to find more cost-effective networking solutions. 3. Increased Complexity: A client-server network can be complex to set up, configure, and maintain compared to simpler network architectures. Organizations may need to hire specialized network administrators to ensure smooth operation and maintain the system effectively. 4. Bottleneck Potential: If the server becomes overloaded due to an influx of requests from clients or due to insufficient resources, the network's performance can suffer, leading to slowdowns and frustration for users. 5. Power Consumption and Cooling Costs: Client-server networks, especially those that include multiple servers or data centers, can consume significant amounts of electrical power, and they require expensive cooling systems to prevent overheating. These costs must be taken into consideration when deploying a client-server network infrastructure. To summarize, client-server networks offer numerous advantages, such as centralized management, scalability, and improved security. However, they also present challenges, including server dependency, high initial costs, and increased complexity. The pros and cons should be carefully weighed when deciding whether to implement such a network."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Complete the following sentence. Natalie really enjoyed singing publicly but Katrina did not as  Available choices: (1). Natalie had a dreadful singing voice. (2). Katrina had a dreadful singing voice.","output":"Katrina did not enjoy singing publicly as she had a dreadful singing voice. Unlike Natalie who relished the chance to perform and whose melodic tones were welcomed by the audience, the very thought of singing in a public space filled Katrina with dread and often led to anxiety. This was primarily due to her less than perfect singing abilities.  Despite regular practice sessions and numerous attempts to improve over the years, Katrina accepted her fate - her voice was simply not cut out for singing. A range of vocal coaches had managed to improve her voice to some extent, however, it never reached a level suitable for public performances. Her voice invariably went off-key at high pitches and her control over her vocal range was minimal, resulting in a voice that could not grace the stage with the same allure as Natalie's. Moreover, climbing on stage and presenting herself in front of others was far more daunting for Katrina than it was for Natalie. The possibility of people's judgement, the fear of their possible critiques and the uncomfortableness of being the center of attention contributed to her aversion. Unlike Natalie, who was a natural in front of the crowd and thrived under the spotlight, Katrina was more reserved and introverted. Public displays were not her strong suit and singing, especially with her less than perfect voice, made it all the more uncomfortable. Katrina did not let this fact hinder her love for music though. Her inability to sing well did not diminish her enjoyment of music and she continued to explore its world, often being Natalie's biggest fan and supporter. From the comfort of her own home, she sang to her heart's content, enjoying music without the strain of public critique. Although she did not share Natalie's talent or passion for public singing, Katrina relished music in her own unique way. Thus, it may be concluded that while Natalie enjoyed singing publicly, Katrina didn't as she had a dreadful singing voice. But, their shared love for music kept them on common ground, each finding joy in their own distinct musical journeys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"Some types of light bulbs Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a significant risk factor for developing skin cancer. UV radiation is emitted naturally by the sun but can also be produced artificially by certain types of light bulbs. Artificial sources of UV radiation include tanning beds, black lights, and some types of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) lamps used in air and water purification systems. While not all light bulbs emit UV radiation, it is necessary to understand which types do and take necessary precautions to minimize exposure. Light bulbs such as traditional incandescent or fluorescent bulbs do emit trace amounts of UV radiation; however, it is generally not enough to cause concern. Several energy-saving light bulbs, like compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), are designed with a phosphor coating to block most UV emissions. Still, the long-term effects of exposure to these low levels of UV radiation remain uncertain. Other answer choices from the given list do not have a direct link to skin cancer or are unrelated to the topic. Gene Rayburn is a television personality and not connected to UV radiation exposure, while bad thoughts, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), water, direct damage to the lungs, sulfur dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons do not inherently cause skin cancer. Although DNA damage from UV radiation can lead to skin cancer, merely mentioning the presence of DNA is not enough to suggest a risk of skin cancer. In conclusion, the best answer from the given choices is \\"some types of light bulbs\\" due to their potential to emit ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer with excessive exposure. Awareness of artificial UV radiation sources and taking appropriate measures to minimize exposure can help reduce the risk of skin cancer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      The 2002 film starring Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys Myers and Parminder Nagra aired Dec. 26 _ a break from the regular programming of news, documentaries and soap operas in North Korea, where Western films are largely off limits.      \\"This was the first Western film to be broadcast on North Korean TV, and as well as football covered issues such as multiculturalism, equality and tolerance,\\" British Ambassador Peter Hughes told The Associated Press from Pyongyang, where his embassy helped arranged the Boxing Day broadcast.      Football is extremely popular in North Korea, which sent its men to the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 and whose women's team is a regional powerhouse.      Britain has been seeking to reach out to North Koreans through football, a sport that has connected the two nations since North Korea first sent a team to the World Cup in England in 1966.      Earlier in the year, the Middlesbrough Ladies Football Team traveled to Pyongyang to play North Korean clubs.      \\"The U.K. advocates a policy of engagement with North Korea because not engaging means not having any influence, and because engagement has the potential to catalyze change,\\" he said in an e-mail interview.      Hughes said he watched the film in Pyongyang, and AP monitored the broadcast in Seoul. The film that aired appeared to be an edited version.      \\"Bend it Like Beckham,\\" by director Gurinder Chadha, tells the story of a British Asian teen struggling with family pressures and cultural expectations as she plays the sport she loves and works to fulfill her dream of competing in the United States.      \\"Apparently the people were amazed that a Western film was shown, and there has been a buzz around the country as the people have talked about the film and its content,\\" Hughes said.      In a tweet Thursday, the British Ambassador to South Korea, Martin Uden, praised his counterparts at the British Embassy in Pyongyang for arranging the broadcast.      \\"Happy Christmas in Pyongyang. On 26/12 Bend it like Beckham was 1st ever western-made film to air on TV.

Pyongyang's state TV usually airs soap operas with nationalist themes or \\"news\\" programs praising the country's leaders.The British-made film stars Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Parminder Nagra. It hit theaters around the world in 2002, and the original version is 112 minutes long. But the version aired Dec. 26 on North Korean state TV was about 104 minutes long, suggesting some editing was done, the BBC reported The film is mostly about a young girl who aspires to become a soccer star, but it also touches on topics deemed as taboos in the reclusive, tightly controlled communist North: homosexuality, interracial relationships and religion.During the rare broadcast, a message scrolled along the screen saying it was shown to mark the 10th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Britain and Pyongyang.Soccer is hugely popular in North Korea, where the men's national team qualified for and traveled to the World Cup in South Africa this past summer.

Which is the longest line on the London Underground Railway system?","output":"The longest line on the London Underground Railway system is the Central line. The Central line is one of the 11 lines that make up the London Underground, commonly known as the Tube. It runs on an east-west direction, connecting the easternmost suburbs to the western suburbs of London. The Central line is approximately 74 kilometers (46 miles) in length, making it the longest line on the London Underground network. It serves 49 stations, which is the second-highest number of stations served by a single line, after the District line. The Central line is recognizable by its red color on the Tube map. The Central line was first opened in 1900, initially running between Bank in the City of London and Shepherd's Bush in West London.

The KLF (also known as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, furthermore known as The JAMs and The Timelords and by other names) were a British electronic band of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Beginning in 1987, Bill Drummond (alias King Boy D) and Jimmy Cauty (alias Rockman Rock) released hip hop-inspired and sample-heavy records as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, and on one occasion (the British number one hit single \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\") as the Timelords. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label, and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991. The duo also published a book, The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way), and worked on a road movie called The White Room. In 1986, Bill Drummond was an established figure within the British music industry, having co-founded Zoo Records, played guitar in the Liverpool band Big in Japan, and worked as manager of Echo & the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. On 21 July of that year, he resigned from his position as an A&R man at record label WEA, citing that he was nearly 33 1/3  years old (33 1/3  revolutions per minute being significant to Drummond as the speed at which a vinyl LP revolves), and that it was \\"time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top\\". He released a well-received solo LP, The Man, judged by reviewers as \\"tastefully understated,\\" a \\"touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement\\" encapsulating \\"his bizarrely sage ruminations\\", and \\"a work of humble genius: the best kind\\".  Artist and musician Jimmy Cauty was, in 1986, the guitarist in the commercially unsuccessful three-piece Brilliant--an act that Drummond had signed to WEA Records and managed. Cauty and Drummond shared an interest in the esoteric conspiracy novels The Illuminatus! Trilogy and, in particular, their theme of Discordianism, a form of post-modern anarchism. As an art student in Liverpool, Drummond had been involved with the set design for the first stage production of The Illuminatus! Trilogy, a 12-hour performance which opened in Liverpool on 23 November 1976.  Re-reading Illuminatus! in late 1986, and influenced by hip-hop, Drummond felt inspired to react against what he perceived to be the stagnant soundscape of popular music. Recalling that moment in a later radio interview, Drummond said that the plan came to him in an instant: he would form a hip-hop band with former colleague Jimmy Cauty, and they would be called the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu.  It was New Year's Day ... 1987. I was at home with my parents, I was going for a walk in the morning, it was, like, bright blue sky, and I thought \\"I'm going to make a hip-hop record. Who can I make a hip-hop record with?\\". I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself, 'cause, although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [Jimmy], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said \\"Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu\\". And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, \\"where I was coming from\\". And within a week we had recorded our first single which was called \\"All You Need Is Love\\".

News article: Mad as hell, at the corporate powers that be ●Aug. 20: Two weeks of sit-ins begin at the White House; before they’re over, 1,253 people have been arrested for protesting the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, the biggest civil disobedience actions since the 1980s. ●Sept. 17: The first few hundred protesters arrive in New York for Occupy Wall Street, their numbers and visibility soon surging and sympathy occupations eventually popping up across the country. More than 700 are arrested in a single day. Something fresh is afoot in this country, drawing its inspiration from the Arab Spring. It’s what Van Jones, head of Rebuild the Dream, has taken to calling “the American Autumn.” Yes, that Van Jones, the one the White House unceremoniously dumped overboard after Glenn Beck (preposterously) called him a communist. Now Jones is back on stage — and so is a strain of American populism that many have been waiting to see emerge. No one knows if it will turn into political action, à la the Tea Party, or morph into something altogether new. But the energy is undeniable — even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said he understood the anger of Wall Street protesters. In certain ways, this kind of protest is long overdue. Wall Street in recent days has had the feel of Seattle amid the huge World Trade Organization demonstrations of 2000, a nascent movement against concentrated wealth whose fires were banked by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. That anxiety might have erupted again amid the financial crisis of 2008, but many were willing to put their trust in Barack Obama and on the wings of a campaign that promised transformative change. Many of us were waiting for him to take decisive action — action that has never come. One reason may be the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision that allowed Wall Street, and the rest of corporate America, to, well, occupy the public square. When that decision came down, it was almost as though big business said: We’re not even going to pretend any more. We run this country. So this American Autumn is a push-back against the ever-expanding powers of the elite. Take the Keystone pipeline battle: The administration outsourced the environmental review to a firm that had worked for the pipeline builder. As e-mails released recently under the Freedom of Information Act revealed, a State Department official was cheering on the pipeline project, perhaps because Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton’s former deputy campaign manager is its chief lobbyist. A few days ago, reporters uncovered evidence that the Koch brothers, the third- and fourth-richest men in this country, had “direct and significant” ties to the pipeline. In other words: The game was wired. Wired for pipelines, for bank bailouts, for benefit cuts, for all the things that corporate America has ever wanted, and none of the things that people suffering in a dead economy on a heating planet need and deserve. Some have complained that the movement is inchoate, that it hasn’t issued a list of demands, that it has no leader. Perhaps those will emerge in time; more crucial is the debate underway in occupied downtown parks and engaged Internet forums, about how to shoulder aside connection and privilege and reinstall a democracy that works for “the other 99 percent.” It owes a little something to the Tea Party, but it identifies the real enemy less in government than in the corporate power that so easily manipulates that government. And if the Tea Party speaks to an older generation deprived of the America its adherents remember, this new movement speaks to a younger generation robbed of the future it had been led to expect. It would be folly to predict how all this will evolve. But there are a couple of dates you can put on the calendar: ●Nov. 6: Pipeline protesters will return to the White House, one year before the next election, to encircle it with thousands of activists. We’ll be carrying signs with Obama’s words from the 2008 campaign (“time to end the tyranny of oil”). This may be one of the president’s last chances to make peace with this emerging force. ●Nov. 17: The Rebuild the Dream campaign promises thousands of “visible, urgent actions,” modeled on Occupy Wall Street, around its “jobs not cuts” theme. Notice the Twitter hashtags already springing up: #occupyphoenix, #occupyindianapolis. It’s spreading. And after that, who knows? Which is the point. By the time autumn is over and winter descends, our politics may look very different. Bill McKibben is Schumann Dintinguished Scholar at Middlebury College and an organizer of tarsandsaction.org. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. The rise of the \\"American Autumn\\" protests, inspired by the Arab Spring, which include sit-ins at the White House against the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline and the Occupy Wall Street movement. These movements signify a growing public dissatisfaction with corporate power and influence on the government. 2. The Keystone XL pipeline controversy, where the environmental review was conducted by a firm with ties to the pipeline builder and evidence suggests that the Koch brothers have significant ties to the project. This situation highlights the perception of corruption and collusion between corporations and the government. 3. The Occupy Wall Street movement, which is marked by its lack of a central leader and a defined set of demands, but focuses on the issues of wealth concentration, corporate power, and the need to rebuild democracy for the \\"other 99 percent.\\" 4. The uncertain future of these protests and movements, but the potential for them to grow and evolve, including upcoming demonstrations like the pipeline protest on Nov. 6 at the White House and the Rebuild the Dream campaign on Nov. 17.

While he was hiking on the Baltic coast with a nature appreciation group,he threw the bottle into the sea. Then the researchers began a search for any living relatives of his.

He grew up in Mississippi and rose to fame as the bass singer for the American pop boy band NSYNC. NSYNC's success led Bass to work in film and television. He starred in the 2001 film On the Line, which his company, Bacon & Eggs, also produced. Context: Bass came out as gay in a cover story for People magazine on July 26, 2006. There had been considerable media speculation about his orientation due to numerous paparazzi snapshots of him at gay bars and nightclubs, most notably during the preceding Independence Day weekend in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton had also been posting items on his website about Bass's orientation since September 2005, and New York gossip column Page Six ran a blurb on July 12, 2006, that reported a sighting of Bass at a gay bar with his then-boyfriend, Reichen Lehmkuhl. Bass's publicist, Ken Sunshine, chose to release the story exclusively to People magazine, who bumped actor Johnny Depp off of that week's cover in favor of Bass. In his coming out interview, Bass stated,  Bass's announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving \\"overwhelming support\\" from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as \\"straight-acting\\" in his People interview, stating, \\"I call them the SAGs - the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer.\\" This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a \\"mistake\\" and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, \\"Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed.\\"  Bass found himself in the midst of further controversy later that year when he, along with then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl, was awarded the 2006 Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award on October 7, 2006. The Washington Blade printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets. The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, \\"Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today.\\" Question: was was the controversy?. Whats the answer?","output":"The controversy surrounding James Lance Bass's coming out as gay in a cover story for People magazine in 2006 involved several aspects. Initially, there was media speculation about his orientation, with numerous paparazzi photos of him at gay bars and nightclubs, as well as gossip columns and bloggers discussing his sexuality.  The first major issue arose when Bass referred to himself and his friends as \\"straight-acting\\" in his coming out interview, stating he and his friends were \\"just normal, typical guys\\" who enjoyed activities like watching football and drinking beer. This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who felt that this statement not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but also reinforced unnecessary stereotypes. Bass later admitted in a 2007 interview with The Advocate that his comment was a \\"mistake\\" and acknowledged that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term at the time. The second part of the controversy happened when Bass and his then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl were awarded the 2006 Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Visibility Award on October 7, 2006. A long-time HRC supporter published a guest editorial in the Washington Blade, claiming that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and accused the HRC of capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets. The HRC defended Bass and his award, arguing that his decision to come out initiated a positive, national conversation and was a significant cultural moment. In summary, the controversy surrounding James Lance Bass's coming out focused on his use of the term \\"straight-acting\\", which offended some members of the LGBT community, and the subsequent criticism of his receipt of the HRC Visibility Award, with claims that he had not done enough to deserve it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The film transports its audience to a modern-day Los Angeles infused with the charm and nostalgia of classic Hollywood. The story centers around the budding relationship between the dreamy aspiring actress, Mia (Emma Stone), and the idealistic jazz pianist, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). Both individuals embark on a quest to achieve their respective dreams while exploring the importance of love, compromise, and the lengths they would go to hold on to their passions. Among the many highlights of \\"La La Land,\\" Chazelle's writing and direction are simply spectacular. The colorful cinematography by Linus Sandgren dazzles and mesmerizes the viewer with dazzling pastel shades and sweeping camera movements. The meticulous attention to detail with each sequence builds a vibrant and breathtaking world where you can't help but get lost in its dreamy allure. Musical compositions by Justin Hurwitz effortlessly blend with Chazelle's vision, drawing the audience into the film's emotional landscape and punctuating each scene with a sense of wonder and whimsy. Songs like \\"City of Stars,\\" \\"Audition (The Fools Who Dream),\\" and \\"A Lovely Night\\" reflect the film's themes of hopes, ambition and the indomitable human spirit. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling prove once again that they are the quintessential on-screen couple, providing us with an electrifying chemistry that is charming, powerful, and palpably real. Stone brings a sense of vulnerability and resilience to her character, making it easy for audiences to root for her as she chases her dreams. Gosling's deft portrayal of a man devoted to his art while striving to keep love alive makes him the perfect counterpart to Stone. Their captivating performances, along with their superb singing and dancing, draw the audience into their tender love story while also reflecting the individual struggles they face along the way. It would be remiss not to mention the masterful choreography of Mandy Moore, who brings a unique and innovative approach to every dance number. From the opening sequence on a congested freeway to the duet between Stone and Gosling in the Hollywood Hills, every movement feels fresh, enchanting, and perfectly timed. \\"La La Land\\" is not only a celebration of cinema's ability to move and enchant us but also an examination of dreams, love, and the compromises we must make in pursuit of our aspirations. The film's conclusion leaves a lasting, bittersweet impression, a testament to the sacrifices and devastating choices life may demand from us. Ultimately, \\"La La Land\\" is a visual and musical masterpiece, blending nostalgia with modern themes to create an unforgettable cinematic experience, elevating itself beyond the realms of traditional musicals and offering an authentic, innovative experience that deserves every accolade thrown its way. With its captivating performances, breathtaking cinematography, and soaring soundtrack, \\"La La Land\\" leaves its viewers with a sense of wonder, urging them to chase their dreams and embrace life's endless possibilities, no matter the obstacles that may lie ahead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you use a pedometer? Choose from: (i). leave it at home when you go for walks. (ii). take a walk and have it on your person at all times for it to track your steps.","output":"The better solution for using a pedometer to achieve the goal of tracking your steps during walks is: (ii). Take a walk and have it on your person at all times for it to track your steps. A pedometer is a device specifically designed to count the number of steps a person takes while walking or running. It helps people to monitor their daily physical activity, set goals for themselves, and keep track of their progress over time. This information can be incredibly helpful when attempting to improve one's physical fitness and overall health. To fully utilize a pedometer, leaving it at home ((i)) defeats the purpose of the device as it would not be able to record your steps throughout the day. In contrast, having the device on your person at all times ((ii)) allows it to accurately count your steps as you take each one, ensuring the device functions optimally and provides you with beneficial information. Moreover, let's further break down option (ii) and explore some essential tips to use a pedometer effectively: 1. Proper placement: To ensure accuracy, wear the pedometer at your waistline, attaching it to your belt or waistband. Most pedometers work best when placed in line with your knee, allowing it to accurately detect the swinging motion of your leg as you walk or run. 2. Calibration: Make sure to set the device to your specific stride length. This enables the device to account for your unique gait and deliver more accurate results. Most pedometers have instructions guiding you on how to measure your stride length and input that information into the device. 3. Daily goals: Set daily step goals for yourself to encourage regular physical activity. A common recommendation is to aim for 10,000 steps a day, an effective benchmark for promoting general fitness and weight management. 4. Consistency: Check your step count regularly and make a habit of wearing your pedometer every day. This will make it easier for you to track your progress over time and maintain a consistent level of activity. 5. Record your progress: Maintain a log or use a fitness app to record your daily step counts and other statistics, like distance traveled and calories burned. This can provide motivation and encouragement as you see your progress over time. In conclusion, the most effective solution to using a pedometer to track your steps during walks is to have it on your person at all times throughout the day (option (ii)). This allows the device to accurately record your step count and help you monitor your daily physical activity, set goals, and assess your progress towards better health and fitness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from the following. a). no b). yes","output":"b). yes The two questions, \\"What are any real life instances where karma played its role?\\" and \\"What are some real life examples of Karma?\\" do, indeed, have the same meaning. Both queries deal with seeking instances or examples of the concept of karma in real-life situations. Karma is the belief that our actions, whether they be positive or negative, will affect us in the future, culminating in a system of cause and effect. Below are a few real-life examples of karma in action. 1. Phan Thi Kim Phuc: Kim Phuc is famous for being the subject of the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph, \\"Napalm Girl,\\" taken during the Vietnam War. A South Vietnamese aircraft dropped a napalm bomb on her village, resulting in severe burns along her back and arms. Kim Phuc spent over a year in the hospital, enduring multiple surgeries and continuous pain. She later became a goodwill ambassador for UNESCO and established the Kim Foundation International–a nonprofit aimed at providing medical and psychological care for child victims of war. Despite her suffering, she displayed immense compassion and dedicated herself to the betterment of others, ultimately finding peace and forgiveness in her life. 2. John Spano: John Spano, a wealthy businessman, seemed to be at the peak of his success when he agreed to buy the New York Islanders, an NHL team, for 165 million in 1996. However, it soon became apparent that Spano had lied about his wealth and had been leading a life based on deception, including fraudulent activities and scams. As a result of his actions, he ended up in prison, lost his career and wealth, and faced public shame – a clear example of karma at work. 3. James R. Herman: James R. Herman was a truck driver who intentionally swerved his vehicle to run over a tortoise, taking a photograph of the crushed animal afterward. This gruesome post went viral on social media, leading to outrage from people worldwide. Several days later, Herman was involved in a road accident that cost him his job. People noted that this was an example of karmic retribution for his apparent disregard for living beings. 4. Seaworld Profits Decline: Since the release of the documentary \\"Blackfish\\" in 2013, which exposed the mistreatment of orcas in captivity, SeaWorld has experienced continued backlash and decline in profits. The documentary spurred a public shift in consciousness, resulting in a significant drop in attendance and financial support. This instance can be viewed as karmic retribution in which a collective harmful action, in this case, the mistreatment of orcas, led to negative consequences for the organization. 5. Humanitarian Aid Worker Stories: Numerous humanitarian aid workers have shared instances in which their acts of kindness were repaid, whether immediately or years later. Helping those in need, such as after a natural disaster or during a conflict, resulted in instances where they were provided help in their times of need. These examples showcase the universal principle that actions, particularly those harming or benefiting others, often result in corresponding consequences. While \\"karma\\" is traditionally rooted in Eastern religions, the concept transcends cultural and religious lines, emphasizing that our actions do indeed hold weight and have the potential for both reward and retribution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ted Brown's dream as a child was an unusual one: he wanted to fly. What was more unusual was the way in which he made his dream come true. After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons  to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee  of his \\"plane\\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined   1,500 for breaking the law about air safety.

That is the case with static stretching, or holding the muscles still in a stretched out position. Dynamic stretching, on the other hand, involves deliberate motions which gently stretch your muscles in preparation for more rigorous exercise. Performing these exercises can greatly reduce the risk of hurting yourself or developing a cramp. It is important to warm up every muscle group in your body prior to exercising. Some dynamic exercises you can do for the upper body include:  Arm circles. Extend your arms out to either side and gently rotate them in a tight, circular motion. Shoulder rolls. Stand up straight and slowly rotate your shoulders backward. Try to touch your shoulders to your ears as you do this. After a few repetitions, switch directions and move your shoulders forward. For a cardiovascular workout that involves running, jogging or hiking, it is crucial to warm up your legs. For weight training, your legs need to be prepared to do most of the heavy lifting. Here are some examples of dynamic leg exercises:  Lunges. With your hands on your hips, take one large step forward. As your foot touches the ground, drop your back knee straight down as far as you can without touching the ground. Pushing off your back foot, swing your back leg to the front, repeating the dropping motion with the other leg. Knee lifts. Instead of dropping your knee downward, lift your opposite knee up to your chest as you take a step forward. This should look like a very exaggerated march. Back muscles are extremely prone to cramping during all types of exercise if they have not been properly warmed up. There are tons of different back exercises, including:  Torso twists. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms bent at a 90-degree angle. Gently twist your torso back and forth. This motion mobilizes your spine. Standing back bends. With your hands on your hips and feet shoulder-width apart, lean back slightly, pressing your hip bones forward. Return your upper body to the upright position, and repeat several times.","output":"This article says that instead of static stretching, using dynamic stretching by moving and gently stretching muscles before exercising helps to warm up your whole body and prevent injuries or cramps."},{"instruction":"Q:I can use this background: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries.  Now, I have a new situation: John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B.  Answer this question please: In which case the number of mesopredators would decrease, case A or case B? A:","output":"The number of mesopredators would decrease in Case A. In Case A, the Siberian tiger population is stable, which means the apex predator is effectively controlling mesopredator populations. In Case B, the introduction of guns led to the decrease of Siberian tigers, which can result in mesopredator release, allowing mesopredator populations to increase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An ocean away from Washington worries, President Barack Obama opened his annual Hawaii vacation Saturday on a quiet note - and hoped it would stay that way for the next two weeks. Every year, Obama and his family return to his birth state on the sun-scorched shores of Oahu. And every year - until now - congressional squabbling has forced the Obamas to delay their trip or cut it short. This year, Obama was cleared for an on-time departure by Congress, which defied pessimistic expectations last week by passing a bipartisan budget deal, all but ensuring the government won't shut down over the next two years. It was a far cry from presaging a new era of cooperation, to be sure, but a silver lining for Obama a day earlier as he acknowledged a year of frustrating 'ups and downs' in an end-of-year news conference. Scroll down for video. Take me to the golf course, driver! Obama covered up with a hat and sunglasses as he was taken to a local Marine Corps base for a round of golf with friends. Holiday starts now: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama disembark Air Force One after arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for their family Christmas vacation on Friday, Dec. 20, 2013, in Honolulu. US President Barack Obama(2nd-L) First Lady Michelle (L) and their daughters Malia (R) and Sasha (2nd-R) disembark Air Force One at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu, Hawaii, on December 20, 2013. The president, first lady Michelle. Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, and first dogs Sunny and Bo hopped an. overnight flight Friday aboard Air Force One to Honolulu, where they. were whisked by motorcade to a beachside home in Kailua, a sleepy suburb. with a five-mile stretch of beach popular among windsurfers and. tourists. The next. morning Obama, typically an early riser, got a late start, staying at. the home until early afternoon, when he headed to the golf course at a. nearby Marine Corps base. Joining Obama for the round of golf were Sam. Kass, the White House chef; Marvin Nicholson, Obama's trip director; and. the president's friend Bobby Titcomb, the White House said. Obama,. in white golf shirt, hat and sunglasses, was all smiles as he drove. past reporters accompanying him to the coastal golf course.

President Barack Obama, second from left, and first lady Michelle Obama, left, meet with various representatives of the military after disembarking from Air Force One at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers 100,000. The president has no public events scheduled during his vacation, which is expected to last through January 5. In previous years, frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings. A few weeks of low-key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for Obama, who reflected on a high-stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for Hawaii. 'The end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Obama said Friday. 'I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.' Last year, Obama had to temporarily abandon his vacation to fly home amid a congressional standoff over the so-called fiscal cliff. The year before, a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his Hawaii hiatus. In 2010, it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip. And in 2009, Senate deliberations over Obama's signature health care law meant that Honolulu had to wait another few days. Christmas traditions: The Obama will surely stop by Island Snow in Kailua for some shaved ice, as they did in 2010 (pictured) The Obama's will cover the cost of their accommodation, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill. Conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time. Obama did spend part of Saturday morning conferring with top national security aides about the situation in South Sudan, where U.S. military aircraft evacuating Americans from the violence-plagued African nation came under gunfire and had to divert to Uganda. The White House said four U.S. troops were injured in that incident. Throughout his vacation Obama will continue to get regular briefings from advisers traveling with him, White House officials said. Obama and his supporters were hoping those routine updates wouldn't interfere with regular rounds of golf and family outings for shave ice, the Hawaii version of a snow cone. 'I don't want any interruptions. He deserves a vacation,\\" Brian Pritchett, an assistant principal visiting from Mount Vernon, New York, said as he sipped a rum-infused drink dubbed the 'Obama Mama' at a Honolulu hotel. 'He puts in too many hours to not have his vacation with his family. I know that's what I would do.'

This article: Following a 31 March 2002 release on record label Eleven, Diorama reached number one on the ARIA Albums Chart on 14 April, making it Silverchair's fourth chart-topping album. It went on to be certified triple-platinum by ARIA, indicating sales in excess of 210,000 copies. The album peaked at number seven in New Zealand, thirteen in Austria, forty in Switzerland, and 116 in France. Diorama reached number ninety-one on the U.S. Billboard 200.The first single, \\"The Greatest View\\", was released in advance of the album on 28 January 2002. It reached number three in Australia, where it was also certified gold, and number four in New Zealand and Canada. It charted at number thirty-six on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2007 when re-released alongside the band's next album, Young Modern. Johns wrote \\"The Greatest View\\" as a response to the media \\"always watching [him] in different way\\". It was not intended to be aggressive, rather a straightforward commentary on the media frenzy that had surrounded the band for many years.On 13 May 2002, \\"Without You\\" was released as the second single. It peaked at number eight in Australia, but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, only spending five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999, when he told fans the band had \\"a very small cache of recorded material stored away\\", including \\"Without You\\". \\"Without You\\" was followed by \\"Luv Your Life\\", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a therapy session, based on the idea that \\"there were people in the world who needed treatment but couldn't afford therapy.\\" Johns composed most of the song's lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at London's Shepherds Bush Empire, Johns jokingly said \\"Luv Your Life\\" was dedicated \\"to all my ladies\\".\\"After All These Years\\", a promotional single, followed \\"Luv Your Life\\", but failed to reach the charts.

In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide.  But I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  What is an answer for this question: Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? A:","output":"Reaction A, in which sodium oxide is in the form of small particles, will occur at a faster rate. This is because the small particles have a greater surface area compared to the large chunks in reaction B, which allows for more frequent collisions between reactant particles and an increased rate of reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Authorities stormed an arriving cargo ship believed to have Pakistani stowaways on board - some of which are reportedly dead. The ship came in to New Jersey’s Port Newark this morning to waiting Port Authority police, Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and Coast Guard officials. By midday Wednesday, all but one ambulance had quietly left the pier. Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said officials have inspected 150 of the 200 containers authorities believe could be carrying people. Scroll down for video. At the ready: Authorities wait for the arriving cargo ship believed to have Pakistani stowaways on board. Alert: Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said that crew members on the Ville D'Aquarius heard what sounded like people in a shipping container on the ship. Out in force: Police vehicles are parked at the entrance of the Port of Newark to investigate reports of stowaways in a container aboard the cargo ship. The New York Post reported that officials have also been using X-ray gear to examine the containers in question and are yet to find any stowaways. The drama began early this morning when a routine inspection aboard the Ville D'Aquarius showed signs of what may be people in a container on the ship. Row told the Post: 'The. boarding team went aboard for a routine inspection. They heard sounds. that were consistent with people being inside a container.' Coast Guard spokeswoman Michelle Krupa told the Star-Ledger: 'The officers were knocking on. containers during a sound check, and they knocked on this one and they. heard a knocking back.' Customs and Border Patrol agents also met the vessel at the port. Crews are now inspecting the shipping containers one-by-one as they are lifted off of the ship by huge mechanical cranes - a process that could take hours. Search: Officials were seen scouring the ship's cargo containers one-by-one. Security: The ship's crew followed protocol by not opening the container believed to contain the stowaways in an effort to control the situation. The ship's manifest said the container in question was carrying machine parts to be unloaded in Norfolk, Virginia. Rowe said the boarding party didn't open the container at sea in an effort to control the situation, following protocol. A Coast Guard team boarded the. 850-foot-long vessel near the Verrazano Bridge outside New York Harbor at about 1am as the ship. prepared to dock at Port Newark. NBC New York reported that about 2,000 shipping containers are on board. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that officials are conducting a 'thorough investigation of the vessel.' Inspection: Authorities were seen opening and checking the cargo containers as they were lifted off the cargo ship. Waiting: Numerous law enforcement vehicles, including ambulances were seen on the pier as the ship was investigated. Drew Barry, of the Sandy Hook Pilots Association, said he boarded the vessel at 5am, about 20 miles offshore. Barry, who left the ship at around 9am, said he thought it would take several hours, if not much of the. day, to get to the part of the ship, below the hatch cover, where. officials heard banging noises. He said: 'There are at least 30 to 40 containers on top of the hatch cover, and I don't know how many more below it. Stowaway: Asem Haroon was detained after he claimed he had arrived in teh U.S. by stowing away on an Italian vessel. 'If there are people down there, with no food and water for days, they're probably pretty desperate by now.' Customs and Border Protection agents planned to open the container once it was unloaded. Officials told NBC New York that harbours in and around the Empire State get about six stowaways each year. The ship began its voyage May 30 in the United Arab Emirates, then made one stop in Pakistan and two stops in India. Its last port before Newark was in Egypt on June 15. The situation has raised security concerns over a possible new method for terrorists to infiltrate America's borders. Last year, an Egyptian man found living in a New Jersey warehouse claimed he had arrived in the U.S. by stowing away on a ship to Port Newark. The Post reported that the mysterious man, Asem Haroon, was suspected of fighting against U.S. troops in Iraq. It's unclear how he managed to make the journey, or whether or not he came alone. Port Newark is close to several oil refineries, a known al-Qaeda target. Path: This map shows the Ville D'Aquarius' movement since it left the United Arab Emirates on May 30. Watch video here.

Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and the Stargate SG1 homage, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time. In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, '12 Monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind. Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel. Unlike other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line. Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...Cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised. If that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much. If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. Bonus material on the DVD makes for very interesting viewing. Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'Munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. I would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting I've seen. It certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his \\"7½th\\" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. Watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. It's disturbing and distracting. Probably a coincidence, the Louis Armstrong song 'What a Wonderful World' was used at the end of both '12 Monkeys' and the final episode of the TV series of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Both the film and the TV series also featured British actor Simon Jones. '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain. It's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure. Now, what is this review like? Pick from:  A). negative.  B). positive.","output":"This review is B). positive. The person who wrote the review thinks that '12 Monkeys' is an excellent film that is entertaining and mentally stimulating.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What specific place did Leto claim the song City of Angels was about?, using the article: \\"City of Angels\\" is a synthrock song with influences and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and \\"gently burbling\\" synthesizers. It follows with the sounds of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, \\"Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / I found myself in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights\\". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming \\"I am home\\". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited \\"City of Angels\\" as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a \\"pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop\\".In a preview of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse acknowledged the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that \\"hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus.\\" Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to \\"Kings and Queens\\", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described \\"City of Angels\\" as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, \\"It's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land.\\" Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams.

Henry petitions to be admitted (fully aware of the kind of life he had led), but there is some doubt as to his qualifications. To prove his worthiness (or rather unworthiness), he begins to tell the story of his dissolute life.

His paternal grandmother (Clara Blandick in an uncredited role) is also doting and naive, although his down-to-earth grandfather Hugo Van Cleve (Charles Coburn), a self-made millionaire, understands Henry quite well. Henry grows up an idle young man, with a taste for attractive showgirls. One day, Henry overhears a beautiful woman lying to her mother on a public telephone. Intrigued, he follows her into a Brentano's and pretends to be an employee to get to know her better. Despite learning that she is engaged, he begins making advances, finally confessing he does not work there, whereupon she hastily departs.

Henry is shocked to find that his mystery woman and Martha are one and the same. It turns out that Albert was the first suitor of whom both her parents approved. Fearful of spending the rest of her life as a spinster in Kansas City, Martha agreed to marry him. Henry convinces her to elope with him instead. Though everyone (except Grandpa Van Cleve) is scandalized, eventually they are received back into the family. Henry and Martha enjoy a happy marriage and become the proud parents of a boy.

Step 1: Understanding Waltzing Matilda Waltzing Matilda is a popular Australian folk song written by Banjo Paterson in 1895, often referred to as Australia's unofficial national anthem. The song tells the story of a swagman (a traveling worker) who camps by a billabong (a small lake) and encounters a jumbuck.

One of the hippies is pregnant and is not taking part in the ritual; she sees Sylvia and drags her into the clearing, where Horace freaks out over the fact that their ritual has been observed. A more recent member of the group, Andy, admits that he met Sylvia in town and invited her along, prompting Horace to violently hit him. Sylvia becomes frightened and runs away, but two other members of the group chase after her and catch her in the woods, where they brutalize her.The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the small town's bakery. With Mildred is Pete, Sylvia's younger brother who appears to be about 12 or 13. Together, they take Sylvia back home to where she lives with Pete and their grandfather, Banner. Mildred is sure her boyfriend will know who victimized Sylvia--with the town deserted, the only other people in the area are the construction crew working on a dam near the town.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. By Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent, BBC News Reports of students having grades downgraded soon piled up, including bright pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds whose compelling personal stories quickly proved politically toxic. In the face of mounting pressure the government performed a wholesale U-turn, but not before some - including backbench Tory MPs - questioned what political damage was being done to a party that had pledged to 'level-up' across the country and prides itself on an ethos of \\"hard work pays off\\". Senior Labour figures certainly believe it has cost the Conservatives. On a visit to a London high school on Wednesday, shadow treasury minister Wes Streeting repeatedly claimed people were more angry about the exams episode than they were about Dominic Cummings' well-documented trip to Durham during lockdown, citing an inbox \\"inundated\\" with emails. Such assertions have been disputed by some Tory MPs, but one student present did say the handling of exam grades had influenced his political view. Tarun Odedra, 18, said: \\"I'm going to be a politics student, I've read so much into the government. I actually voted for them in the election. \\"It's completely made me change my mind as to what I think of them. If I do pursue a career in politics in the future, it most definitely won't be for the government that's in power right now.\\" It isn't only the Conservative Party which has struggled with grading in lieu of exams; Labour, the SNP, the DUP, Sinn Fein and even the Liberal Democrats have faced similar issues where they govern in the UK. But Labour, sensing a public backlash against the Westminster government, began a concentrated digital campaign. In the past week the party had 2,700 Facebook adverts running - more I'm told than in the entire 2019 general election campaign. They were designed to tap into anger the party says it picked up on social media among parents and young people, and were targeted specifically at marginal seats and former Labour strongholds that voted Tory last year - the so-called \\"former red wall\\". Rother Valley, in South Yorkshire, is a former mining community which voted Conservative in 2019. Its MP, Alexander Stafford, did raise concerns with ministers about the original grading system after receiving emails from teachers, constituents and pupils; one of a number of Tory backbenchers to do so. But he - like some of his colleagues - believes the government's U-turn was enough to take the sting out of the issue. He said: \\"What I'm hearing on the doorstep clearly, is that people understand the government has listened to people and wants to move on. \\"People appreciate this is a once in a generation global pandemic. We are all learning as we go along. And you know, it's great the government has listened to what people are saying, and no student is going to miss out after this.\\" A snapshot of views in South Yorkshire suggests opinion is divided. At the Vintage Booth, a tearoom in Maltby within the Rother Valley constituency, Mo Deeley, who voted Conservative in 2019 despite her Labour tradition, still has faith in the government. \\"I think they've done as good as they could possibly do. Yeah, they've made mistakes, but as good as they possibly could do in the situation that we're in. Nobody expected this in 2020, nobody.\\" Her colleague, Claire Mallory, has a similar view, saying: \\"It's very uncertain times and probably, you know the government has made mistakes. \\"But I think anybody who was in government would have made those mistakes because it was a whole brand new situation.\\" But not far away at Dinnington High, a local school, Principal Rebecca Staples fears the whole episode may have dented the confidence of some of the most disadvantaged students. She said: \\"We promised them that education would open them doors and give them choices for the future. \\"And actually, there was a real risk all of that was going to be stripped away and to even have a week of that worry is too much, because that's enough to shake people. \\"I think for all students, they will felt really let down by this, it will feel to them like a broken promise.\\" Output:","output":"The task asks you to generate a single-sentence summary of the given text, highlighting the main topic.

Please answer a question about the following article about Emotion: More contemporary views along the evolutionary psychology spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment. Current research[citation needed] suggests that emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand.

Article: It is reasonable to say that every teenager can be affected by peer pressure   at some point. Every day, in any high school, peer pressure has a major influence over the behavior of teenagers. It can be as subtle   as being persuaded to be late for class or as extreme as a dangerous drug. Whether subtle or extreme, peer pressure can have damaging, sometimes life changing, and even serious results. \\"Teens don't often consider the long-term results that some behavior can cause,\\" said Terri Price, a researcher. \\"Peer pressure can be very difficult to handle for many teens because of their fears of not fitting in\\". Peer pressure has always been part of teen life, but teens experience _ differently than their former generations did in the past. Sources of peer pressure have increased because of the Internet and other electronic communications. Recognizing peer pressure can be as simple as noticing that you have been asked to do something that you are not comfortable with. \\"Listen to your instinct   , which is a sign for whether something is right or wrong. If it feels wrong, then most likely it is. \\"says Price. Teens are in a time of life when they are still discovering who they are. Many teens are influenced by peer pressure because of their insecurities  . This can make them helpless especially when their self-control is weak or they lack healthy support, causing them to take risky behavior or turn to unhealthy support.

She won the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 with the song \\"La, la, la\\", beating the British pop singer Cliff Richard's \\"Congratulations\\".  - Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies.  - \\"Francoist Spain\\" (also historically \\"Nationalist Spain\\" during the Spanish Civil War) refers to the period of Spanish history between 1939, when Francisco Franco took control of Spain from the government of the Second Spanish Republic after winning the Civil War, and 1978, when the Spanish Constitution of 1978 went into effect. It is the opinion of several historians that during the Spanish Civil War, Franco's goal was to turn Spain into a totalitarian state like Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. However, its entry into the war on the Axis side was prevented largely by, as was much later revealed, British Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6) efforts that included up to 200 million in bribes for Spanish officials to keep the regime from getting involved. Franco was also able to take advantage of the resources of the Axis Powers and chose to avoid becoming heavily involved in the Second World War. Franco's regime evolved into a more classical autocratic regime.  - \`\` Marianne '' was the Italian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 , performed in Italian by Sergio Endrigo .

They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere. We will respond! ||||| NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Following an extensive discussion with President Trump today, Pfizer’s Chairman and CEO Ian Read announced that it will defer the company’s price increases that were effective on July 1 to give the president an opportunity to work on his blueprint to strengthen the healthcare system and provide more access for patients. The company will return these prices to their pre-July 1 levels as soon as technically possible, and the prices will remain in effect until the earlier of when the president’s blueprint goes into effect or the end of the year – whichever is sooner. In addition, the price declines the company took as of July 1 will remain in effect.      “Pfizer shares the President’s concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,” said Ian Read. “The most fundamental way the biopharmaceutical industry creates value is by discovering innovative medicines that help people live longer, healthier, more productive lives. We have entered an exciting new era with scientific advances that will result in future breakthroughs and cures. This highly complex and important work also generates hundreds of thousands of highly skilled jobs across the U.S. Furthermore we have recently committed 5 billion of capital to expand our manufacturing in the U.S. We are encouraged that the President recognizes the value our industry brings to society and our ability to fulfill our mission to discover and bring innovative new medicines to patients.”      View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180710006082/en/      Pfizer      Dean Mastrojohn, 212-733-6944      or      Sharon Castillo, 202-624-7524      Source: Pfizer ||||| When he found out that Pfizer had raised its prices on 100 drugs at the start of this month, President Donald Trump lashed out at the company for “taking advantage of the poor and others unable to defend themselves.”      His words, tweeted Monday, had a swift effect. The next day, Pfizer (pfe) did a u-turn—of sorts.      “Following an extensive discussion with President Trump today, Pfizer’s Chairman and CEO Ian Read announced that it will defer the company’s price increases that were effective on July 1 to give the president an opportunity to work on his blueprint to strengthen the healthcare system and provide more access for patients,” the company said in a statement.      The temporary price reversal will apply “until the earlier of when the president’s blueprint goes into effect or the end of the year,” Pfizer said.      The president is pleased.      Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients don’t pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2018      This is far from the first time Trump has publicly laid into a company. Frequent targets include Amazon and media outlets such as the Washington Post and New York Times, while he has also gone after defense contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and Pfizer rival Merck (again over high prices).      It is notable that the Republicans are generally seen as friendlier than the Democrats when it comes to drug pricing, though that seems to have changed under Trump. Pfizer’s Read has long defended the industry’s pricing practices.      The White House released Trump’s blueprint for tackling the issue in May. However, a lack of detail left many skeptical about the chances of seeing big pharma companies voluntarily reduce their prices. Of course, what Pfizer just did falls short of a full-scale reversal—and it remains to be seen what the blueprint would actually mean in practice. ||||| Quote One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.      A BURDEN ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: Drug prices are being driven up unfairly, taking a toll on the American people.      Excessively high drug prices, foreign freeloading, and a system rigged to reward list price increases, are burdening the American people. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States had the highest per-capita pharmaceutical spending in 2015.      Senior citizens pay more in Medicare Part B and Part D because government rules prevent health plans and vendors from negotiating the better deals seen in other markets.      Some hospitals that receive drug discounts under the 340B program, designed to help safety net facilities, do not provide meaningful levels of charity care to low-income and vulnerable patients, ultimately pushing up drug prices for patients with private health insurance.      Lower-cost drugs are kept out of the market by drug companies gaming regulatory processes and the patent system in order to unfairly maintain monopolies.      Lack of transparency in drug pricing benefits special interests and prevents patients from being able to make fully informed decisions about their care.      Other countries use socialized healthcare to command unfairly low prices from U.S. drug makers. This places the burden of financing drug development largely on American patients and taxpayers, subsidizes foreign consumers, and reduces innovation and the development of new treatments. The United States pays more than 70 percent of branded drug profits among OECD countries.            TAKING ACTION TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST: President Donald J. Trump’s blueprint includes new actions and proposals to drive down drug prices for all Americans.      President Trump’s blueprint will seek to encourage innovation, while also promoting better price competition and addressing foreign freeloading.      The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will: Take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies. Advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition. Evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition. Streamline and accelerate the approval process for over-the-counter drugs. Speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers. Avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid. Work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers. Examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program. Update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency. Prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance. Require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases. Work across the Administration to address intellectual property theft and foreign freeloading.      The President’s blueprint also seeks feedback about other potential actions, including: Reserving certain Part D incentives only for drug makers that stop raising prices. Ending Obamacare’s Medicaid rebate cap, which encourages higher drug prices. Including drug maker copay discount cards in Medicaid best price calculations. Making changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rules to remove barriers to innovation and competition. Reducing incentives to deliver Medicare Part B drugs in the most expensive setting. Requiring Pharmacy Benefit Managers to act in the best interests of patients. Paying for value in Medicare to spur development of drugs that cure illnesses rather than simply manage symptoms. Requiring beneficiaries to be told what their out-of-pocket costs will be prior to receiving a Part B drug or a Part D drug prescription, and whether lower-cost alternatives exist. Requiring “safety net” hospitals paid under Medicare Part B to use their 340B drug discounts to provide care to more low-income and vulnerable patients.      The U.S. Trade Representative will prioritize addressing unfair intellectual property and market access policies in our trade agreements, so that partners contribute their fair share to innovation.      The Administration will publish a comparison of drug prices in the United States with those in other OECD countries, to examine freeloading.      BUDGET PROPOSALS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES: The President’s blueprint includes proposals from his budget that would increase competition and reform Federal programs.      President Trump has proposed reforms to the Medicare Part D program, including: Allowing greater flexibility in benefit design to encourage better price negotiation. Offering free generics to low-income seniors. Requiring plans to share a minimum portion of drug rebates with patients. Discouraging plans from accelerating beneficiaries into the catastrophic phase of the benefit with costly brand name drugs. Protecting seniors from catastrophic costs through a new out-of-pocket maximum, while ensuring plans are incentivized to limit excessive costs.      Medicare Part B reforms proposed by the President would limit payment for price increases that are above the inflation rate and cut incentives for doctors to write high-price prescriptions.      Reforms would ensure hospitals paid under Medicare Part B that provide more than one percent of their patient costs in charity care could retain a discount under the 340B program.      The President has proposed actions to maximize competition and innovation, including curbing abuse of FDA safety rules and the 180-day “first-to-file” exclusivity clock.      BUILDING ON ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS: The blueprint will build upon actions President Trump’s Administration has already taken to increase competition and curb high drug prices.      FDA’s 2017 generic drug approvals contributed to prescription drug buyers saving 8.8 billion. These dramatic savings were driven in part because FDA set multiple approval records in 2017, including the most generic drugs approved in a year. FDA launched a new program to educate doctors about biosimilars. FDA issued new guidance to facilitate navigation of the generic drug approval process.      A recently finalized change to Medicare will save seniors an estimated 320 million in 2018 by reforming 340B drug payments.

He posted a tweet Tuesday evening saying he has spoken with both Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ian Read about the price increases. Trump praised Pfizer for \\"rolling back price hikes, so American patients don't pay more,\\" saying he \\"hopes other companies do the same.\\"      In a statement, the company confirmed the conversation, calling it extensive. Pfizer said it will return prices on dozens of the company's drugs to where they were before July 1 \\"as soon as technically possible.\\"      The company says they will remain there until the end of the year or when the president's blueprint for lowering prices goes into effect, whichever comes first.

Trump campaigned in 2016 on lowering the price of prescription drugs. He made his first move toward that end in early May when he released a nearly 40-page blueprint during a speech in the Rose Garden of the White House.      Pfizer says its decision is aimed at giving the president the opportunity to work on his proposals to lower prices. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

In a statement, Azar called the move \\"a step in the right direction and a major win for American patients.\\"      The president's plan to lower drug prices, which was detailed in May, is an initiative meant to fulfill a campaign promise. It seeks to increase competition among drug companies, have better government negotiations with pharmaceutical representatives, and to create incentives that would reduce patients' costs.      Critics, however, say the Trump administration is ignoring obvious leverage, mainly the prospect of using Medicare and its customer base of roughly 60 million to negotiate directly with the big pharmaceutical firms.      On June 12 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., expressed doubt that Trump could prod Big Pharma to lower prices within weeks, as he had promised at the end of May. A colleague and Warren surveyed 10 top drug makers and came away with zero commitment to the president's call for price drops, she said.      \\"He said there would be massive decreases in prices within two weeks,\\" Warren said. \\"It's been two weeks and there have been no decreases and an indication of increase.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to temporarily reverse its recent drug price increases following criticism from President Trump on Twitter.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. Question: Why does the author try Naked shampoos? Options: - Natural shampoos do not irritate his/her scalp   - not enough information   - Shampoos that have chemicals are bad   - They're aimed at damaged hair === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Natural shampoos do not irritate his/her scalp"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y.

Here's how you can approach this: 1. Understand the meanings of the words:    X: carp - a type of freshwater fish    Y: group - a number of people or things that are located, gathered, or classified together 2. Check for HYPER relationship:    Ask yourself if X is a specific instance of Y. In this case, is carp a specific instance of a group? The answer is no. So, the HYPER relationship does not apply here. 3. Check for COORD relationship:    Are both words part of the same semantic class? Meaning, do they belong to the same category or have a similar meaning? Carp is a type of fish, while group is a collective term for a number of things or people. They do not belong to the same semantic class. Therefore, the COORD relationship doesn't apply here either. 4. Since neither HYPER nor COORD relationships apply, the relationship between X and Y is RANDOM.

Today, we are going to tell you a really fun story about a school that did something super cool to find a place for their students to learn. Once upon a time, there was a primary school that had many students. The school was going to run out of space because they didn't have enough classrooms for everyone. They thought and thought about where they could put the new classrooms, but everything was already full. Then one day, someone had a bright idea. They found out that there was a private jet that wasn't being used anymore somewhere nearby. A private jet is a really small airplane that rich people use to go from place to place without having to share it with others. Now, this jet was just sitting around, gathering dust. The people at the school decided to turn this private jet into a brand-new classroom! That's right, they thought it would be a fun and different way to teach their students. The students were so excited to see their new classroom. It was not like any other classroom they had ever seen before. They even got to sit in the airplane seats and pretend they were going on a fun adventure. This new airplane classroom helped the school solve their problem of not having enough space. And as a bonus, it made learning more fun and interesting for the students. So, kids, remember this story next time you feel like there's no solution to a problem.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Even when one of the slaves dropped dead on the line the rest were forced to keep what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - being - working - alive - jumping - breathing  I believe the correct choice is \\"working\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"working.\\" The reason for this is rooted in the historical context of slavery and the brutal conditions that they faced. Slaves were treated as property, with little or no regard for their well-being or basic human rights. Their primary function was to perform tasks and generate profit for their owners, which often meant working under harsh conditions. As slaves were not viewed as individuals with rights and dignity, their lives were regarded as expendable. The focus was on maintaining maximum productivity, and this mindset allowed for the maltreatment and exploitation of slaves. If a slave dropped dead on the line—whether it was due to fatigue, illness, or injury—the others were forced to keep working, regardless of the emotional and physical toll it took on them. This inhumane practice was widespread not only within the United States, but also in other parts of the world where slavery and forced labor were prominent. Working conditions and environments varied, but the same underlying theme persisted: slaves were expected to work as long and hard as their owners dictated. Within the plantation system in the United States, for example, slaves worked tirelessly in various capacities, including planting and harvesting crops, tending livestock, and performing other manual labor tasks. Supervision methods varied, but often involved the use of an overseer who was responsible for maintaining discipline and ensuring that work was performed according to the owner's standards. Over time, as laws and regulations changed and a general shift in societal attitudes occurred, the practice of slavery was gradually dismantled and abolished. However, its impact and legacy still reverberate today, as descendants of slaves continue to face the systemic repercussions of this dark chapter in history. In conclusion, the correct answer is that slaves were forced to keep working even when one of their own dropped dead on the line. This practice revealed the dehumanizing nature of slavery and the complete disregard for the suffering of those who were considered property, rather than people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Weather has a strong effect  on people. It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\\"perfect weather\\"for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity . Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason. Question: In\\"perfect weather\\",  _  . Options: A: both the fat and the thin are healthy B: the students do very well in examinations C: the air pressure is low D: the humidity is 65 percent and the temperature is about 64F Answer:","output":"According to the details provided in the article, the \\"perfect weather\\" refers to a condition where the humidity is 65 percent and the temperature is about 64F. This condition is believed to elicit the best feelings in people regarding their overall well-being and ability to work. Hence, the correct answer to the question \\"In 'perfect weather'\\" is option D: the humidity is 65 percent and the temperature is about 64F. While options A, B, and C could logically be influenced by the weather, they do not accurately fill in the blank in context of the article's details on perfect weather. Option A, \\"both the fat and thin are healthy,\\" is an assumption not implied by the article. Weather affects our feelings and health but the text does not provide enough information to claim perfect weather leads to both fat and thin individuals becoming healthy.  Option B, \\"the students do very well in examinations\\", although a possible outcome of perfect weather, is not directly stated in the article. The article acknowledges weather can influence intelligence, specifically stating storms can boost intelligence and excessive heat can negatively affect it. Even so, there is no direct correlation stated between perfect weather and examination performance. Option C, \\"the air pressure is low,\\" does not align with the description of perfect weather in the article. It is true that low air pressure was discussed in relation to feelings of freedom and forgetfulness, but these conditions were not incorporated into the definition of perfect weather.  Therefore, once more, option D: \\"the humidity is 65 percent and the temperature is about 64F\\" is the correct answer.

And if you are experiencing that right now, I’m so sorry for you, but it gets better. Hear me out. I was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week. One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup. Now, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn’t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university. Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex). It was a bad experience to live through indeed, but it really changed me into a more stable, more productive person. In a way, I’m thankful to this girl for who I am today. Stay strong!

Well, just remember before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama, The FBI story. It traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). Chip was with the FBI from day one, and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world, even occasionally his family. The FBI Story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent, and how being one affects his personal life. The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. The audience gets to see Chip stop Ku Klux Klan riots, go undercover to solve an Indian murder/estate scandal, bring fugitives into custody, rescue hostages, and helped fight in WWII. He even helped bring Communist spies to justice. Stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much. One of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both Chip's family life and his job. We witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son. We also observe his wife having a miscarriage, and his marriage having rocky times. Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job. Vera Miles gives a spotty performance, but it's very convincing, none the less. She was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her. Well maybe that's just me? Sadly, none of the other performances are worth mentioning, but the attention-grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested. The cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungles. The colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the greatest part of this movie was Mervyn Leroy's fabulous direction. Every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story. It's chock full of ingenious camera shots, some with a very Hitchcockian feel. All in all, The FBI Story is a spectacular, but overlooked film. Clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated, but if you get the chance I recommend jumping into this one. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance, and the captivating story.

Article: It can be hard to encourage families of preschoolers to turn off the TV,but there are plenty of highquality shows that promote learning and positive relationships rather than violence,researchers noted. \\"Although clearly kids watch too much,what's more worrying is that they watch poor quality shows,\\" said Dr Christakis,the lead researcher on the new study from the University of Washington in Seattle.His former survey of parents of threeto fiveyearold children showed the kids often watched violent cartoons and movies that are \\"totally inappropriate\\". For their study,he and his colleagues randomly divide 565 preschoolers into two groups.In one group,parents recorded notes about kids' normal TV viewing,without receiving any guidelines to reduce or change those habits.In the other group,researchers made visits and calls and sent monthly newsletters encouraging parents to replace violent TV with educational programming.After six and 12 months,parents reported their kid's angry,aggressive or anxious behaviors on a questionnaire.At both time points,children in the TV intervention   program had slightly fewer problems than those in the comparison group.Boys in lowincome families seemed to benefit most from the change in programming,the researchers found. \\"The point is,this is something that is as effective as other things we do to try to guide behavior in children,and it's fairly simple,\\" Christakis said. Another study published in Pediatrics found the more TV kids and teens watched,the more likely they were to have a crime or other problems in society.Children may imitate violence they see--or more time in front of the TV could simply mean less communication with peers and families,and worse performance in school. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends kids watch no more than one to two hours of highquality programming each day.Researchers agreed parents should be mindful of what exactly their young kids are watching on TV as well.\\"It's  not just about turning the TV off,it's about changing the channel,\\"... Question: For Christakis,what is more concerning? Answer: A:","output":"TV shows being of poor quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve -597*x + 464 - 116 + 401 = -445 for x.. What is the answer??","output":"Sure, let me explain. Let's first simplify the equation. We have -597*x + 464 - 116 + 401 = -445. Let's add and subtract the numbers: 464 - 116 + 401 = 749. Now, we have -597*x + 749 = -445. Now, let's help you understand this better: Imagine, you have a toy train that can move forwards and backwards. You start at the 749th tree in a big park. The train moves backwards 597 times, and each time, it moves a certain distance (that's what \\"x\\" represents). Finally, after all those moves backwards, the train stops at the -445th tree. To find out the distance the train moves backwards each time (what \\"x\\" is), we can try to find how far the train moved between the 749th tree and the -445th tree.  To do this, let's see how many trees the train passed in total: 749 - (-445). When we subtract a negative number, it's the same as adding the positive of that number, so we add 749 + 445 = 1194 trees in total.  Now, we know that the train moved 1194 trees in 597 backward moves. To find the distance it moved during each backward move (the value of \\"x\\"), we just need to divide the total number of trees by the number of backward moves: 1194 trees ÷ 597 moves = 2 trees per move. So, x = 2, which means the train moved 2 trees backwards for each move it made."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of limited liability companies. Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack. The existence of serfdom was tackled boldly, taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees \\"for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,\\" and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected. This step had been followed by one even more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation. Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother Konstantin, Yakov Rostovtsev, and Nikolay Milyutin. On 3 March 1861, 6 years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.  Question: \\"What significant event followed after a petition by Polish landed proprietors was presented to Tsar Alexander?\\" Answer: \\"Alexander ordered his Minister of the Interior to send a message to the governors of European Russia praising the Polish landed proprietors idea to emancipate the serfs\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. After the petition was presented by the Polish landed proprietors regarding the regulation of their relations with serfs, Tsar Alexander authorized the formation of committees for the amelioration of the condition of the peasants. He also ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania.

Article: Drug discovery and development is very expensive; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards, who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries. In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year. This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. ‘Old Thailand’ Found on Sleepy Islands Under a blazing midday sun in late 2013, Allen Stewart surveyed the scene before him: The Gulf of Thailand, a spectrum of blues, stretched out as far as the eye could see. To the west, the jagged, emerald-hued peaks of Koh Chang emerged; the Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia rose to the east. Thick swaths of palm trees hugged empty white sand beaches below. “I looked around for years for something like this,” Mr. Stewart, 60, said of the heart-stopping view. “I grew up outside of Yellowstone — how do you match that? But when I saw this, it took about three seconds to say, ‘Yup, this is what we’ve been looking for.’ ” Mr. Stewart began sharing that affection in 2011, when he and his wife opened Thaidaho Vista, a guesthouse on petite Koh Mak island. And it’s that sort of impassioned search for tranquillity, beauty and an off-the-grid feel — for the “old Thailand,” one that’s fast disappearing — that’s luring entrepreneurs like Mr. Stewart and travelers to Koh Mak and its sister island of Koh Kut, an hour’s boat ride away, in the northeastern Gulf of Thailand, not far from the Cambodian border. The crowds of Thailand’s big-name beach destinations — Phuket, Koh Samui, Koh Chang — are worlds away from these palm-tree fringed, sleepy gems, where you’re more likely to encounter dogs and pigs sauntering along the road than traffic jams, and to have a stretch of sand and sea all to yourself, rather than elbow-to-elbow sun beds. “The party people come for one night and leave, because there’s nothing happening past 9 p.m.,” said one German tourist, Anja Doebbelin, 33, who first visited the island in 2010 and returned in late 2013. Of course, for a different sort of traveler, that sort of vibe makes it all the more appealing: That morning, Ms. Doebbelin had swum for an hour in crystal-clear water to the nearby island of Koh Rayang Nok, known for its snorkeling. A skate fish had been her sole companion, she said. “These are the sorts of amazing things you can do here,” she said while drinking a mango shake at Food Art Hut, an open-air restaurant under a thatched roof hung with tie-dyed lanterns. It’s typical of Koh Mak’s few businesses: small, family-run and low-key. Koh Mak isn’t just undiscovered by most tourists; that low-key quality is a deliberate decision on the part of the five families who own much of the island, descendants of Luang Prompakdii, an entrepreneur from a nearby province who purchased the six-square-mile island in the 19th century. Spooked by the unchecked development swallowing up Thailand’s once-pristine beaches, they’ve banded together to keep resorts small and the natural habitat intact as much as possible. Two dozen or so hotels dot the island’s shores, ranging from simple, 15-a-night bungalows to boutique properties like the Plub Pla, whose contemporary, chic villas are linked by raised wooden walkways. Warisara Ariyawongpreecha, a.k.a Leng, a Bangkok native with a broad smile, visited Koh Mak in 2008 while running a cooking school on popular Koh Chang, just 15 miles away. “Its most famous place is ‘Lonely Beach,’ but you’re never lonely there,” she said. Seduced by Koh Mak’s untarnished natural beauty and languor, she moved her business to the island, and now teaches the secrets of Thai cuisine at Koh Mak Smile, a waterfront cooking school where you can take in the sunset while enjoying the fruits of your labor. Another appeal, Ms. Ariyawongpreecha, 41, said, is that the island is home to plenty of native residents intent on responsible development. “The Koh Mak families send their children to school in Bangkok, but once they get there, they don’t like the pollution, the traffic, the noise,” she said. “They come back and appreciate what we have here.” And it’s easy to see why. A day out on two wheels along the island’s single-lane road shows just how blissfully little there is to do beyond swimming, sunning or simply gazing at the coconut groves and fields of swaying pastel-pink grasses populated by white ibises. (Bicycles and motorbikes are easily rented; just watch for animals snoozing in the middle of the road.) You might head out on a wooden dive-snorkel boat with Koh Mak Divers to see the schools of fish clad in psychedelic patterns that populate Koh Chang Marine National Park. You might stroll along the beach before a massage at the water’s edge. Of course, you’ll need to eat: At Koh Mak Seafood, you’re required to eat barefoot while savoring the amazing fresh seafood and water views. While Koh Mak’s manageable size lends it an easygoing, personable charm, Koh Kut, just a quick boat ride to the south, is its wild, majestic, staggeringly beautiful counterpart. Combining the two in one trip is highly recommended. At 40 square miles, Koh Kut is Thailand’s fourth-largest island, but remains nearly untouched. It’s reverie-inspiring attributes seem infinite: miles of undeveloped, white sand beaches hugging water the shade of turquoise that one dreams about on a cold winter day; tiered waterfalls hidden in a rain forest that’s home to ancient banyan trees said to have spiritual powers; pristine mangroves populated by fireflies that put on a light show every night. “The forest is clean, the water is clean. It is so pure here,” said Chompoonuch Deeprawat, a former general manager at Bann Makok the Getaway, a collection of fishermen’s homes turned into rustic-boutique accommodations by a group of friends from Bangkok's creative fields in 2010. During a late morning, guests lazed on Bann Makok’s wooden deck alongside a mangrove-lined river, swinging in hammocks, reading or heading out on kayaks for a break. “At night, the sky is full of stars, there are fireflies in the trees and stars in the water,” Ms. Deeprawat said of the phosphorescent plankton common to the surrounding waters. “Everything sparkles. It’s magical.” Koh Kut took its first, and, so far, biggest step onto the world travel scene in 2009 with the opening of the ultra-luxury Soneva Kiri resort, a brand known for taking up residence in the world’s most pristine locales. Since then, just a handful of boutique properties have opened. There’s talk of an airport, but development happens very slowly; the island currently doesn’t have adequate electricity or fresh water to support mass tourism. The expansive beach that stretches south of the Shantaa resort, for instance, has changed little since the 15-room family-run boutique property opened in 2005 on a coconut grove. And there’s little reason to leave this little piece of paradise. The service is excellent and the bungalows stylish, with white clapboard walls, outdoor baths and large porches for stargazing. Seasoned therapists deliver Thai massages at open-air wooden pavilions, and excellent local cuisine, like a crab and tamarind pad thai, is served at the restaurant, also alfresco. “We hope that Koh Kut will not become like other tourist islands,” said Yongwut Prugsanuwong, one of Shantaa’s owners. “We prefer gradual growth so the environment remains peaceful. We try to keep the pace at Shantaa as slow as possible, no matter how busy life outside becomes.” For now, Koh Kut’s abundance of natural bounty is as remarkable as the lack of consumer options. There are few restaurants to speak of, no souvenir shops, no traffic and just one or two rickety bars where you can watch the sky go orange and pink while sipping a cold Chang beer. (There are no organized tours, so travelers looking to explore the interior should be prepared to do so on their own.) Cassie and Mathew Bartley, London residents, spent four days honeymooning on Koh Kut. When they weren’t sunning themselves at the beach or sipping sauvignon blanc at sunset, they toured the island by motorbike and kayak, stopping at deserted beaches and clear lagoons. “There was absolutely no one around,” Mr. Bartley said of the kayaking. “There’s just something about all this space.” Rachael Birchenough, Soneva Kiri’s activities manager, agreed. An Englishwoman, she first came to Koh Kut to conduct a six-month staff training. Three years later, she’s still on the island, booking hotel guests on boat trips and visits to places like the Secret Waterfall, a three-tiered stunner recently made accessible by a new road. “When I came to Koh Kut, I felt as though I’d discovered a secret,” she said. “The job brought me here, but it’s the island that’s made me stay.” If You GoBoats to Koh Mak and Koh Kut (also spelled Koh Kood) depart from Trat, which can be reached from Bangkok by air (several flights a day on Bangkok Airways; from 2,550 baht, or about 80 at 32 baht to the dollar; bangkokair.com) or by land (four hours; from 3,500 baht for a private car with driver booked through your hotel).Boonsiri Catamaran (boonsiriferry.com) operates two boats a day from Trat’s Laem Sok pier with stops at Koh Mak and Koh Kutboth islands (from 400 baht).

These islands, far from the crowded beaches of Phuket, Koh Samui, and Koh Chang, are attracting entrepreneurs and travelers who prefer tranquility, beauty, and an off-the-grid feel. On Koh Mak, the low-key quality is a deliberate decision by the five families who own most of the island and aim to keep resorts small and the natural habitat intact. On Koh Kut, visitors can enjoy the white sand beaches, waterfalls, rain forests, and mangroves. There are few restaurants and shops, and currently, no organized tours, which allows travelers to explore the islands independently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review appears to be predominantly negative with a few positive aspects mentioned. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the experience, including the price, food quality, and slow service. However, they do acknowledge some positive features, such as the entertainment and pleasant waitresses. Breaking down the review, we can analyze each aspect mentioned: 1. Tourist trap: This conveys a negative sentiment, implying that the place primarily attracts tourists and may not provide an authentic or satisfactory experience. 2. Moderate prices but poor quality food: Again, this is negative, as the reviewer believes that the food quality does not match the price. 3. Comparison to Wendy's: The reviewer suggests that eating at a fast-food chain would have been a better option, which reflects a negative sentiment towards the establishment in question. 4. Entertainment in the front: This is a positive aspect of the reviewer's experience, indicating that they appreciated the provided entertainment. 5. Nice waitresses: This is another positive mention, as the reviewer found the waitresses to be friendly and welcoming. 6. Slow service: This is a negative sentiment, as the reviewer was not satisfied with the speed of service. Overall, the sentiment of this review leans more towards negativity, due to the dissatisfaction with the food quality, pricing, and service.

What is the answer?","output":"Cerulean, also known as cerulean blue, is an artist's color that falls within the blue spectrum. Its name originates from the Latin word \\"caeruleus,\\" which means sky blue, azure, or deep blue. The color cerulean is a medium-to-light, slightly muted, greenish-blue hue, with some variations leaning towards a more cyan or sky blue shade. Cerulean as an artist's color was initially created in the early 19th century by mixing cobalt stannate with cobalt oxide. It was later introduced as a genuine pigment into the creative industry in 1860, becoming favored by artists for its ability to create vivid and luminous skies, water, and other elements in their paintings. The cerulean color also appears in various forms, such as: 1. Cerulean blue, a classic shade, that is known to have a more traditional greenish-blue tone. 2. Cerulean blue hue, which is a modern mimicry of the original cerulean pigment using phthalocyanine blue instead of cobalt stannate. This replacement makes the color more affordable and generally safer for artists to use. 3. Cerulean chromium, which is a deep blue variant produced by combining cerulean blue with chromium oxide. Cerulean has been prominent in many art movements throughout history, especially in the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist periods. It allowed artists like Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh to achieve a newfound sense of freshness and vitality in their works' representation of the natural world. In conclusion, the artist's color called cerulean is a medium-to-light, slightly muted greenish-blue hue, originating from the Latin word \\"caeruleus.\\" Its unique color characteristics have made it a go-to choice for artists to bring out the vibrancy and luminosity in their paintings, particularly when depicting skies and bodies of water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many accidents happen because cars are now made to travel very fast. Also, people waste time and money every day as long lines of cars move slowly into towns and cities. In most big towns it is very hard to find parking spaces. Wide, smooth  , straight   roads must be built now in place of the old and narrow roads. These roads must not pass through towns and cities. They must not be crossed by other roads. Today such roads are being built  in many countries in the world. These roads have at least two lanes , one for slow-moving traffic and the other for fast-moving traffic. These roads do not pass through town and cities; horses and bikes are not allowed on them. Accidents do not usually happen. Cars can travel hundreds of miles without having to stop. But these modem roads often cannot be built in towns and cities. Before a road in a town can be made wider, many buildings have to be pulled down. Some people feel that more car-parks should be built outside a city, then the drivers should leave their cars and catch a bus or take a taxi to their offices.

Read this: For those that remained under the Ottoman Empire's millet system, religion was the defining characteristic of national groups (milletler), so the exonym \\"Greeks\\" (Rumlar from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the Orthodox Church, regardless of their language or ethnic origin. The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic. There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector, the Russian Empire, or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as Greek Muslims - excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme - were to be found in Crete (Cretan Turks), Greek Macedonia (for example among the Vallahades of western Macedonia), and among Pontic Greeks in the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan Selim the Grim, whose mother Gülbahar Hatun was a Pontic Greek. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What did it mean to be classified as a Greek by the millet command ?","output":"In simple terms, being classified as a Greek by the millet system meant that you were part of the Orthodox Christian group. This group was not based on language or where you were from, but on being part of the Orthodox Church. So, if you were an Orthodox Christian, the Ottoman Empire would call you a Greek, even if you spoke another language or came from a different place. This was because religion was the main way to group people together during that time. But remember, being part of this group also meant you were not treated as well as the Muslims in the Ottoman Empire."},{"instruction":"Who does the arrogant hunter want to marry?

Article: Smaller boats and ships typically have machine-guns or fast cannons, which can often be deadly to low-flying aircraft if linked to a radar-directed fire-control system radar-controlled cannon for point defence. Some vessels like Aegis cruisers are as much a threat to aircraft as any land-based air defence system. In general, naval vessels should be treated with respect by aircraft, however the reverse is equally true. Carrier battle groups are especially well defended, as not only do they typically consist of many vessels with heavy air defence armament but they are also able to launch fighter jets for combat air patrol overhead to intercept incoming airborne threats. Question: These weapons can be deadly to aircraft that is low if it is linked to what?","output":"These weapons, such as machine-guns or fast cannons, can be deadly to low-flying aircraft if they are linked to a radar-directed fire-control system. This system allows for greater accuracy and efficiency in targeting airborne threats by using radar technology to track and guide the weapon, making it more difficult for low-flying aircraft to evade or counterattack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: The National League Cy Young race is shaping up to be an interesting one, even though San Francisco's Tim Lincecum has been one of the leading candidates all season long. Lincecum could give his repeat candidacy a nice boost on Sunday when he faces the division-leading and arch-rival Los Angeles Dodgers. Lincecum only has 14 wins -- four behind the Cardinals' Adam Wainwright -- but he does lead the league in ERA at 2.30 and his 244 strikeouts lead the majors. He's also owned several of the Dodgers' best hitters during his career, as you can see below. A relatively low win total shouldn't keep Zack Greinke from winning the AL Cy Young Award, so even though Lincecum trails the Cardinals' Chris Carpenter in the latest USA TODAY Power Rankings, he could make a good case for being the front-runner with a vintage performance against the Dodgers.

Short review: Awful service, awful drinks. Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes. No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service.   Detailed review: The service is just plain awful. I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service. I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time. He never made eye contact or even bothered to acknowledge my presence the entire time I waited. When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously. When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life. I don't understand how someone could mess up a simple cocktail so badly - I even asked a few friends to try it to make sure I wasn't overreacting. Their disgusted looks after they each took a sip proved me right. My experiences at this place in the past were warning enough, but after this last visit I will never go back.

The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid.

St. Patrick's Street, the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s, is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare.

The General Post Office, with its limestone façade, is on Oliver Plunkett Street, on the site of the Theatre Royal which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840. The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850, which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877.

Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world.

In fact, some veterinarians and hedgehog breeders have recommended using only water to clean a hedgehog. If you decide to use shampoo, choose one that will not be harsh on your hedgehog’s skin.  Cat shampoo is a good choice for cleaning your hedgehog’s quills.  Tear-free baby shampoo is another good option.  Since hedgehogs are prone to dry skin, oatmeal shampoo would be a great choice. Oatmeal nourishes and moisturizes the skin. Look for a pet-specific oatmeal shampoo at your local pet store. Other than shampoo, you will need a soft-bristled toothbrush and a few clean hand towels. As an alternative to a toothbrush, you could use a human nailbrush.  The toothbrush or nailbrush are small enough to give your hedgehog’s quills a good cleaning. In addition, these items would protect your hands from getting pricked during cleaning. Make sure the toothbrush or nailbrush is dedicated to  only  cleaning your hedgehog.  Nailbrushes are available at your local pharmacy. If you are cleaning your hedgehog’s quills in a sink, you will also need a rubber stopper. Place your supplies by the bathing area (either the tub or sink) so you will have everything close by when you need it. Use lukewarm, not hot, water, to clean your hedgehog’s quills. Before filling the sink or tub, test the water temperature by running it over your hands. Once the water feels comfortably warm on your hands, fill the sink or tub with two to four inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of water.   Clean your sink or tub before adding the water. Be mindful that hedgehogs tend to urinate or defecate during bath time. If you are using a sink, choose one where you will not be preparing food.  Make sure to use shallow water only in your hedgehog's bath. If the hedgehog rolls up in deep water, then he may drown. After the bath, disinfect the sink or tub.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples?  Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango.  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content than fresh apples. The process of making candied fruit, as described in the paragraph, involves immersing the fruit or pieces of fruit in a heated sugar syrup. This sugar syrup absorbs the moisture within the fruit and preserves it. As a result, the fruit becomes saturated with sugar, making its sugar content significantly higher than that of fresh fruit. In the case of Dan's experiment, he candied plums, pears, ginger, and quince, which means that the sugar content of each of these items would be higher than that of the fresh apples he ate. The sugar content in fresh apples is naturally occurring, whereas the candied fruits have additional sugar from the preservation process. The high sugar content in candied ginger not only makes it sweeter but also helps prevent the growth of spoilage microorganisms. The unfavourable osmotic pressure created by the increased sugar content inhibits microbial growth, contributing to the fruit's extended shelf-life. In summary, due to the process of candying, which involves immersing ginger in a heated sugar syrup, candied ginger has a higher sugar content than fresh apples. This increased sugar content not only makes the candied ginger sweeter but also contributes to its preservation by creating an unfavorable environment for spoilage microorganisms, thus extending its shelf-life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact: plants are the source of fruit Question: Where is fruit made? What's the answer? Pick your answer from:  - in several farmers markets.  - in fruit bat caves.  - on the stems of trees or vines.  - in organic food stores.","output":"Fruit is made on the stems of trees or vines. This process begins with plants, which are the primary source of fruits. In the natural world, plants produce fruits as a means of reproductive structures, ultimately aiding in the dispersal of seeds which can lead to new plants growing in a different environment. As plants grow and mature, they utilize their leaves to photosynthesize sunlight, which is then converted into energy that fuels a range of other plant processes. The stems of trees and vines bear flowers which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Once the flowers have been pollinated, either through natural means like wind or insects, or through human intervention, they begin to transform into fruits. The ovary in the flower develops into the fruit, which encloses the seeds and protects them as they mature over time. Fruits come in various forms, including fleshy fruits such as apples, berries, and peaches, as well as dry fruits like nuts and capsules. The main purpose of producing fruits is to attract animals and other organisms that will eat the fruit, consequently dispersing the seeds contained within. This is a crucial aspect of a plant's reproductive cycle, leading to more diversity in plant populations, increased genetic variation, and aiding in plants' ability to thrive and adapt to changes in their environment. In short, the entire process of fruit development and maturation takes place on the stems of trees or vines, where plants have evolved to produce these edible structures as a method for protecting and dispersing their seeds. Fruit production is a complex and fascinating process that showcases the intricacies of plant reproduction, ensuring the continuation of healthy and diverse plant populations in the natural world. Only after these fruits have been produced on the plants are they then harvested and eventually sold in places such as farmers markets and organic food stores, where consumers can enjoy their taste and nutritional benefits."},{"instruction":"Find all numbers  N=overline{a_1a_2ldots a_n}  for which  9times overline{a_1a_2ldots a_n}=overline{a_nldots a_2a_1}  such that at most one of the digits  a_1,a_2,ldots ,a_n  is zero.","output":"1. Let ( N = overline{a_1a_2ldots a_n} ) be the number we are looking for, where ( overline{a_1a_2ldots a_n} ) represents the digits of ( N ). We need to find ( N ) such that ( 9N = overline{a_nldots a_2a_1} ), the reverse of ( N ). 2. Define ( r(N) ) as the reverse of ( N ). We are given that ( r(N) = 9N ). 3. First, consider the case where ( a_1 = 0 ). This would imply ( a_n = 0 ) because the reverse of ( N ) would also start with 0. Since at most one of the digits can be zero, ( n ) must be 1, and the only solution in this case is ( N = 0 ). 4. Now, consider the case where ( a_1 > 0 ). Since ( r(N) < 10^n ), we have:    [    9N < 10^n implies N < frac{10^n}{9}    ]    This implies ( N leq overline{111ldots 1} ) (with ( n ) ones). 5. Since ( N ) cannot be made of all ones (as it would not satisfy the condition ( 9N = r(N) )), there must be a zero after some leading ones. Let ( N = overline{1110ldots a_n} ) with exactly ( p ) leading ones. 6. The only value ( a_n ) such that ( 9a_n ) ends with ( a_1 = 1 ) is 9. Therefore, ( a_n = 9 ). 7. If ( p > 1 ), then ( a_2 = 1 ) and ( 9N ) must begin with 99. This implies ( N ) must end with 99, but then ( 9N ) ends with 91, which contradicts the fact that ( N ) begins with 11. Therefore, ( p = 1 ). 8. Thus, ( N ) begins with 10 and ( 9N ) ends with 01, and ( N ) ends with 89. We have:    [    9 times overline{10 b_1 ldots b_k 89} = overline{98 b_k ldots b_1 01}    ] 9. First, consider ( k = 0 ):    [    9 times 1089 = 9801    ]    This is a valid solution. 10. If ( k > 0 ), let ( x = overline{b_1 ldots b_k} ). We have:     [     9x + 8 = r(x) + 8 times 10^k     ]     This implies:     [     x geq frac{8 times 10^k - 8}{9} = overline{888ldots 8} text{ (with ( k ) eights)}     ]     Therefore, ( b_1 in {8, 9} ). 11. If ( b_1 = 8 ), then ( r(x) ) ends with 8, and ( r(x) + 8 times 10^k ) ends with 8. This implies ( 9x + 8 ) ends with 8, so ( x ) ends with 0, which is impossible since we already used the zero in ( N ). 12. Therefore, ( b_1 = 9 ). Then ( r(x) ) ends with 9, and ( 9x + 8 ) ends with 9, so ( x ) ends with 9.  13. By induction, ( x ) must be composed entirely of 9s. Thus, ( x = 9, 99, 999, ldots ). 14.

We need to prove that the points (C), (D), (E), and (F) are concyclic where line (SD) intersects (AB) at (E) and line (SC) intersects (AB) at (F). 1. **Identifying Tangent and Parallel Lines:**    - The tangent (T) at point (S) to the circle is parallel to the chord (AB). This is because (S) is the midpoint of the arc (AB).    - This parallel relationship allows us to transfer the angles involved through the use of alternate interior angles. 2. **Using Alternate Angles:**    - Consider the angle between the tangent at (S) and the line segment (SC). Let this angle be (alpha).    - By the property of alternate interior angles in parallel lines, (angle AFS = alpha) because the tangent at (S) is parallel to (AB). 3. **Theorem of the Angle to the Tangent:**    - According to the Tangent-Secant Theorem, the angle between the tangent and a chord through the point of tangency (in this case, angle (alpha)) is equal to the angle subtended by the chord opposite to the starting point of the tangent (angle (S D C)).    - Thus, we have (angle SDC = 180^circ - alpha). 4. **Equality of Angles:**    - Notice that (angle EDC) is part of a larger geometric structure involving the quadrilateral (CDEF).    - From the previous step, (angle SDC = angle EDC), as both involve the same secant and tangent relationships. 5. **Proving Concyclicity:**    - To prove that (C), (D), (E), and (F) are concyclic, we use the criterion that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to (180^circ).    - Thus, since (angle SDC = 180^circ - alpha) and (angle EFC = alpha), we have (angle EDC + angle FSC = 180^circ).

We need to find the sixth term. 1. The sum of the first 3 terms is given by S_{3} = 3a + 3d = 12, where a is the first term and d is the common difference. However, it's more common to express the sum of the first n terms as S_{n} = frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]. For n=3, this becomes S_{3} = frac{3}{2}[2a + 2d] = 12. Simplifying, we get 3a + 3d = 12. But the solution provided uses S_{3} = 3a_{2}, which seems to be a simplification or a mistake.

To find d, we subtract the equation a + 3d = 0 from a + d = 4: - a + d - (a + 3d) = 4 - 0 - -2d = 4 - d = -2 4.

Because the ( n )-gon is convex, the sequence of midpoints ( F_1, F_2, ldots, F_n ) will also form a convex ( n )-gon. 3. **Midpoints and Reflection Concept:**    If we fix one vertex, say ( A_1 ), then knowing ( A_1 ) and the midpoints ( F_i ), we can determine all vertices. Reflecting ( A_1 ) successively across each midpoint will generate the other vertices. Consequently, ( A_1 ) must be the fixed point of the composition of these reflections. 4. **Reflections and Translations:**    - An odd number of consecutive reflections yields a reflection about a single point (central symmetry). This point will be the centroid formed by ( F_1, F_2, ldots, F_n ).    - An even number of consecutive reflections results in a translation, which can be the identity transformation if the translation vector is zero. 5. **Considering ( n )-Polygons Based on Parity of ( n ):**    - **Odd ( n ):**      When ( n geq 3 ) is odd and the polygon ( F_1, F_2, ldots, F_n ) is regular, the point ( A_1 ) naturally aligns as the center of reflection through the sequential midpoints, suggesting that ( mathcal{K}_n ) must be regular as well.    - **Even ( n ):**      If ( n geq 4 ) is even, the centroid formed by reflecting through the midpoints will result in a translation identity because a regular polygon’s midpoints form a regular polygon whose sequential reflection is the identity transformation. 6. **Mathematical Derivation Using Vectors:**    - Let vectors for points be represented as ( mathbf{a}_1, mathbf{a}_2, ldots, mathbf{a}_n ).    - The midpoint vectors are:      [      mathbf{f}_i = frac{mathbf{a}_i + mathbf{a}_{i+1}}{2}      ]      for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ).    - Manipulating equations for ( mathbf{f}_i ), multiplying alternate equations by ( -1 ), and summing, we derive:      [      mathbf{f}_1 - mathbf{f}_2 + mathbf{f}_3 - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} mathbf{f}_n = begin{cases} mathbf{a}_1, & text{if } n text{ is odd}  mathbf{0}, & text{if } n text{ is even} end{cases}      ]      This indicates the conditions for ( mathbf{a}_1 ). 7. **Conclusion:**    The statement is true for natural numbers ( n ) such that ( n ) is an odd number greater than 1.

By definition, for any given point P(x, y) on the terminal side of an angle located in standard position, the sine of the angle is the y-coordinate of the point divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the x-axis, the y-axis, and the line segment from the origin to P. First, we calculate the length of the hypotenuse, which can be considered as the radius r of a circle centered at the origin that passes through the point P. The hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: r = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{1 + 4} = sqrt{5}. Since sinalpha = the y-coordinate of the point P divided by the hypotenuse r, we get: sinalpha = frac{y}{r} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}}. However, this value is not the final answer, because we must also consider the quadrant where the terminal side is located. Given that the x-coordinate of P is negative and the y-coordinate of P is positive, the terminal side of angle alpha lies in the second quadrant. In this quadrant, the sine function is positive. Therefore, the value of sinalpha remains frac{2}{sqrt{5}}, and this is our final simplified answer in terms of square roots.

Thus:      [      a_1 + 2a_2 = a_1 + 2a_3 = a_1 + 2a_4      ]    - This implies:      [      2a_2 = 2a_3 = 2a_4      ]      [      a_2 = a_3 = a_4      ]      - Similarly, analyzing exsphere (S_2) gives:        [        a_1 = a_3 = a_4        ] 5. **Conclusion**:    - From (a_2 = a_3 = a_4) and (a_1 = a_3 = a_4), we conclude that (a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4). Since all (a_i) are equal, all edges (A_iA_j) are equal, which means the tetrahedron (A_1A_2A_3A_4) is regular.

Let's start by adding 357 to 210: 210 + 357 = 567 (not a multiple of 10000) We can keep adding 357 until we find a suitable number: 567 + 357 = 924 924 + 357 = 1281 1281 + 357 = 1638 1638 + 357 = 1995 1995 + 357 = 2352 2352 + 357 = 2709 2709 + 357 = 3066 3066 + 357 = 3423 3423 + 357 = 3780 3780 + 357 = 4137 4137 + 357 = 4494 4494 + 357 = 4851 4851 + 357 = 5208 5208 + 357 = 5565 5565 + 357 = 5922 5922 + 357 = 6279 6279 + 357 = 6636 6636 + 357 = 6993 6993 + 357 = 7350 7350 + 357 = 7707 7707 + 357 = 8064 8064 + 357 = 8421 8421 + 357 = 8778 8778 + 357 = 9135 9135 + 357 = 9492 9492 + 357 = 9849 9849 + 357 = 10206 10206 + 357 = 10563 10563 + 357 = 10920 10920 + 357 = 11277 11277 + 357 = 11634 11634 + 357 = 11991 11991 + 357 = 12348 12348 + 357 = 12705 12705 + 357 = 13062 13062 + 357 = 13419 13419 + 357 = 13776 13776 + 357 = 14133 14133 + 357 = 14490 14490 + 357 = 14847 14847 + 357 = 15204 15204 + 357 = 15561 15561 + 357 = 15918 15918 + 357 = 16275 16275 + 357 = 16632 16632 + 357 = 16989 16989 + 357 = 17346 17346 + 357 = 17703 17703 + 357 = 18060 18060 + 357 = 18417 18417 + 357 = 18774 18774 + 357 = 19131 19131 + 357 = 19488 19488 + 357 = 19845 19845 + 357 = 20202 20202 + 357 = 20559 20559 + 357 = 20916 20916 + 357 = 21273 21273 + 357 = 21630 21630 + 357 = 21987 21987 + 357 = 22344 22344 + 357 = 22701 22701 + 357 = 23058 23058 + 357 = 23415 23415 + 357 = 23772 23772 + 357 = 24129 24129 + 357 = 24486 24486 + 357 = 24843 24843 + 357 = 25200 We have found a number that ends with \\"0000\\" when we add 357 to 210 repeatedly. The number is 25200, which is a multiple of 10000 and can be represented by AB * 10000. Therefore, AB = 25 and B = 5.

This leads to:    [    y_1 text{ and } z_1 text{ are divisible by } p,    ]    which contradicts (text{gcd}(x_1, y_1, z_1) = 1). Hence, ((x_1 - y_1)) and ((x_1 - z_1)) must be coprime. 5. **Conclusion for coprime factors:**    Since ((x_1 - y_1)) and ((x_1 - z_1)) are coprime and their product results in a perfect square, both ((x_1 - y_1)) and ((x_1 - z_1)) must individually be perfect squares.  6. **Final step:**    This implies that (y_1 - x_1) is a perfect square. Consequently, we conclude that (d^4(y_1 - x_1)) is also a perfect square. Hence:    [    text{gcd}(x, y, z) cdot (y - x)    ]    is a perfect square.

A knight's move shifts a piece two squares in one direction and one in a perpendicular direction, i.e., an L-shape. 1. Since the rooks do not threaten each other, each row and column will contain exactly one rook. 2. Let's denote the rooks' positions as ((i, j_i)) where (i) is the row index and (j_i) is the column index of the rook in row (i). **Rows:** 3. Consider every pair of rows:    - Swapping the rook in the first row ((1, j_1)) with the rook in the second row ((2, j_2)).    - Similarly, swap ((3, j_3)) with ((4, j_4)), continuing this way until we reach the last pair ((7, j_7)) and ((8, j_8)).    - This ensures each rook moves to a new row while maintaining the same column. **Columns:** 4.

Since each box holds one ball, this is a permutation problem and we have 3! ways to arrange 3 balls:  text{Number of ways to arrange 3 balls in 3 boxes} = 3! = 6  The product of the two calculations gives us the total number of fundamental events:  text{Total number of fundamental events} = 10 times 6 = 60  Next, determine the number of events where neither D nor E is in any of the boxes. Since we have 3 other balls A, B, and C, the number of ways to choose and place them without considering D and E is just the product of ways to choose 3 out of 3 and arranging them in 3 boxes, which is actually 1 times 3! = 6. Now, the probability of the complementary event where neither D nor E is selected is:  P(text{neither D nor E}) = frac{text{Number of events where neither D nor E is in the boxes}}{text{Total number of fundamental events}} = frac{6}{60} = frac{1}{10}  To find the probability that either D or E is in a box, we subtract the complementary probability from 1:  P(text{D or E in a box}) = 1 - P(text{neither D nor E})  Substitute the value we found for the complementary event:  P(text{D or E in a box}) = 1 - frac{1}{10} = frac{9}{10}  Therefore, the probability that either ball D or E is placed in a box is boxed{frac{9}{10}}."},{"instruction":"Two trains of lengths 156.62 and 100 meters are running on parallel lines with respective speeds of 30 km/hr and 36 km/hr. How long does it take for them to cross each other if they run in the opposite direction?","output":"When two trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.  First, we need to convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s because the lengths of the trains are given in meters.  To convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hr). Speed of first train in m/s = 30 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) = 30 * 1000 / 3600 = 8.33 m/s (approximately) Speed of second train in m/s = 36 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) = 36 * 1000 / 3600 = 10 m/s Now, we add the speeds to get the relative speed: Relative speed = 8.33 m/s + 10 m/s = 18.33 m/s The total length of the trains that needs to be crossed is the sum of their lengths: Total length = 156.62 m + 100 m = 256.62 m Now, we can find the time it takes for them to cross each other by dividing the total length by the relative speed: Time = Total length / Relative speed = 256.62 m / 18.33 m/s ≈ 14.01 seconds So, it takes approximately boxed{14.01}  seconds for the two trains to cross each other when running in opposite directions."},{"instruction":"A number when divided by some value leaves 75 as remainder. When the same number is divided by 37, the remainder is 1. What is the value that the number is divided by to get a remainder of 75?","output":"Let's denote the number as ( N ) and the value by which it is divided to leave a remainder of 75 as ( D ). From the information given, we can write two equations: 1. When ( N ) is divided by ( D ), the remainder is 75: [ N = D cdot q_1 + 75 ] where ( q_1 ) is the quotient of the division. 2. When ( N ) is divided by 37, the remainder is 1: [ N = 37 cdot q_2 + 1 ] where ( q_2 ) is the quotient of the division. Since both equations equal ( N ), we can set them equal to each other: [ D cdot q_1 + 75 = 37 cdot q_2 + 1 ] We can rearrange the equation to solve for ( D ): [ D cdot q_1 = 37 cdot q_2 + 1 - 75 ] [ D cdot q_1 = 37 cdot q_2 - 74 ] Now, we know that ( D ) must be greater than 75 because the remainder when dividing by ( D ) is 75. Also, ( D ) must be a multiple of 37 plus 38 because when ( N ) is divided by 37, the remainder is 1, which means ( N ) is 1 more than a multiple of 37. So, ( D ) must be in the form of ( 37k + 38 ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer, and ( D > 75 ). The smallest value of ( k ) that makes ( D > 75 ) is 2 because: [ D = 37 cdot 2 + 38 = 74 + 38 = 112 ] Therefore, the smallest possible value for ( D ) that satisfies the conditions is boxed{112} . However, there could be larger values of ( D ) that also satisfy the conditions. To find the exact value of ( D ), we would need more information about the number ( N ) or the quotients ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 )."},{"instruction":"What is the sum of all twodigit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 25?","output":"Let n = 10a + b be a two-digit number.

As the digits must be in increasing order, this can be seen as choosing 8 digits (with strict order and repetition not allowed) from the 6 available digits (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). The number of ways to do this equals the number of ways to choose 8 digits from 6, which can be calculated using combinations: Since choosing 8 digits from 6 is not possible, consider the possibility that the problem statement is misunderstood and it should be choosing any number of digits up to 8, but at least one from each of 3 through 8. This implies choosing 8 digits from the 6 different choices, possibly repeating some digits. Since we need each digit at least once, this transforms into choosing 2 additional digits from these 6 after the first 6 unique digits are used. This scenario utilizes the stars and bars theorem: 1. Each of the digits 3 through 8 must appear at least once, so we initially place one digit in each slot for these 6 digits. 2. We then have 2 additional digits to place, and there are 6 possible choices for each. Using stars and bars, where we have 2 stars (additional digits) and 5 bars (dividers for 6 digit types): [ {2 + 5 choose 5} = {7 choose 5} = 21 ] Thus, the remainder of M when divided by 1000 is: [ boxed{021} ]"},{"instruction":"Quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle with segment AC a diameter of the circle.

Since angle DAC = 15^circ and angle BAC = 60^circ, angle DBA must be 180^circ - 15^circ - 60^circ = 105^circ. Using properties of inscribed angles: - angle B and angle D are subtended by diameter AC, so both are right angles (90 degrees). For triangle DAC, using a 15-75-90 triangle: - Side length of CD is cos(15^circ) cdot AC = cos(15^circ) cdot 2r. - Side length of AD is sin(15^circ) cdot AC = sin(15^circ) cdot 2r.

For (Q(x)), we have:    [    Q(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k    ]    This sum is a geometric series which can be rewritten as:    [    Q(x) = frac{1 - x^n}{1 - x} quad text{for} quad x neq 1    ]    For (P(x)), since the exponents are even, we have:    [    P(x) = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{2j}    ]    This sum is another geometric series written as:    [    P(x) = frac{1 - x^{2n}}{1 - x^2} quad text{for} quad x neq 1, -1    ] 2. **Forming the Division**:    The goal is to determine whether ( P(x) ) is divisible by ( Q(x) ).

To find the digit in the 12^1 (twelve's) place, determine the largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 153. We find that 12 times 12 = 144 is the largest, so the coefficient for 12^1 is 12, but in base 12, we use A to represent 10 and B to represent 11. So, the digit for 12^1 is B because 144/12 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11 = B in base 12. 2. The digit in the 12^0 (one's) place is 153 - 144 = 9.

In the Cartesian coordinate plane, the transformation of a graph is equivalent to the transformation of any point on the graph. The rules for point transformation are: for horizontal coordinates, add when moving left and subtract when moving right; for vertical coordinates, add when moving up and subtract when moving down. Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. Identify the given transformation: The line is translated 1 unit to the left and 2 units up. 2. Apply the transformation rules to the equation: For the horizontal shift, we add 1 to the x value because we are moving to the left. For the vertical shift, we add 2 to the y value because we are moving up. Therefore, the new equation becomes y - 2 = -2(x + 1). 3. Simplify the equation: Distribute the -2 on the right side of the equation to get y - 2 = -2x - 2. Finally, add 2 to both sides of the equation to obtain y = -2x - 2.

Let’s denote it by ( B = A - 111 ).    - The digits of ( B ) are obtained by subtracting or carrying digit-wise, starting from the least significant digit of ( A ).    - To maintain digits in descending order after subtraction, ( B ) must have lower or equal digits than ( A ) in each positional place, preserving the order.    - Because ( A ) is in descending order and each digit subtraction affects in place, the order of the digits in ( B ) will still be non-ascending.    - Thus, ( B ) also has digits in descending order.    - Additionally, since ( A ) is a multiple of 111, subtracting 111 means ( B ) is still a multiple of 111 (As multiples of 111 subtracted by 111 result in another multiple of 111).    - Therefore, ( B ) is smaller than ( A ) and still a multiple of 111 with digits in descending order.    - This contradiction arises as ( A ) is supposed to be the smallest. 4. **Conclusion**:    - Neither case 1 nor case 2 supports the existence of such a number definitively.    - Therefore, it is concluded that there does not exist a number whose digits are arranged in descending order and is a multiple of 111.

Let ( M ) be the midpoint of the hypotenuse ( AB ), and let ( K ) be the point on the leg ( AC ) such that ( K M perp AB ).     ![Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/150) 2. Since ( M ) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, by the Midpoint Theorem, ( CM = MB = MA = frac{1}{2} AB ). 3. Notice that triangle ( ABC ) is a 30-60-90 triangle. For ( A = 30^circ ), the relationship between the sides in a 30-60-90 triangle is: [      AC = AB cdot sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} AB  ] and [      BC = AB cdot cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} AB  ] 4. The segment ( CM ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) at point ( M ) and we have ( CM = frac{1}{2} AB ). 5. Since ( CM ) is the height from the right angle to the hypotenuse, in triangle ( C M K ), we use the property of a 30-60-90 triangle that ( M ) forms. The angle ( angle MBC ) is ( 60^circ ) and therefore, the triangle ( CMK ) becomes an equilateral triangle. 6. Because ( CMK ) is equilateral, ( CM = MK = CK ).

It turned out that two of the five new sequences are arithmetic progressions with common differences of 4 and 36, respectively, and one of the sequences is a geometric progression. Find the largest of the given 8 numbers. Mention all possible options.","output":"To solve this problem, let's denote the sequence of 8 increasing real numbers as (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8). We are given some conditions regarding these sequences: 1. There are two arithmetic progressions (AP) among the sequences of 4 consecutive numbers, with common differences of 4 and 36. 2. There is also one geometric progression (GP) among the sequences of 4 consecutive numbers. Our goal is to find all possible values for the largest of these 8 numbers. 1. **Finding the Overlapping Elements**:    Let's assume there are three numbers (a), (b), and (c) which form both an arithmetic and a geometric progression:        - Arithmetic progression condition: (b - a = c - b), which implies (2b = a + c).    - Geometric progression condition: (frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{b}), which implies (b^2 = ac).    Solving these equations simultaneously:        [    2b = a + c quad text{and} quad b^2 = ac.    ]        Substitute (a + c = 2b) into the second equation:        [    b^2 = a cdot (2b - a) = 2ab - a^2,    ]        simplifying yields:        [    b^2 - 2ab + a^2 = 0 implies (b - a)^2 = 0 implies b = a.    ]        If (b = a), then (c = a) also holds true. However, since a progression with zero difference (a = b = c) is not allowed in an arithmetic progression unless the numbers are equal, this contradicts the requirement for non-zero common differences. 2. **Separated Elements in Progressions**:    The arithmetic and geometric progressions must span distinct segments.        Let's consider the sequences:    **Case 1:**    - First 4 numbers are an AP with common difference 4.    - Central 4 numbers form a GP.    - Last 4 numbers form an AP with common difference 36.    Assume the sequences as follows:        (    a_3 = a, quad a_4 = a + 4, quad a_5 = b, quad a_6 = b + 36    ),    Since the central 4 form a GP:        [    frac{a + 4}{a} = frac{b}{a + 4} = frac{b + 36}{b}.    ]        Solving (frac{a+4}{a} = frac{b}{a+4}), we find:        [    (a+4)^2 = ab implies b = frac{(a+4)^2}{a}.    ]        Next, solve (frac{b+36}{b} = frac{b}{a+4}):        [    b(b + 36) = a + 4b implies b^2 + 36b = a+4 quad (text{and substituting } b = 9a),    ]        Results in:        [    b = 9a.    ]        Substitute (b = 9a) into previous equation:        [    8a^2 - 8a - 16 = 0,    ]        solving for (a):        [    a = -1 text{ or } a = 2.    ]    Checking (a = -1) returns sequence ([-9, -5, -1, 3, -9, 27, 63, 99]) which does not increase.         Checking (a = 2) returns sequence ([ -6,  -2, 2, 6, 18, 54, 90, 126 ]) which fulfills the conditions. 3. **Revising Other Case**:    - Assume different combinations for increasing order and other arithmetic sequences.        Upon evaluating, the other possibilities also restrictively generate non-increasing or non-valid progressions. Ultimately, the central sequences tested and validate the two valid results: - Results:   Highest value in first valid sequence gives (126).

The angle can start from 0 (inclusive) when the line is horizontal and increase up to but not include pi radians (or 180^{circ}), as a line with a slope angle of pi would be vertical, and vertical lines are considered to have an undefined slope, not a slope angle of pi. **Statement B**: If the slope of a straight line is tan alpha, then the slope angle of the line is alpha. - This statement is not entirely correct because the slope angle alpha corresponding to a slope of tan alpha must be in the interval [0, pi) for the slope to be defined. However, the tangent function repeats every pi radians, meaning that for every slope tan alpha, there are infinitely many angles that have the same tangent value. The correct slope angle is the one that corresponds to the direction in which the line actually goes, which must be in the interval [0, pi). **Statement C**: Any straight line in the Cartesian coordinate system has a slope angle, but not necessarily a slope. - This statement is correct because every line has a direction, and thus a slope angle can be associated with it. However, vertical lines, which are perpendicular to the x-axis, have an undefined slope because their change in x is 0, which would lead to division by zero in the slope formula. The slope angle of a vertical line is 90^{circ} or frac{pi}{2} radians. **Statement D**: The greater the slope angle of a straight line, the greater its slope. - This statement is incorrect because the relationship between the slope angle and the slope is not linear. When the slope angle is acute (0 < alpha < frac{pi}{2}), the slope is positive and increases as the angle increases. However, once the slope angle exceeds frac{pi}{2} (becomes obtuse), the slope becomes negative. Therefore, an increase in the slope angle beyond frac{pi}{2} leads to a decrease in the value of the slope (considering the slope as a positive or negative value, not its absolute value).

Furthermore, the assumption (y = -x) leads to (2x^2 = 1), which is impossible as it doesn't yield integer solutions. Therefore, we must have (x + y > 0).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get: [3^{2s}(3u^2 - v^2) = 3^{3^s (u+v)}.] Since the left side is divisible by (3^{2s}) but not by (3^{2s+1}), and the right side is divisible by (3^{3^s(u+v)}) but not by (3^{3^s(u+v)+1}), we must have the equality of powers: [2s = 3^s(u+v).] Given (u+v > 0), we know (3^s > 2s) (since ((1 + 2)^s = 1 + 2s + cdots > 2s)). Therefore, this scenario is impossible. # Case 2: (x) divisible by (3^{s}), (y) divisible by (3^{s+1}) Let (x = 3^s u) and (y = 3^{s+1}v), where (s, u,) and (v) are integers, (s geq 0), and (u) is not divisible by 3. Substituting these into the original equation: [3^{2s+1}(u^2 - 3v^2) = 3^{3^s(u + 3v)}.] The left side is divisible by (3^{2s+1}) but not by (3^{2s+2}), and the right side is divisible by (3^{3^s(u + 3v)}) but not by (3^{3^s(u + 3v) + 1}).

Step 1: Calculation of (sin frac{theta}{2}) 1. We begin with the formula that relates the sine of half-angle (frac{theta}{2}) to the radii of the circles. The sine of half the angle between the external tangents can be expressed as: [ sin frac{theta}{2} = frac{R - r}{R + r} ] This can be understood from the right triangle formed by radii of the two circles and the segment joining the points where the tangents touch the circles.

When x is divided by 14, the remainder is 11. What is the remainder when x is divided by 84?","output":"Let's denote the remainder when x is divided by 84 as R. Since x leaves a remainder of 11 when divided by 14, we can express x as: x = 14k + 11 where k is some integer. Now, we know that 84 is a multiple of 14 (84 = 14 * 6). Since x leaves a remainder of 11 when divided by 14, it means that when x is divided by 84, it will also leave a remainder that is a multiple of 14 plus 11, because 84 is a multiple of 14. To find the remainder R when x is divided by 84, we need to find a multiple of 14 that is less than 84 and then add 11 to it. The largest multiple of 14 less than 84 is 70 (14 * 5 = 70).

Subtract the value of the thousandth digit from the total desired sum: 16 - 9 = 7. This leaves us with 7 to be distributed among the remaining three digits. 3. To keep the number as large as possible, we assign the largest possible value to the next significant digit, the hundredth place. Since we have 7 left and we need to distribute it among three digits, the largest value we can assign to the hundredth place without exceeding our total is 7 itself. 4.

Assume that it is not possible to choose a column such that after changing all squares in this column to white, any two rows are still not completely identical. 2. **Graph Representation:**    Let ( A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n} ) represent the rows of the ( n times n ) chessboard. If after changing column (i) to white, any two rows (A_j) and (A_k) become identical, we draw an edge between vertices (A_j) and (A_k) and label this edge with the column number (i). If two or more pairs of rows become identical, we will consider any one pair. 3. **Construct the Graph:**    Construct a graph where the vertices are ( A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n} ) and edges are drawn as described above with labels corresponding to the column numbers. This graph will have ( n ) vertices and ( n ) edges (one for each column). 4. **Graph Theory Insight:**    By theory of graphs, a graph with ( n ) vertices and ( n ) edges must contain at least one cycle. Assume this cycle is ( A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, cdots, A_{i_k}, A_{i_1} ) where the edges have labels ( j_1, j_2, cdots, j_k ) respectively. 5. **Label Mismatch:**    Assume ( A_{i_1} ) and ( A_{i_2} ) rows become identical after making column ( j ) white but the small square in the ( j )-th column of rows ( A_{i_1} ) and ( A_{i_2} ) is different in color (since we had the same color constraint initially). 6. **Contradiction Identification:**    If two rows (A_{i1}) and (A_{i2}) are connected by an edge labeled (j) after making column (j) white, it means that their other small squares are already identical elsewhere, specifically for column (j). This leads to a contradiction because, due to the condition that any two rows are not completely identical before the alteration, such a cycle should not exist. 7. **Conclusion:**    As we find a contradiction, our initial assumption that no such column could be chosen must be incorrect. Thus, there must exist a column such that upon making all its squares white, we still have no pair of rows completely identical.
