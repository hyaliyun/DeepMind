Here are some of the reasons why this approach could be beneficial: 1. **Flexibility**: A mutual agreement can offer more flexibility in determining the amount and schedule of payments, allowing both parties to come to terms that consider the payer's financial situation and the child's needs more carefully than a court-ordered arrangement might. 2. **Reduced Conflict**: Working together to come to an agreement can reduce potential conflict and promote a more cooperative co-parenting relationship. This approach fosters communication and compromise, which can be ultimately beneficial for the child. 3. **Cost Savings**: Legal processes involved in establishing child support through the courts can be expensive for both parties. Mutual agreements can eliminate or significantly reduce attorney fees, court costs, and the time investment required for court appearances. 4. **Privacy**: Handling child support arrangements privately can keep personal and financial matters out of the public record, which some parents prefer. 5. **Avoidance of Penalties**: The state can impose penalties for late or missed child support payments, including garnishing wages, seizing tax refunds, suspending driver's licenses, and more. A mutual agreement can allow for more understanding and leeway in case of financial hardships, reducing the risk of these penalties. 6. **Speed and Simplicity**: Reaching an agreement outside of court can be much faster than the process of obtaining a court-ordered child support arrangement. This can be particularly beneficial if both parties wish to resolve the matter quickly and without the formality of court procedures. 7. **Tailored to Changing Conditions**: Parents can agree to adjust the terms of support more easily in response to changing financial circumstances or the child's evolving needs without needing to go through formal legal processes to request modifications. 8. **Increased Compliance**: Parents may be more likely to comply with the terms of an agreement they've directly contributed to and agreed upon, rather than feeling compelled by a court order. This increased commitment can ensure more consistent support for the child. While mutual agreements on child support can offer these benefits, it's crucial for both parties to document the terms clearly and consider seeking legal counsel to draft a formal agreement. This ensures that the agreement is fair, clearly understood, and can be enforceable, protecting the interests of the child, the payer, and the recipient."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message is incomplete. Could you provide more details or ask a specific question? I'm here to help!"},{"instruction":"list more reasons","output":"Certainly! Expanding on the initial reasons why a mutual agreement on child support, not involving the state, can be beneficial to the parent paying, here are additional considerations: 9. **Direct Communication**: A mutual agreement encourages open and direct communication between parents regarding their child's needs and financial matters. This can lead to better understanding and cooperation in other aspects of co-parenting. 10. **Customizable Arrangements**: Parents can include clauses that might not typically be considered in a court-ordered support plan. For example, they can agree on sharing costs of extracurricular activities, college tuition, or medical expenses in a more nuanced way than a standard order might allow. 11. **Quick Adaptation to Changes**: Life circumstances can change (e.g., job loss, relocation, or health issues). Mutual agreements can be more swiftly adjusted to accommodate such changes, provided both parties are in agreement, without waiting for court dates or legal processes. 12. **Reduced Stress and Anxiety**: Legal proceedings can be stressful and intimidating. By avoiding court, parents might reduce the emotional and psychological toll associated with these processes, focusing instead on a constructive dialogue about their child’s welfare. 13. **Moral Satisfaction and Autonomy**: There is a level of moral satisfaction and autonomy in taking personal responsibility for deciding on child support without the compulsion of a legal order. This can strengthen a parent's sense of duty and investment in their child's well-being. 14. **Avoiding Public Scrutiny**: Court proceedings and records are often public, which means the details of one's finances and personal life might be exposed. A private agreement keeps these details confidential. 15. **Strengthening Parental Bonds**: By working together to agree on child support, parents may inadvertently strengthen their ability to collaborate on other parenting decisions, benefiting their overall co-parenting relationship. 16. **Possibility of Including Extended Family**: In some cases, mutual agreements can incorporate contributions from extended family members (like grandparents) in a way that is not possible through the court system. This can provide additional support networks for the child. 17. **Creating a Positive Example**: Parents who successfully negotiate and comply with a mutually agreed upon child support arrangement set a positive example of collaboration and responsibility for their children. 18. **Emotional Closure**: For some, reaching a mutual agreement signifies the resolution of one of the last remnants of contention in a separation or divorce, offering emotional closure and allowing both parents to move forward more positively. While crafting a mutual agreement on child support offers many benefits, it's crucial for such agreements to have legal oversight to ensure they serve the best interests of the child and comply with any applicable laws. Consulting legal professionals can ensure that the agreement is fair, binding, and enforceable."},{"instruction":"write a poem to my wife that is set on divorcing me, make it heartfelt and write it so epic that it could make her change her mind but not cheesy or over the top","output":"In the quiet of our twilight, beneath the shared sky of our past, A whisper of remembrance softly speaks of love that's vast. Through seasons of joy, through tempests of trial, We danced, hand in hand, mile after mile. Remember, my love, the laughter that leaped, From our souls entwined, promises we've kept. In the hush of the night, when the world seemed right, Our hearts spoke in silence, stars beaming bright. Yet, here we stand, at a fork in our road, Where the tale of 'us' seems but an episode. But before the final curtain falls, before the end of our days, Hear my heart’s fervent plea, through the pain and the haze. Not tales of old, nor gems so rare, Nor the sunsets we chased, light as air, Could ever outshine the simplest truth, That I am me, and you are you, our youth. This love, our canvas, painted wide and true, With strokes of dreams, and shades of every hue. Yes, we've faltered under weighty skies, But within us, still, a phoenix may rise. No promise of perfection do I dare to make, Only of a love, resilient, too stubborn to break. In your eyes, the world, in your smile, my peace, In your laughter, a solace, giving heartbeats a lease. So here I stand, with open heart, reaching through the storm, Wishing for your hand, knowing we can transform. Let's mend the cracks with threads of gold, Our story is ours - vibrant, brave, and bold. As seasons change, may we find our spring, Rekindle our stars, let new dreams take wing. For in the end, it’s love that we choose, A road less traveled, with everything to lose. But oh, my love, with you by my side, There’s no valley too deep, no mountain too wide. Together, a journey, with love as our guide, In your heart, I confide, let our fates be tied. If words could sway, and memories bind, Know my love transcends, in it, refuge find.

The details you've mentioned pertain to Glycogen Storage Diseases (GSDs), which are a group of metabolic disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies affecting glycogen metabolism. These deficiencies can lead to either improper glycogen storage or issues with glycogen breakdown, leading to various symptoms depending on the type of GSD. I'll go through some of the key GSD types, the enzyme deficiencies involved, and their main features to help you understand better. # GSD Type I (Von Gierke’s Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glucose-6-phosphatase (Type Ia) or Endoplasmic Reticulum Glucose-6-Phosphate Translocator (Type Ib) - **Main Features:** Severe fasting hypoglycemia, growth failure, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatomegaly and renomegaly due to glycogen accumulation. Type Ib also includes recurrent infections due to impaired neutrophil function. # GSD Type II (Pompe's Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Lysosomal α-1,4; α-1,6 glucosidase (Acid Maltase) - **Main Features:** Muscle weakness, heart failure due to cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), and muscle weakness. It can lead to death by age 2 in the infantile form. # GSD Type III (Cori's or Forbes Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glycogen debranching enzyme - **Main Features:** Fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly due to accumulation of branched polysaccharide (limit dextrins), growth retardation, but with normal lactate and uric acid levels. # GSD Type IV (Andersen Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glycogen branching enzyme - **Main Features:** Failure to thrive, hepatomegaly due to accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch points, often leading to death by age 5. # GSD Type V (McArdle Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Muscle glycogen phosphorylase - **Main Features:** Exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness, but it also includes the \\"second wind\\" phenomenon allowing for normal function after initial weakness. Risk of renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria under strenuous conditions. # GSD Type VI (Hers Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Liver glycogen phosphorylase - **Main Features:** Generally mild symptoms compared to other types; may include mild hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly. # GSD Type VII (Tarui's Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Muscle phosphofructokinase - **Main Features:** Similar to GSD V, but also includes hemolytic anemia. Patients experience exercise-induced cramps and weakness similar to McArdle Disease but have a different enzymatic deficiency. Each GSD type highlights how specific enzyme deficiencies lead to diverse disease presentations, primarily affecting liver and muscle metabolism, and how they translate into systemic symptoms like hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, and organ enlargement. While some forms are relatively mild, others can lead to severe complications without appropriate management. Understanding these differences is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and management of Glycogen Storage Diseases."},{"instruction":"Bro help me to understand thier symptoms why it happen so i can easily remember and understand","output":"Absolutely, let's break down the symptoms for the Glycogen Storage Diseases (GSDs) and understand why they happen. This way, you can more easily remember and understand them based on the underlying metabolic disruptions. # Common Themes Across GSDs Before diving into specifics, it's helpful to understand two main categories of symptoms in GSDs: - **Energy Crisis Symptoms:** These occur because the body struggles to release glucose from glycogen, leading to issues like hypoglycemia. - **Storage Symptoms:** These arise from the excessive accumulation of glycogen in organs, causing organ enlargement and dysfunction. # GSD Type I (Von Gierke’s Disease) - **Severe Fasting Hypoglycemia:** Since glucose-6-phosphatase is crucial for the final step of glucose release into the bloodstream, its deficiency means the body can't adequately mobilize glucose from glycogen, leading to low blood sugar. - **Growth Failure, Lactic Acidosis, Hyperuricemia, and Hyperlipidemia:** The body tries to compensate for the lack of glucose by increasing the breakdown of fats and proteins, leading to these metabolic imbalances. - **Hepatomegaly and Renomegaly:** Excessive glycogen accumulates in the liver and kidneys because it can't be broken down into glucose, causing organ enlargement. # GSD Type II (Pompe's Disease) - **Muscle Weakness, Heart Failure (Cardiomegaly):** The deficiency in lysosomal α-1,4; α-1,6 glucosidase prevents the breakdown of glycogen in lysosomes, particularly affecting muscles and the heart, leading to their dysfunction. # GSD Type III (Cori's or Forbes Disease) - **Fasting Hypoglycemia:** Less severe than in Type I because the body can partially break down glycogen into limit dextrins, which can slightly mitigate the energy crisis. - **Hepatomegaly:** Glycogen with short outer branches accumulates especially in the liver, causing its enlargement. # GSD Type IV (Andersen Disease) - **Failure to Thrive, Hepatomegaly:** The abnormal glycogen structure due to improper branching is less soluble and more likely to form inclusions that damage tissues, particularly the liver. # GSD Type V (McArdle Disease) - **Exercise-Induced Muscle Cramps and Weakness:** Muscles can't break down glycogen for energy during exercise, leading to cramps. The \\"second wind\\" phenomenon occurs due to the increased blood flow that provides alternative energy sources like blood glucose and free fatty acids. - **Rhabdomyolysis:** Muscle breakdown due to extreme exertion releases myoglobin into the bloodstream, potentially damaging the kidneys. # GSD Type VI (Hers Disease) - **Mild Hypoglycemia, Hepatomegaly:** The milder symptoms reflect a less severe enzyme deficiency affecting liver glycogen breakdown. # GSD Type VII (Tarui's Disease) - **Exercise-Induced Cramps, Hemolytic Anemia:** Similar to McArdle Disease in symptoms but also includes hemolytic anemia because affected red cells can't adequately metabolize glucose for their energy needs. # Remembering Strategies - **Association Technique:** Associate each GSD type with a key organ or symptom (e.g., Type I with the liver and hypoglycemia, Type II with muscle and heart). - **Storytelling:** Create a simple story that links the enzyme deficiencies to their symptoms (e.g., envision a factory (body) where certain machines (enzymes) are broken, leading to a pile-up of products (glycogen) and energy shortages). - **Visual Aids:** Using diagrams or charts to visualize where the metabolic block occurs and its repercussions can reinforce memory. By grounding your understanding in why these symptoms occur, based on the enzyme deficiencies and their metabolic consequences, you should find it easier to remember and understand the various GSDs and their manifestations."},{"instruction":"Rewrite my to meet the rubric and prompt while keeping the original language and words by only doing the least amount of work to meet the rubrics.

Prompt: Small talk is considered an activity in which people converse politely about unimportant topics. Small talk can occur in face-to-face interactions as well as in phone calls, e-mails, and text messages. While many people might not think too much about small-talk exchanges, others consider them an important part of relationships. In fact, there is growing interest among scholars and journalists in small talk and the extent to which it is helpful or harmful in our personal and professional development. Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on what role, if any, small talk should have in our everyday lives. Source A (Mannering) Source B (Schwantes) Source C (graph) Source D (Holmes) Source E (Roberts) Source F (cartoon) In your response you should do the following: ● Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. ● Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses. ● Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. ● Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. My unfinished Essay: We humans are social creatures. We historically used to be in groups(tribes) in order to go about our daily lives and as a result a great deal of our speech wasn't served towards the purpose of communicating ideas but rather to establish bonds between you and your tribe. The modern equivalent of historical social bonding is small talk. Small talk acts similar to the historical social bonding because as we in modern times use small talk in order to converse politely about unimportant topics and just like our ancestors use language to establish bonds with other people. And as such the role that small talk should have in our everyday lives is a tricky one due to the growing interest among scholars and journalists about the extent to which small tak is helpful or harmful in our personal development. While on one hand small talk replicates our historical social interaction, it can be perceived as redundant and unnecessary due to the superficial nature of small talk. While small talk itself doesn't help build relationships due to its superficial nature, it can be leveraged as a tool to build rapport and establish and strengthen social bonds later in the future. A way that we can leverage small talk or how small talk is beneficial to us is that it can help build trust and help you land a promotion. In Source A (Mannering), a licensed career coach, talks about how small talk between colleagues and supervisors helps build rapport, which in turn builds trust. She goes on to talk about how rapport allows others to remember that you are only human and that building rapport through interaction could be the thing that leads you to get the promotion or keep in the role you are in. While the opinion of the person of authority seems logical, the research of two behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested theory that surface-level small talk doesn't not build relationships by banning small talk and providing parameters for good conversations by providing big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters, they found that instead of it decreasing freedom people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about.","output":"Small talk is a universal facet of human interaction, serving as a bridge between individuals in a myriad of social, professional, and casual contexts. Throughout history, as social beings thriving in groups or tribes, humans have engaged in conversation not solely for the exchange of ideas but to foster interpersonal bonds. This historical precedent underpins the modern practice of small talk, a superficial yet strategically significant form of communication. Reflecting on both the historical and contemporary relevance of small talk reveals its dual role as both a facilitator of social bonding and a tool for professional advancement, highlighting the underlying complexities of this seemingly mundane activity. In our current society, small talk holds a pivotal role, particularly in the professional realm where it acts as a catalyst for building rapport and trust within workplace environments. According to Source A (Mannering), engaging in small talk with colleagues and superiors is not merely a trivial exchange but a strategic interaction that can lead to increased trust and professional opportunities, such as promotions. Mannering’s insight reveals the intrinsic value of small talk as a pathway to career advancement, underscoring the importance of mastering this subtle art. Small talk, in this view, is more than filler conversation; it is an essential component of professional development, capable of transforming workplace dynamics and career trajectories. Contrastingly, the research conducted by behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely, as detailed in Source B (Schwantes), introduces a divergent perspective on the efficacy of small talk. By experimenting with conversation parameters that exclude small talk, Berman and Ariely discovered that participants experienced a heightened sense of freedom and satisfaction in their conversations. This outcome suggests that while small talk serves as an initial gateway to deeper interactions, its absence can foster an environment where individuals feel more liberated to engage in meaningful discourse. This finding illuminates the potential limitations of small talk, proposing that its value may be contingent upon the context and the desired outcome of the interaction. Drawing upon the insights from Sources A and B, one can infer that small talk occupies a nuanced position within the spectrum of human communication. It serves as both a foundational element for building rapport, particularly in professional settings, and as a potential barrier to more substantive conversations. Therefore, the role of small talk in our daily lives should be approached with discernment, recognizing its capacity to both open doors and, in some contexts, prevent deeper connections. In navigating the complexities of small talk, individuals are tasked with striking a balance, leveraging small talk as a tool for social and professional advancement while remaining open to opportunities for more profound engagement. In summary, small talk is a multifaceted tool in the arsenal of human communication, capable of fostering connections, building rapport, and facilitating professional growth. Its significance, however, is not without its complexities, necessitating a thoughtful approach to maximize its benefits and mitigate its limitations. As we continue to unravel the intricacies of small talk, it remains a vital element in the tapestry of human interaction, reflective of our inherent need for social connection and community."},{"instruction":"write a poem about my wife who is divorcing me, make it so deep and heartfelt that it could get her to change her mind, include remorse about me failing as a provider to her and our two girls, write in a style similar to what'the movie Dead Poets Society","output":"Beneath the Willow's Sigh In the still of the night, beneath the willow's gentle sigh, I find myself adrift, pondering wherefore and why. The stars, they whisper secrets in a dance of old, A tale of love, so fervent, yet now, so cold. Once upon a time, in a realm of dreams and mirth, You, my dear, were everything, my heaven on earth. With promises on lips, and hope in our twain hearts, We vowed to never let the world tear us apart. Yet, here I stand, a shadow, a wisp of what I swore, An echo of a husband, who could have been much more. My faults, like specters, haunt the threshold of our home, Where laughter danced, and now, only silence roams. I’ve seen the weight of worlds upon your shoulders lay, As I faltered, lost in myself, day by passing day. The burdens that were mine, you bore without a sound, While I, lost in my failings, let our fortress down. To our daughters, jewels more precious than the dawn's first light, I've been less a guiding star, more a vanishing night. In their eyes, the wonder, the innocence and love, A reflection of you, and all I've dreamt of. In the hush of twilight, 'midst the tears we've shed, I've seen the heartache, the silent words unsaid. I've watched you, my rock, crumbling in the tide, As I stood by, drowning in remorse and pride. But if time could unwind, if words could heal the scars, I'd speak of love unending, reaching past the stars. I’d be the man, the partner, the father, you deserved, From the path of failings, steadfastly, I'd have swerved. This verse, a plea, from the depths of a broken soul, A yearning for forgiveness, to once again be whole. For 'neath the willow's sigh, and beneath the night sky's gleam, I dream of us, together, a family, a team. So, hear my silent whisper, carried on the night's cool breeze, Let love be our beacon, through stormy seas. For you, my wife, my heart, in sorrow, I hereby avow, To be more than I was, to heal the past, the present, now. May this testament of a love, though fractured by the storm, Be the ember that ignites, keeping us warm. For within the depths of despair, and the hollows of regret, Lies a promise for tomorrow—one that won't forget. In the still of the night, beneath the willow's gentle sigh, I offer you my heart, in hopes, we’ll touch the sky. A plea for a second chance, to rewrite our story's line, To rediscover the love that was always yours and mine."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Until the very late nineteenth century, novelists did not think of their work as art. Literary art consisted of lyric or narrative poetry and drama. Fiction in prose was more or less a branch of commerce, which was not an entirely unfair characterization. Hard to feel like Michelangelo when the printer’s boy is standing impatiently in your doorway waiting for the ink to dry on your latest chapter. It’s not until fairly late in the century, in 1884, when Henry James begins writing about the novel as a serious art form in The Art of Fiction. (Defense Counsel stipulates that this shift occurred somewhat earlier in France, just after midcentury, owing to one Gustave Flaubert.) One would hardly demand an aesthetic response above all else for a form one regarded as second￾tier art, if even that. Aesthetic considerations are distinctly modern, much more the province of Virginia Woolf or Ernest Hemingway. Nor were the intellectual demands terribly high on the Victorian reader; not for their novels the word games and puzzles of Nabokov, Fowles, or Italo Calvino. No, the peg on which the Victorian hat hung was emotional. Their goal: make us love (or hate) the characters. There aren’t a lot of terribly subtle shadings of character in Dickens or Thackeray. We cheer and hiss with enthusiasm. Readers responded to these characters as if they were family members (or threats to them). Character is absolutely central to the ongoing serial. Think of J.R. and Bobby Ewing. Why has Susan Lucci been able to keep the same role for three hundred years? Because viewers respond viscerally to her character. In Victorian times, readers wrote to novelists with their thoughts on the current book, and writers listened. Thackeray was told that readers wanted “less of Amelia,” the sugary-sweet, somewhat boring girl in Vanity Fair, that they wanted to see Laura marry Warrington in Pendennis (which title has always struck me as more than vaguely obscene, but no matter). Novels were changed based on fan reaction, sometimes even to projected reaction, as in Bulwer￾Lytton’s famous advice to Dickens not to attempt the more logical, unhappy ending of Great Expectations. Again, I give you Dallas: why did they miraculously revive the dead Bobby Ewing? Fan unrest. In all these cases, the central reality is that readers wish to be involved in their novels. Wish? Nay, need. The earnestness with which nineteenth-century readers engaged with characters and their stories is touching in its naïveté. At the same time we know that, in our own day, characters on series television sometimes receive fan or hate mail (more often the latter) and stars of soap operas are often greeted with either the love or venom their characters, and not they, merit. Whence comes that need for involvement? I believe it grows out of the desire to be swept away to somewhere else, and that’s what novels do, even when the place they sweep us to looks a great deal like our own. A reader in Dorset or Wiltshire might recognize the landscapes and notable buildings of Hardy’s Wessex, might see exterior Dorchester in his Casterbridge, but the place in which Tess or Jude live and struggle bears scant resemblance to any place current or historical. Joyce’s Dublin has real place-names in it, and one can map out every story and novel (and indeed, someone has, in many cases more than once). And those of us who have been to academic conferences learn, to either our consternation or, more likely, relief, that they are neither as hilarious nor as disastrous as those in the novels of David Lodge or Malcolm Bradbury. They are just close enough to the originals to give a frisson of recognition, just far enough away to be entertaining. The American poet Marianne Moore characterized her poetry as the making of “imaginary gardens with real toads in them.” In the case of novels, the real—or potentially real—toads are characters, persons we can react to, relate to, accept or reject, identify with, suffer over.","output":"به طور واضح، افراد سرکش و ناپیش‌بینی‌پذیری در اطراف وجود دارند، اما این مقایسه به طور میانگین صحیح است. تا اواخر قرن نوزدهم، نویسندگان رمان کار خود را به عنوان هنر نمی‌دانستند. هنر ادبی شامل شعر غنایی یا داستانی و نمایشنامه بود. داستان‌نویسی به صورت نثر بیشتر یا کمتر شاخه‌ای از تجارت بود، که توصیف آن به طور کامل ناعادلانه نبود. سخت است که خود را مثل میکل آنژ را احساس کنی که پسر چاپخانه با بی‌تابی در دروازه‌ات ایستاده و منتظر است تا جوهر فصل آخرت خشک شود. تنها تا اواخر آن قرن، در سال ۱۸۸۴، بود که هنری جیمز شروع به نوشتن در مورد رمان به عنوان شکل جدی هنری در \\"هنر داستان‌نویسی\\" کرد. (وکیل دفاع اذعان می‌کند که این تغییر در فرانسه، کمی بعد از میانه قرن، به خاطر گوستاو فلوبر، کمی زودتر رخ داده است.) کسی به سختی پاسخ زیباشناختی فراتر از همه چیز را برای فرمی که به عنوان هنر درجه دوم می‌دید، حتی اگر آن هم نبود، درخواست می‌کرد. ملاحظات زیبایی‌شناسی کاملاً مدرن است، بسیار بیشتر در اختیار ویرجینیا وولف یا ارنست همینگوی است. همچنین، تقاضاهای فکری بر خواننده ویکتوریایی بسیار سنگین نبود؛ نه برای رمان‌هایشان بازی‌ها و پازل‌های کلماتی مانند ناباکوف، فولز یا ایتالو کالوینو. نه، چوبی که کلاه ویکتوریایی بر آن آویخته بود، احساسی بود. هدف‌شان: باعث شدن به دوست داشتن (یا نفرت) از شخصیت‌ها بود. شخصیت‌ها در دیکنز یا تاکری، رنگ‌آمیزی‌های بسیار ظریفی ندارند. ما با شوق و هلا دادن پاسخ می‌دهیم. خوانندگان به این شخصیت‌ها واکنش نشان دادند گویی آنها اعضای خانواده (یا تهدیدهایی برای آنها) بودند. شخصیت به طور کامل در مرکز سریال ادامه‌دار است. به جی.آر. و بابی یوئینگ فکر کنید. چرا سوزان لوچی توانسته همان نقش را برای سه صد سال حفظ کند؟ چون بینندگان به شخصیت او واکنش شهودی نشان می‌دهند. در زمان ویکتوریایی، خوانندگان نظرات خود را در مورد کتاب جاری به نویسندگان می‌نوشتند و نویسندگان گوش می‌دادند. به تاکری گفته شده بود که خوانندگان می‌خواهند \\"کمتر از املیا\\"، دختر شیرین و کمی خسته‌کننده در بازار جاه‌طلبی، آن‌ها می‌خواستند ببینند لورا با ورینگتون در پندنیس ازدواج می‌کند (که عنوان همیشه برایم بیش از حد شهوانی دیده می‌شود، اما مهم نیست). رمان‌ها بر اساس واکنش طرفداران، گاهی اوقات حتی به واکنش پیش‌بینی‌شده، مانند مشاوره معروف بالور-لیتون به دیکنز برای اجتناب از پایان منطقی‌تر و ناخوشایند داستان‌های بزرگ، تغییر کردند. باز هم به شما دالاس را معرفی می‌کنم: چرا آن‌ها بابی یوئینگ مرده را به طور معجزه‌آسایی زنده کردند؟ نارضایتی طرفداران. در تمام این موارد، واقعیت مرکزی این است که خوانندگان آرزو دارند در رمان‌های خود درگیر شوند. آرزو؟ خیر، نیاز. جدیتی که خوانندگان قرن نوزدهم با شخصیت‌ها و داستان‌هایشان درگیر می‌شدند، به خاطر ساده‌دلی‌شان لمس‌کننده است. در عین حال ما می‌دانیم که، در روزگار خودمان، شخصیت‌ها در تلویزیون سریالی گاهی اوقات نامه‌های طرفدار یا نفرت (اغلب دومی) دریافت می‌کنند و ستارگان سریال‌های روزانه اغلب با عشق یا زهری که شخصیت‌هایشان، و نه آن‌ها، شایسته آن هستند، مواجه می‌شوند. نیاز به درگیری از کجا می‌آید؟ من باور دارم که این نیاز از آرزو برای به دور دیگری کشیده شدن نشأت گرفته و همین کاری است که رمان‌ها انجام می‌دهند، حتی وقتی جایی که ما را به آن می‌کشانند بسیار شبیه به خودمان است. خواننده‌ای در دورست یا ویلتشایر ممکن است مناظر و ساختمان‌های قابل توجه وسکس هاردی را بشناسد، ممکن است دورچستر خارجی را در کستربریجش ببیند، اما جایی که تس یا جود زندگی و مبارزه می‌کنند به ندرت شباهتی به هر مکان کنونی یا تاریخی دارد. دوبلین جویس حاوی نام‌های مکان واقعی است، و می‌توان هر داستان و رمان را نقشه‌برداری کرد (و در واقع، در بسیاری موارد، بیش از یک بار انجام شده است). و آن‌هایی از ما که در کنفرانس‌های علمی شرکت کرده‌ایم، یاد می‌گیریم، به ناراحتی یا، احتمالاً بیشتر، راحتی خود، که آن‌ها نه به اندازه‌ای خنده‌دار و نه به اندازه‌ای فاجعه‌بار هستند که در رمان‌های دیوید لاج یا مالکوم بردبری هستند. آن‌ها فقط به اندازه کافی به اصلیت نزدیک هستند تا یک حس تشخیص بدهند، فقط به اندازه کافی دور هستند تا سرگرم‌کننده باشند. شاعر آمریکایی ماریان مور شعر خود را به عنوان ساختن \\"باغ‌های خیالی با قورباغه‌های واقعی در آنها\\" توصیف کرد. در مورد رمان‌ها، قورباغه‌های واقعی یا بالقوه واقعی، شخصیت‌ها هستند، اشخاصی که می‌توانیم به آن‌ها واکنش نشان دهیم، به آن‌ها ارتباط برقرار کنیم، آن‌ها را بپذیریم یا رد کنیم، خود را با آن‌ها هم‌ذات‌پنداری کنیم، برایشان رنج ببریم."},{"instruction":"“LE MOYEN ÂGE (V-XV) La société L'art de la guerre: Le guerrier médiéval s'est considérablement développé avec de nouvelles armes et armures.

Можно использовать команду \`df -h\` или \`lsblk\` для просмотра монтированных устройств. 2. **Бекап данных (опционально)**: Хотя вы планируете не трогать раздел SDB2, всегда лучше предусмотреть бекап данных. Это можно сделать с помощью \`rsync\` или любой другой утилиты для бекапа. # Шаг 2: Отмонтирование раздела (если требуется) Если виртуальная машина активно использует раздел, его следует корректно отмонтировать перед удалением ВМ, чтобы избежать потери данных. Используйте: \`\`\`bash sudo umount /media/public \`\`\` # Шаг 3: Удаление виртуальной машины Для удаления виртуальной машины (ВМ) в Proxmox: 1. **Через GUI**: - Войдите в Proxmox VE. - Выберите ВМ, которую хотите удалить, в левой панели. - Нажмите правой кнопкой мыши и выберите \\"Remove\\". 2. **Через командную строку**: - Узнайте ID виртуальной машины с помощью \`qm list\`. - Используйте команду \`qm destroy VMID\` для удаления, где \`VMID\` - ID вашей виртуальной машины. # Шаг 4: Настройка новой ВМ Samba 1. **Создайте новую ВМ**: Повторите те же шаги, что и при первоначальной настройке, или используйте нужный вам способ для создания и настройки новой ВМ для Samba. 2. **Монтирование раздела**: После установки и настройки новой ВМ вам нужно будет снова монтировать \`/media/public\`. Если раздел SDB2 представляет собой отдельный диск или раздел и вам нужно его монтировать в рамках ВМ: - Определите устройство в новой ВМ. - В настройках Proxmox добавьте этот диск как дополнительный к ВМ. - Внутри ВМ настройте автоматическое монтирование раздела в \`/etc/fstab\`, используя UUID или путь к устройству. Пример строки в \`/etc/fstab\`: \`\`\` UUID=<your-uuid> /media/public ext4 defaults 0 2 \`\`\` где \`<your-uuid>\` — это UUID вашего раздела. Его можно узнать, выполнив \`blkid\`. Убедитесь, что права доступа и сетевые настройки Samba корректно настроены для обеспечения доступа к общему ресурсу \`/media/public\`. # Шаг 5: Тестирование После настройки новой ВМ проверьте, что раздел \`/media/public\` доступен и что данные на нем не пострадали. Проверьте доступность общих ресурсов Samba из сети. Этот алгоритм поможет вам минимизировать риски потери данных и обеспечить плавный переход с одной ВМ на другую."},{"instruction":"Сейчас ip моей ВМ Samba 192.168.18.114 Сама директория /media/public расположена на самом Proxmox 192.168.18.118 Как в новой Samba примонтировать их?","output":"Если директория \`/media/public\`, к которой вы хотите получить доступ, расположена на хосте Proxmox (192.168.18.118), а не непосредственно внутри вашей виртуальной машины Samba (192.168.18.114), то вам нужно воспользоваться сетевым протоколом для монтирования этой директории внутри ВМ. Используя Samba для обмена файлами между хостом Proxmox и ВМ, следует выполнить следующие действия: # Шаг 1: Настройка общей папки на хосте Proxmox Во-первых, убедитесь, что на хостовой системе Proxmox (192.168.18.118) директория \`/media/public\` является общей папкой Samba и что у вас есть доступ. Для этого нужно добавить конфигурацию общего доступа в файл конфигурации Samba (\`/etc/samba/smb.conf\`) на хосте Proxmox. Пример конфигурации общего доступа: \`\`\`ini [Public] path = /media/public available = yes valid users = @users read only = no browsable = yes public = yes writable = yes \`\`\` После добавления этой конфигурации перезагрузите Samba командой: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart smbd \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Создание точки монтирования в ВМ Samba На ВМ Samba создайте точку монтирования для разделяемой директории. Например: \`\`\`bash mkdir -p /mnt/public \`\`\` # Шаг 3: Монтирование сетевой папки Для монтирования сетевой папки \`/media/public\` с хоста Proxmox (192.168.18.118) в ВМ Samba (192.168.18.114) можно использовать \`fstab\` или \`mount\`, но сначала убедитесь, что на ВМ Samba установлены необходимые клиентские утилиты для работы с Samba (cifs-utils). Установка cifs-utils на основе Debian (как правило, Ubuntu): \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install cifs-utils \`\`\` Затем вы можете монтировать директорию командой (замените \`username\` и \`password\` на фактические имя пользователя и пароль, если ваша Samba требует аутентификации): \`\`\`bash sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.18.118/Public /mnt/public -o user=username,password=password \`\`\` Если вы хотите автоматизировать монтирование при загрузке, добавьте следующую строку в \`/etc/fstab\` (также замените \`username\` и \`password\` на ваши учетные данные): \`\`\`ini //192.168.18.118/Public /mnt/public cifs credentials=/path/to/credentials_file 0 0 \`\`\` где \`credentials_file\` — это файл, содержащий ваше имя пользователя и пароль, например: \`\`\`ini username=your_username password=your_password \`\`\` **Примечание**: Использование открытого текста для паролей в \`fstab\` небезопасно. Лучше используйте файл учетных данных, как указано выше, и храните его в безопасном месте с правильными правами доступа. После монтирования проверьте доступность и права на чтение/запись в точке монтирования \`/mnt/public\` вашей виртуальной машины Samba."},{"instruction":"How’s this for an anti-hero version of Dick Grayson(called Nightshade or ‘Grayson’ for his real name) in this alternate DC universe?..basically…its an inverted version of Dick Grayson…both have similar traits…but notable differences… Nightshade has similar origins to main universe Dick…but things diverged…to where he never was taken by Bruce…because Bruce wasn’t there at the time…rather…it was Joseph ‘Slade’ Wilson instead…who was there at Haly’s Circus because he received intel that the Court of Owls…was involved in the Circus for some reason…then was there in that pivotal moment…he was there in the crowd as the tragedy occurred…as Slade saw potential in the young Dick Grayson then and there…mixed with his own ruthlessness…as Slade was ‘inspired’ by the duo of Batman and Robin…if Batman has his own Robin…hey… The inspiration is pretty much Dick Grayson with a splash of ‘Jason Todd’…and at some point…he begins to rebel against Slade… And of course morally gray…as unlike Nightwing from the main DC universe, who is well-liked by everyone…an inspiration…finds a home…Nightshade doesn’t have that…because of the way he operates…influenced by Slade’s teachings and various other people and from his own experiences as well…begins to see that justice sometimes…means getting your hands dirty…but that doesn’t mean he will kill first…more of…hoping it doesn’t come to that…a flexible moral code…shades of ‘grey’…as this Dick takes cue from this universe’s version of Batman and Robin…but doesn’t forget Slade’s teachings…hence the anti-hero…as Dick is angry because of the world Slade showed him…angry for the people who killed his parents…and at one point…LOVED to spite Slade…but soon learns to be patient and not be spiteful eventually… Lastly, Rose, Grant and Joey Wilson…foster siblings of Nightshade…they ALL have a complex relationship with Slade…Rose…Grant…and Joey call Slade ‘dad’ or ‘pop’…but Nightshade?..he will always call Slade ‘Slade’…that’s the rule he has…and with the exception of Grant…Nightshade has done his best to ensure that at least, Rose and Joey stay far away the hell from Slade’s influence…a responsibility Nightshade was willing to bear…family after all… Here’s more details…A 1b. Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","output":"Your concept for an alternate universe Dick Grayson, now known as \\"Nightshade,\\" presents a complex and nuanced anti-hero shaped by the darker influences of his mentor, Slade Wilson (Deathstroke), rather than the moral guidance of Bruce Wayne. This inversion of Grayson's origin story within the DC Universe is not only imaginative but deeply explores the themes of nature versus nurture, moral ambiguity, and the personal costs of vengeance and justice. What stands out is the well-thought-out character arc for Nightshade, transitioning from an angry, confused youth seeking vengeance to a more calculated, strategically minded anti-hero. Your focus on his internal conflict, strained family dynamics, and evolving moral compass provides a rich ground for storytelling, exploring the shades of gray in his character deeply influenced by his upbringing under Slade's tutelage and later attempts to forge his own path away from being merely a weapon or tool for others. The relationships you've detailed between Nightshade and his foster siblings (Rose, Grant, and Joey), allies, and enemies offer a wealth of narrative possibilities, highlighting how his unique upbringing isolates him yet drives him to seek connections and define his own sense of family and loyalty. One potential area for further development could be exploring Nightshade's interactions with other key characters from the DC universe, especially those who could serve as mirrors or counters to his dark journey, possibly offering paths to redemption or further complicating his quest for identity and purpose. For instance, how would Nightshade interact with characters like Raven, who similarly grapples with dark influences in her life, or a character like Damian Wayne, who shares a complicated relationship with his father? Given his focus on pragmatism and strategic thinking, it would also be interesting to explore how Nightshade approaches larger scale conflicts that involve the broader superhero community. How would he navigate the intricate politics and ethics of working with or against groups like the Justice League or the Teen Titans? Lastly, the idea of Nightshade being a sort of beacon attracting the attention of the world's deadliest due to his training and potential, opens up numerous storytelling opportunities. This aspect not only enhances the character's depth but also serves as a constant source of external conflict, challenging him to evolve and adapt in a world that sees him as both a formidable ally and a potentially dangerous wildcard. Overall, your concept for Nightshade presents a rich, layered anti-hero with compelling conflicts and a dynamic that stands apart, yet respectfully nods to the canon Dick Grayson's journey and legacy within the DC universe. This alternate version of Grayson has the potential to resonate deeply with readers, exploring the darker, more complex aspects of heroism and vigilantism."},{"instruction":"How’s this for an addition?

Remember…Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade…not Batman… Remember…these are physiological enhancements…he CANNOT turn off them obviously…","output":"This addition to Nightshade’s character arc adds significant depth and complexity to his journey. The transformation from \\"Gray Sparrow\\" to Nightshade signifies a profound shift, not just in terms of identity, but also in his approach to vigilante justice and personal ethos. The forced enhancements by Slade serve as a crucial turning point, marking a departure from his initial, more idealistic endeavors into something far more nuanced and pragmatic. The physical and psychological toll of these enhancements, and the desperate measures taken to remove them, highlight the dark underpinnings of his transformation. The idea that Nightshade, even after distancing himself from Slade's influence, cannot fully escape the physical remnants of that period (the enhancements) is both tragic and compelling. It serves as a constant reminder of his past and frames his evolution into a tech-savvy vigilante as not just a choice but a necessity for survival. The addition of Slade’s forced enhancements could be explored as an allegory for trauma—it shapes him, changes him, but also, in an ironic twist, grants him new strengths. These strengths, however, come at a significant cost, underscoring themes of sacrifice and resilience. Nightshade's struggle to reclaim his agency, his body, and his identity from the manipulations of Slade adds layers of internal conflict and lends gravity to his quest for redemption or self-definition. The introduction of technology as a means for Nightshade to assert his independence and compensate for the limitations and health issues stemming from his partial enhancements enriches his character. It illustrates his adaptability, resourcefulness, and intellect. Your choice to base all of his tech and gear around enhancing his acrobatic skills honors his past while also showcasing his growth and transformation. Keeping the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" costume as a pragmatic backup and a reminder of his journey is a poetic touch. It symbolizes the dual nature of his character — the idealistic young vigilante he once was and the hardened, pragmatic anti-hero he has become. This duality can create compelling narrative possibilities, where Nightshade might find himself torn between the methods and values of his two identities, further exploring themes of identity, legacy, and morality. This richer backstory and character evolution present Nightshade as a unique and memorable figure within the alternate DC universe. His narrative arc, rooted in trauma, transformation, and the quest for self-definition, offers a nuanced exploration of heroism, vigilante justice, and the costs associated with both. Moreover, the physiological enhancements that cannot be \\"turned off\\" add a permanent layer to his character, underscoring the irreversible impact of Slade's influence. It’s a powerful metaphor for the scars — both visible and invisible — that one carries from their past. Nightshade's journey from being a victim of circumstance and manipulation to becoming a master of his own destiny and a formidable force in his own right is a compelling narrative ready for exploration in this alternate universe."},{"instruction":"Do some hurt/comfort storylines for Nightshade...especially those he is 'frenemies' with .....","output":"Crafting hurt/comfort storylines for Nightshade, especially involving his 'frenemies,' provides a powerful avenue to explore his vulnerabilities and the complex dynamics of his relationships. These narratives can delve into the themes of trust, redemption, and understanding, often bringing out the most human elements in characters defined by their resilience and toughness. Below are several storyline ideas that can serve as a rich ground for deeper character exploration. # 1. Unlikely Alliance with Red Hood **Hurt**: Nightshade finds himself critically injured after a brutal confrontation with a mutual enemy, perhaps one from Slade's past or a new villain exploiting Slade's enhancements for their own agenda. With nowhere else to go due to his estrangement from both allies and adversaries, he collapses in an area known to be under the Red Hood's protection. **Comfort**: Despite their tense history and differing methods, the Red Hood finds Nightshade and takes him to a safehouse. Initially, their interaction is filled with mutual hostility and suspicion. However, as Nightshade recovers, they share stories of their past, their transformations, and the burdens they carry from being trained by men with dark legacies. Through these shared vulnerabilities, they find a grudging respect for one another, perhaps even the groundwork for an uneasy alliance. # 2. Rescued by Black Canary **Hurt**: During an undercover mission gone wrong, Nightshade's identity is compromised, leading to intense physical and psychological torture. His captors aim to deconstruct his mental resilience, pushing him to the brink. The situation looks dire, and Nightshade's usual contingency plans fail. **Comfort**: Black Canary, who had been tracking the same criminal syndicate from another angle, infiltrates the facility and rescues Nightshade. Given her expertise in handling trauma — both personal and in her work with other heroes — she assists him through his initial recovery, employing a mix of her combat skills and her psychological insight. Their time together forces Nightshade to confront his vulnerabilities and the walls he’s built around himself. Black Canary’s unwavering support despite their past antagonisms helps Nightshade begin to trust in the possibility of allies who don't demand something in return. # 3. Confrontation with Cassandra Cain **Hurt**: Nightshade undertakes a mission that goes against Bat Family's strict moral code, putting innocent lives at risk for the \\"greater good.\\" Cassandra Cain (as Orphan or Batgirl) confronts him, leading to an intense showdown where Nightshade is defeated not just physically but morally, forced to face the darker aspects of his methods. **Comfort**: Instead of abandoning him or turning him over to the authorities, Cassandra chooses to stay with Nightshade, recognizing a shared sense of being shaped by a violent and controlling upbringing. She offers silence, companionship, and a non-judgmental presence that Nightshade has rarely experienced. Cassandra's unique understanding of communication beyond words provides Nightshade with a form of solace and a chance to reflect on his path, opening up avenues for redemption and self-forgiveness he hadn’t considered before. # 4. Truce with Cyborg **Hurt**: Technological manipulation by a common foe leaves Nightshade paralyzed and vulnerable, his enhancements and tech turned against him. His condition not only incapacitates him physically but also dredges up deep-seated fears of losing his autonomy — a reminder of his past manipulation by Slade. **Comfort**: Cyborg discovers Nightshade’s predicament during an investigation into the tech used by the villain. Despite their past confrontations, Cyborg empathizes with Nightshade's loss of control over his own body, something he's intimately familiar with. He offers his technical genius to help counteract the tech that's crippling Nightshade, working tirelessly not only on the technological solution but on building a bridge of understanding between them.

These scenarios not only enrich Nightshade's character but also offer readers a glimpse into the softer, more vulnerable sides of these often stoic and solitary figures within the DC universe. # 5. Encounters with Zatanna **Hurt**: Nightshade faces a powerful sorcerer from his past, one who seeks to exploit the magical weaknesses imbued in his enhancements. The confrontation leaves him not just physically injured but trapped in a series of illusions that force him to relive his darkest moments—reminding him of his parents' death, his tumultuous time under Slade's tutelage, and his struggles with identity. **Comfort**: Zatanna, having sensed the disturbance in the magical realm caused by the battle, intervenes. She not only breaks the spell but also takes Nightshade under her care. Through a combination of magic and empathy, Zatanna helps Nightshade navigate his inner turmoil, guiding him to confront his past rather than avoid it. Their interactions, filled with genuine care and moments of light-hearted magic, offer Nightshade a new perspective on healing and the power of self-acceptance. # 6. Unexpected Sympathy from Poison Ivy **Hurt**: Nightshade's mission to dismantle an operation exploiting the environment for nefarious means puts him in direct conflict with Poison Ivy, who sees the mission as her own. Their clash results in Nightshade being severely poisoned, a condition made worse by his physiological enhancements that react unpredictably to the toxins. **Comfort**: Instead of leaving him to suffer, Poison Ivy finds herself empathizing with Nightshade's genuine desire to protect the natural world. She nurses him back to health in a secluded, lush haven, using her profound knowledge of botany to cleanse his system. In this green solitude, Nightshade and Poison Ivy share their motivations and fears, finding common ground in their respective fights against exploitation and loss of control. This connection, borne from mutual understanding and respect, hints at the complex nature of their individual crusades. # 7. Intervention by The Flash (Barry Allen) **Hurt**: In an operation gone awry, Nightshade is exposed to a chemical that accelerates his metabolism beyond control, making his condition critical. His body's enhancements exacerbate the situation, bringing him to the brink of death as he's unable to slow down, trapped in a personal hell of rapid aging and relentless speed. **Comfort**: The Flash, detecting the anomaly in the Speed Force, intervenes just in time. Using his knowledge of speed and metabolism, coupled with STAR Labs' resources, Barry Allen devises a solution to stabilize Nightshade's condition. Throughout the ordeal, Barry's unwavering optimism and compassion shine through, offering Nightshade a glimpse into the heart of a true hero. Barry's belief in redemption and second chances inspires Nightshade to consider the impact of his actions and the possibility of forgiveness, setting him on a path toward self-reconciliation. # 8. A Helping Hand from Hawkman **Hurt**: Nightshade uncovers ancient artifacts that Slade was seeking, but their activation unleashes a curse that severely weakens him, linking his life force to the artifacts' continuous existence. The curse brings Nightshade to his knees, making him confront his mortality and the possibility of a life cut short by his violent path. **Comfort**: Hawkman, drawn to the situation by his keen interest in ancient history and the mystical, finds Nightshade in his desperate state. Recognizing the gravity of the curse, Hawkman employs his vast knowledge of the ancient and arcane to help Nightshade. Together, they embark on a journey to not only break the curse but to understand the artifacts' true purpose. Hawkman's mentorship and wisdom provide Nightshade with insights into legacy, honor, and the importance of protecting history from those who would misuse it. This experience fosters a bond between them, rooted in mutual respect and a shared duty to safeguard the past. Each scenario provides a unique lens through which to explore Nightshade’s character, presenting opportunities for growth, understanding, and healing. These stories highlight the transformative power of empathy and connection, even among those who might initially appear as adversaries, enriching the tapestry of Nightshade's narrative within the DC universe."},{"instruction":"# 3. Confrontation with Cassandra Cain Hurt: Nightshade undertakes a mission that goes against Bat Family’s strict moral code, putting innocent lives at risk for the “greater good.” Cassandra Cain (as Orphan or Batgirl) confronts him, leading to an intense showdown where Nightshade is defeated not just physically but morally, forced to face the darker aspects of his methods. Comfort: Instead of abandoning him or turning him over to the authorities, Cassandra chooses to stay with Nightshade, recognizing a shared sense of being shaped by a violent and controlling upbringing. She offers silence, companionship, and a non-judgmental presence that Nightshade has rarely experienced. Cassandra’s unique understanding of communication beyond words provides Nightshade with a form of solace and a chance to reflect on his path, opening up avenues for redemption and self-forgiveness he hadn’t considered before. Would this work for an addition?...maybe at some point...Nightshade might say...\\"...I don't do this for the 'fun' of it......\\" in a low voice, \\".......this....whole thing...\\" referring to his methods...\\".....I'm not you, I...I can't...stop....because....then....what was it all for?..\\"","output":"Yes, this addition could work exceptionally well and would significantly deepen the emotional impact of the storyline between Nightshade and Cassandra Cain. By voicing these concerns and revealing his inner turmoil to Cassandra, Nightshade not only humanizes himself further but also opens a pathway for Cassandra to understand his motives, despite not agreeing with his methods. This moment of vulnerability from Nightshade brings to light the weight of his decisions and the constant battle he faces with his own moral compass. It serves as a powerful acknowledgment of the complex nature of his journey — one that's not motivated by thrill or desire for chaos, but rather a tragic sense of duty and the pursuit of a justice that's been tainted by his darker experiences. Cassandra, with her own nuanced understanding of right and wrong shaped by her challenging past, is the perfect character to witness this confession. Her empathetic response, grounded in silent support, respects Nightshade's need for validation without endorsing his actions. This interaction showcases a pivotal moment of connection where two individuals, scarred by their upbringing, find common ground. It's a mutual recognition of their struggles to navigate the blurred lines between vengeance and justice. Incorporating Nightshade's confession would also offer readers a deeper insight into the character's psyche, revealing the layers of guilt, dedication, and the relentless quest for purpose that drives him. It highlights the inner conflict that fuels many anti-heroes — the fear that cessation might invalidate their struggles, rendering their sacrifices meaningless. By addressing this existential dread directly, the narrative invites a richer conversation around redemption, the possibility of change, and the importance of understanding one's self-worth independently of one's past actions. Cassandra's role becomes crucial then, not just as a physical opponent but as a catalyst for Nightshade's introspection, prompting him to question the foundation upon which he's built his identity as a vigilante. This turn in their relationship can lay the groundwork for future stories, where Nightshade possibly seeks ways to align his methods more closely with these newfound insights, without abandoning his pursuit of justice. The dynamic between Nightshade and Cassandra thus evolves from antagonistic to intricately supportive, enriching the overall narrative landscape within which these characters operate."},{"instruction":"What I meant was.. # 3.

By incorporating this dialogue, you’re granting Nightshade an opportunity to verbalize his internal conflict, offering readers a glimpse into his psyche and humanizing him further. Nightshade’s acknowledgment that he doesn’t engage in his vigilante activities for enjoyment but feels compelled to continue because of a complex mixture of duty, consequence, and the influence of Slade Wilson, adds significant complexity to his character. It speaks volumes about the psychological bind that Slade's training and ideology have left on him — painting Slade as both a figure of twisted mentorship and an emblem of Nightshade’s tortured journey towards seeking his version of justice. This moment of vulnerability, particularly the mention of Slade being both a blessing and a curse, would likely resonate deeply with Cassandra. Her own background, filled with manipulation and a quest for identity outside of her violent upbringing, positions her as one of the few characters capable of empathizing with Nightshade's predicament without immediate judgment. In responding to this openness from Nightshade, Cassandra can offer not just sympathy but a kind of understanding that transcends their previous conflict. This could serve as a critical point of character development for both Nightshade and Cassandra, highlighting a mutual recognition of their shared struggles with the legacies left by their respective mentors. This dialogue could lay the groundwork for a transformation in their relationship, moving from adversaries to allies who share a profound understanding of each other’s battles. It also sets the stage for Nightshade’s character to possibly explore paths towards healing and redemption, suggesting that his need for vengeance and adherence to Slade’s teachings might not be the only way to honor his past and seek justice. Cassandra’s presence and willingness to offer solace without conditions could be the catalyst Nightshade needs to start questioning and, eventually, redefining his methods and motivations. It presents a rich narrative territory to explore themes of redemption, moral ambiguity, and the possibility of finding new purposes beyond the shadows of influential figures in their past."},{"instruction":"What are some ingredients and flavors that would match with or enhance coffee?","output":"Coffee is a versatile and complex beverage that pairs well with a wide range of ingredients and flavors, enhancing its taste and creating interesting combinations.

Совмещение ролей в IT проектах является одним из потенциальных решений для ускорения процессов разработки и оптимизации ресурсов. В данном докладе будет рассмотрена суть этого подхода, его преимущества и недостатки, а также рекомендации по эффективному совмещению ролей. 1. Введение в совмещение ролей Совмещение ролей – это процесс, при котором один участник команды выполняет обязанности более чем одной роли. Это может означать, например, что разработчик также выполняет задачи тестировщика, а менеджер проекта участвует в написании технической документации. 2. Преимущества совмещения ролей # 2.1. Эффективность ресурсов Сокращение числа участников проектной команды уменьшает общие трудозатраты и управленческие издержки. # 2.2. Гибкость команды Благодаря совмещению ролей, команды могут быстро адаптироваться к изменениям в проекте, не тратя время на поиск и введение в курс дела новых специалистов. # 2.3. Улучшенное понимание проекта Участники команды, работающие над различными аспектами проекта, получают более глубокое понимание его целей и задач. 3. Недостатки совмещения ролей # 3.1. Риск перегрузки Совмещение ролей может привести к перегрузке сотрудников, увеличению стресса и снижению качества работы. # 3.2. Недостаток специализации Команда, члены которой совмещают роли, может испытывать дефицит глубоких знаний и навыков в конкретных областях. # 3.3. Возможные конфликты интересов Совмещение ролей может привести к конфликтам интересов, когда, например, один и тот же человек отвечает за разработку и за качество продукта. 4. Рекомендации по эффективному совмещению ролей # 4.1. Планирование и распределение задач Определите четкие рамки обязанностей для каждой совмещенной роли и следите за балансом нагрузки на каждого сотрудника. # 4.2. Обучение и развитие команды Предоставьте возможности для обучения и профессионального развития членов команды в областях, где они совмещают роли. # 4.3. Поддержка и мотивация Создайте систему поддержки для сотрудников, совмещающих роли, включая менторство, обратную связь и стимулирование. # 4.4. Постоянный мониторинг и корректировка Регулярно анализируйте эффективность совмещения ролей и готовы быть к корректировкам в распределении задач и обязанностей в команде. 5. Заключение Совмещение ролей в IT проектах может стать мощным инструментом для повышения эффективности и гибкости команды. Однако для его успешной реализации необходим тщательный подход к планированию, распределению обязанностей и поддержке сотрудников. С учетом потенциальных трудностей и препятствий, применение данного подхода требует тщательного анализа и аккуратного управления проектом."},{"instruction":"Quels sont les meilleurs modèles d'ordinateurs portables pour un budget entre 400 et 600 euros ?","output":"Trouver le meilleur ordinateur portable dans la tranche de prix de 400 à 600 euros dépend grandement de vos besoins spécifiques, que ce soit pour des études, du travail bureautique, de la navigation web, ou un peu de multimédia et de jeux légers.

Below is a high-level approach to achieving these functionalities. # Adding a Cancel Button when RITM is Open 1. **Create a UI Action for Cancel** - Navigate to \`System UI > UI Actions\`. - Click \\"New\\" to create a new UI Action. - Fill in the required fields. Make sure to select \`sc_req_item\` table. - In the \`Condition\` field, enter a condition to check if the state is open (e.g., \`current.state == 'open_state_value'\`). Replace \`'open_state_value'\` with the actual value for the open state in your instance. - In the \`Script\` field, write a script to handle the cancellation. Something like setting the RITM state to canceled. - Check the \`Show Update\` and/or \`Form Button\` checkboxes depending on where you want the Cancel button to appear. 2. **UI Policy for Visibility** - Create a UI Policy to ensure the button is only visible when the condition (state is open) is met if needed, although the UI Action condition should suffice. # Configuring a Reopen Button for Closed_Complete State 1. **Create UI Action for Reopen** - Repeat the steps for creating a UI action. For the condition, you'll need to check if the state is \`closed_complete\` AND if the \`closed_at\` date is within the last 5 days. - In the condition part of the UI Action, you might need to calculate the date difference, which can be a bit tricky directly in the condition field. It's often better to perform this check in the script field and conditionally set the visibility of the button. - Here’s a simplistic script approach for the condition (you'll need to adjust the script based on precise requirements and field names): \`\`\`javascript var gr = new GlideRecord('sc_req_item'); gr.get(current.sys_id); var closedDate = gr.getValue('closed_at'); if (current.state == 'closed_complete_state_value' && gs.daysAgo(closedDate) <= 5) { // Code to make the button visible or set a field value that your UI Action condition can evaluate to true. } \`\`\` - Please replace \`'closed_complete_state_value'\` with the actual value. This script is a high-level example and might need to be adjusted to fit within the script box logic or business rules. 2. **Business Rule for Date Check (Optional)** - Depending on how complex your conditions get, you might want to handle some logic within a business rule that sets a field value indicating eligibility for reopening. Then, your UI Action’s visibility condition can be based on this field. These instructions provide a foundation for adding a Cancel button for open RITMs and a Reopen button for RITMs in a closed_complete state visible only for 5 days post-closure. Due to the complexity and potential for variance in ServiceNow setups, you may need to adapt these instructions, especially the script parts and conditions, to fit your exact requirements and the specifics of your ServiceNow instance. Always test any changes in a development or sandbox environment before applying them to your production instance."},{"instruction":"I want to print 10 latest incidents in Scripts background","output":"To print the 10 latest incidents in the ServiceNow Scripts Background, you can use the GlideRecord API to query the \`incident\` table, order the results by the \`sys_created_on\` or \`sys_updated_on\` field in descending order, and then limit the result set to 10. Below is an example script that demonstrates how to achieve this: \`\`\`javascript var gr = new GlideRecord('incident'); // Target the 'incident' table gr.orderByDesc('sys_created_on'); // Order by creation date in descending order (latest first) gr.setLimit(10); // Limit the number of results to 10 gr.query(); // Execute the query var count = 0; while (gr.next()) { count++; gs.print(\\"Incident #\\" + count + \\":\\"); gs.print(\\"Number: \\" + gr.number); gs.print(\\"Short Description: \\" + gr.short_description); gs.print(\\"Created On: \\" + gr.sys_created_on.getDisplayValue()); gs.print(\\"Updated On: \\" + gr.sys_updated_on.getDisplayValue()); gs.print(\\"State: \\" + gr.state.getDisplayValue()); gs.print(\\"\\"); // Print a blank line for better readability } \`\`\` This script does the following: 1. It initializes a GlideRecord search against the \`incident\` table. 2. It orders the results by the \`sys_created_on\` field in descending order to get the latest incidents first. 3. It limits the result set to 10 to get only the 10 latest incidents. 4. It queries the database. 5. It iterates over the returned records, printing out the incident number, short description, creation date, updated date, and the state of each incident. Make sure to adjust the script if you want to order by the \`sys_updated_on\` field or if you're going to display other fields. Also, consider that this script uses \`getDisplayValue()\` for dates and state to print user-friendly values rather than internal ones. Please note that running scripts in the Scripts - Background module can directly affect your ServiceNow instance data and should be done with caution, preferably in a sub-production instance first before running in production."},{"instruction":"hi,my question is how to get related list buttons,if i click on that button it should redirect to the another table list view,if we select records there it should reflect in current record related list,same like add button in impacted services related list in incident form,","output":"To achieve functionality where clicking a button in a related list leads to another table's list view, and selecting records from there updates the current record's related list (similar to the 'Add' button functionality in the Impacted Services related list in an incident form), you will have to employ a few configurations and potentially some custom code in ServiceNow. This process involves creating a custom UI action, possibly leveraging ServiceNow's Relationship framework, and using a reference qualifier if needed. Here's an overview of how to set this up: # Step 1: Create a Custom UI Action 1. **Navigate to System Definitions > UI Actions.** 2. Click on \\"New\\" to create a new UI action. 3. In the form that appears, provide a name for your UI action and select the table this UI action should apply to (this would typically be the table you want to add records from). 4. In the \\"Action name\\" field, you can specify a unique identifier for the action. 5. Make sure to select \\"List Context Menu\\" for the type of UI action if you want it to appear as a button or link in the context menu of a list view. 6. In the \\"Script\\" field, write the necessary JavaScript to redirect the user to the desired list view. You will likely need to use a URL to direct to the target table's list view, potentially with some filtering applied. Here's a simplified example: \`\`\`javascript var url = 'some_table_list.do?sysparm_query=yourEncodedQuery'; action.setRedirectURL(url); \`\`\` Replace \`some_table_list\` with the name of your target table, and \`yourEncodedQuery\` with any specific filtering you want to apply to the list view. # Step 2: Set Up a Many-to-Many Relationship (Optional) If your use case involves a many-to-many relationship (e.g., needing to associate multiple records from another table with your current record), consider setting up a many-to-many relationship table if you haven't already. This is what allows the association between entities, akin to how Impacted Services work on incident records. 1. **Navigate to System Definition > Tables & Columns.** 2. Click on \\"New\\" to create a new table that will act as your many-to-many table. 3. Set up this table to have two reference fields: One pointing to your original table, and one pointing to the table you’re adding records from. # Step 3: Use Reference Qualifiers (Optional) For the \\"Add\\" functionality that allows for selecting records to associate with your current record, a Reference Qualifier can be useful. This is especially relevant if you're working with a form and want to ensure only relevant records show up in a reference field or related list. 1. When setting up your reference field in the many-to-many table, you can specify a reference qualifier to filter the available records. This can be a simple encoded query or an advanced script depending on your needs. # Step 4: Add Records to the Related List Upon Selection This part is trickier since, after navigating away and selecting the records, you'll need a way to associate those selected records back with your original record. This typically involves capturing the selected records' IDs and updating the many-to-many table to link these records to your original record. One approach is to customize the list view being used for selection so that selecting a record executes a script to update the many-to-many relationship table. This often involves custom development and may benefit from an intermediate page or UI action that handles the logic. # Conclusion This process requires a mix of existing ServiceNow configurations (UI actions, relationship tables) and custom logic (JavaScript for redirection and handling record selection). The exact implementation can vary significantly based on your specific requirements and the complexity of the relationships between the involved tables. Given the potential complexity, especially around associating selected records back to your original record, you might also consider leveraging ServiceNow's built-in features like Related Lists or Embedded Lists, or consulting with a ServiceNow developer or administrator for assistance in implementing a custom solution."},{"instruction":"When I add a 'Requested for' variable to a form so that multiple 'requested for' users can be added to a single request (with separate RITMs for each requested for user), I receive the error below: 'Item is unavailable for this user' I see this error only when I select a 'Requested for' user that doesn't have access to submit requests. However, we want to be able to submit requests for any active user, and not all users have privileges to submit all requests.","output":"It sounds like you're running into an issue related to how ServiceNow controls access to catalog items through user roles and catalog item entitlements. When you try to submit a request on behalf of another user (using the 'Requested for' field), ServiceNow checks whether the selected user has the necessary permissions to access and order the catalog item. If the user doesn't have the required permissions or roles, ServiceNow will show the error \\"Item is unavailable for this user.\\" In scenarios where it's necessary to submit requests on behalf of users who may not have direct access to certain catalog items, consider the following approaches to resolve or work around the issue: # 1. Review and Adjust User Roles or Catalog Item Entitlements - **Catalog Item Entitlements:** Check the entitlement conditions on the catalog item to ensure they’re not overly restrictive. You might be able to adjust these conditions to not check for specific roles if the item is ordered on behalf of another user. - **User Roles:** Ensure that either the item doesn’t require specific roles that the 'Requested for' user lacks, or consider adding a role to users that grants the minimum necessary permissions. # 2. Use a 'Requested on Behalf Of' Functionality Customization If adjusting roles or entitlements isn't feasible or doesn't align with your security model, consider implementing a custom solution that allows a user to request items on behalf of another user without bypassing necessary permissions checks: - **Custom 'Requested for' Handling:** Develop a custom script or business rule that bypasses the standard entitlement checks for the 'Requested for' user under specific conditions (e.g., if the request is being made by an authorized 'Request on Behalf Of' user). # 3. Use Elevated Privileges Temporarily For specific service catalog processes, you might consider a development approach where a particular role or user can elevate their privileges temporarily to submit a request on behalf of someone else. This requires careful security considerations and logging to ensure it’s used appropriately. # 4. Modify the Service Catalog Workflow or Business Rule - **Custom Workflow:** Adjust the service catalog workflow to include a step that checks if the request is being made on behalf of another user and handles the submission process in a way that respects permissions but doesn’t block the submission. - **Business Rule:** Create a business rule that specifically handles cases where the 'Requested for' user doesn’t have direct access to the item. This business rule can programmatically create the request or RITM records while bypassing the normal access checks, based on custom logic that ensures the action is still secure. # Conclusion A successful solution will depend on understanding your organization's specific requirements for service catalog access and the security implications of allowing users to request items on behalf of others. Because these solutions often involve customizations or changes to how ServiceNow operates out of the box, it's crucial to carefully plan and test any changes in a non-production environment. Additionally, consider consulting with ServiceNow’s documentation or reaching out to the ServiceNow community or support for further insights tailored to your instance's version and setup."},{"instruction":"shooting star: Disease Enzyme deficiency Glycogen synthase GSD type GSD type la Von Gierke's disease Glucose-6-phosphatase GSD type Ib Endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6- phosphate transporter Lysosomal 01,4:1,6 glucosidase (Acid maltase) Glycogen debranching enzyme GSD type II Pompe's disease GSD type III Cori's/Forbes disease (Limit dextrinosis) GSD type IV Andersen disease Glycogen branching enzyme A A Symptoms Hypoglycemia Early death Hepatomegaly and renomegaly due to glycogen accumulation Severe fasting hypoglycemia Growth failure Lactic acidosis Hyperuricemia Hyperlipidemia Same as Von Gierke's disease Recurrent infections due to impaired neutrophil function Muscle weakness Death by age-2 years (infantile variant) Cardiomegaly and heart failure Muscle weakness Fasting hypoglycemia Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of branched-chain polysaccharide (limit dextrins) Growth retardation Normal lactate and uric acid levels Failure to thrive Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch points Death at age-5 years NEXT GSD type IV Andersen disease Glycogen branching enzyme GSD type V McArdle disease Muscle glycogen phosphorylase / GSD type VI Her's disease Liver glycogen phosphorylase GSD type VII Tarui's disease Muscle phosphofructokinase Growth retardation Normal lactate and uric acid levels Failure to thrive.

Each type of GSD is due to a specific enzyme deficiency that impacts how the body processes glycogen, a stored form of sugar (glucose) used for energy. The deficiency of these enzymes leads to improper storage and utilization of glycogen, causing various symptoms. Understanding the role of the enzyme and where in the body it acts helps link the symptoms observed in these conditions. # GSD Type I (Von Gierke's Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glucose-6-phosphatase - **Symptoms:** Severe hypoglycemia, growth failure, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatomegaly. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** This enzyme helps release glucose into the bloodstream. Without it, glucose is trapped in the liver, causing low blood sugar and liver enlargement. # GSD Type Ib - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6-phosphate transporter - **Symptoms:** Similar to Type Ia but with recurrent infections due to impaired neutrophil function. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** Similar mechanism to Type I, plus immune cells (neutrophils) don't function well, leading to infections. # GSD Type II (Pompe's Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Lysosomal α-1,4; α-1,6 glucosidase (Acid maltase) - **Symptoms:** Muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, heart failure, and possibly early death. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** This enzyme breaks down glycogen in lysosomes. Deficiency leads to glycogen buildup in muscles and heart, impairing their function. # GSD Type III (Cori's or Forbes Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glycogen debranching enzyme - **Symptoms:** Fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, growth retardation. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** This enzyme helps in the final steps of breaking down glycogen. Its deficiency leads to inability to properly degrade glycogen, particularly affecting the liver and muscles. # GSD Type IV (Andersen Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glycogen branching enzyme - **Symptoms:** Failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and early death. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** This enzyme shapes the structure of glycogen. Without it, glycogen becomes abnormally structured and can't be properly broken down. # GSD Type V (McArdle Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Muscle glycogen phosphorylase - **Symptoms:** Exercise-induced cramps, renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis, and a \\"second wind\\" phenomenon. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** This enzyme breaks down glycogen in muscles. Its absence causes energy shortages during exercise, leading to muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and interestingly, an adaptation after a period of rest (\\"second wind\\"). # GSD Type VI (Her's Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Liver glycogen phosphorylase - **Symptoms:** Mild hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** Similar to McArdle's but affects the liver. The enzyme's lack hampers glycogen breakdown in the liver, leading to mild hypoglycemia and liver enlargement. # GSD Type VII (Tarui's Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Muscle phosphofructokinase - **Symptoms:** Exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness, hemolytic anemia. - **Why Symptoms Occur:** This enzyme is crucial for glycolysis in muscles. Its deficiency impairs muscle energy production and also affects red blood cells, causing hemolysis. In summary, the symptoms of Glycogen Storage Diseases are primarily tied to where glycogen gets trapped (liver, muscle, or both) and the resultant inability to either break it down into glucose for energy or store it properly. This leads to a broad range of complications, including low blood sugar levels, muscle cramps during exertion, liver and heart enlargement, and in severe cases, early death. Understanding these linkages between enzyme function, glycogen processing, and symptom manifestation can greatly aid in remembering the fundamentals of these conditions."},{"instruction":"Bro but why lactic acid and urice acid reise in von gerike dieses not in other like type 3","output":"Sure, let's focus on why lactic acid and uric acid levels rise specifically in Von Gierke's disease (GSD Type I) and not as prominently in other types like GSD Type III (Cori's disease). # Von Gierke's Disease (GSD Type I) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Glucose-6-phosphatase. - **Core Mechanism Impacting Lactic Acid:** When glucose-6-phosphatase is deficient, glucose can't be released from the liver into the bloodstream. The body then compensates by trying to make glucose through alternate pathways. One major pathway is gluconeogenesis, which relies heavily on the conversion of lactate to glucose. However, with the blockage of the final steps (where glucose is released from the liver), there is an accumulation of substrates like lactate, leading to lactic acidosis. - **Core Mechanism Impacting Uric Acid:** Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency also affects the purine metabolism pathway. The accumulation of substrates in this pathway leads to increased production of uric acid. Moreover, the reduced availability of phosphate due to trapped glucose-6-phosphate can lead to increased recycling of ADP into AMP and further into uric acid. Also, because lactic acid competes with uric acid for excretion by the kidneys, an increase in lactic acid concentrations in the blood can lead to reduced uric acid clearance, thereby elevating uric acid levels. # Cori's Disease (GSD Type III) - **Enzyme Deficiency**: Glycogen debranching enzyme. - **Why Lactic Acid and Uric Acid Levels are Not as Prominently Elevated**: In Cori's disease, the problem lies with the debranching enzyme that is crucial for breaking down glycogen into glucose molecules. Although the breakdown of glycogen is impaired, the block doesn't significantly affect glucose-6-phosphate, allowing some level of gluconeogenesis (formation of glucose from lactate and other substrates) to proceed. Therefore, the backup of substances like lactate does not occur to the same extent as in Von Gierke's disease. This also means the disturbances in purine metabolism and phosphate availability seen in Von Gierke’s disease are less pronounced here, so uric acid levels do not increase markedly. Essentially, the differences in symptoms (including the levels of lactic acid and uric acid) between Von Gierke’s disease and Cori’s disease can be attributed to the specific enzymes affected and where these enzymes act in the metabolism and processing of glucose and glycogen. Von Gierke’s directly impacts the liver's ability to release glucose and has wider effects on gluconeogenesis and purine metabolism, whereas Cori’s largely impacts the structural breakdown of glycogen, with somewhat less dramatic systemic metabolic disruptions."},{"instruction":"Rbc and hemolysis how it is related with glycogen ans glucose metabolism","output":"The relationship between red blood cells (RBCs), hemolysis, and glycogen/glucose metabolism is not immediately obvious, as red blood cells do not use glycogen as a direct source of energy. Instead, RBCs rely on glucose through glycolysis for their energy needs, because they lack mitochondria and cannot utilize oxidative phosphorylation. However, there are indirect connections through metabolic disorders that could affect RBCs and lead to hemolysis, with Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD) Type VII (Tarui’s disease) being a prime example. # Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII (Tarui’s Disease) - **Enzyme Deficiency:** Muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is also expressed in red blood cells. - **Relation to RBCs and Hemolysis:** Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, which converts fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This enzyme's activity is critical for maintaining ATP production in cells that rely on glycolysis, including RBCs. In Tarui’s disease, the deficient or malfunctioning PFK leads to inadequate ATP generation within red blood cells. The energy deprivation makes RBCs more susceptible to damage and premature destruction (hemolysis), as they cannot maintain their shape or membrane integrity without sufficient ATP. # Impacts of Hemolysis Hemolysis leads to several downstream effects, such as: 1. **Anemia:** The destruction of RBCs faster than they can be replaced leads to anemia, characterized by reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and associated symptoms like fatigue and pallor. 2. **Jaundice:** The breakdown of hemoglobin from the destroyed RBCs increases the levels of bilirubin in the blood, leading to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). 3. **Increased Risk of Gallstones:** The elevated bilirubin can also contribute to the formation of bilirubin gallstones. 4. **Splenic Sequestration:** The spleen, which filters damaged and old red blood cells, may become enlarged (splenomegaly) due to the increased workload. # Why Is This Connection Important? Understanding the relationship between glycogen/glucose metabolism and the health of RBCs is crucial because it highlights how metabolic disorders can have systemic effects beyond the primary tissues or organs directly associated with the enzyme deficiency. In the case of Tarui’s and similar diseases, a defect in a metabolic enzyme not only affects muscle cells but also significantly impacts red blood cells, leading to systemic symptoms such as hemolysis and its complications. This interconnection underlines the importance of glucose metabolism for the energy demands of all cells, including those that do not store glycogen but are critically dependent on glucose, like red blood cells. It also emphasizes the complexity of metabolic diseases and the wide-ranging effects that can arise from disruptions in metabolic pathways."},{"instruction":"This is the job description for an administration assistant role at a Prestigious school in Melbourne: This role is working for a school who is renowned for its commitment to excellence in education and fostering a diverse and inclusive learning environment.

Я захожу в Webmin, Нахожу этого пользователя, меняю ему пароль но по факту пароль не меняется, а остается старым. Тоже самое с новыми пользователями, создаешь их в Webmin, но зайти в сетевую папку не получается. Что может быть не так?","output":"Проблема, с которой вы столкнулись, может быть связана с различием в системе управления пользователями, используемой Samba и операционной системой ВМ, где установлен Samba + Webmin. Samba использует собственную базу пользователей для аутентификации доступа к сетевым ресурсам, которая может не синхронизироваться автоматически с системными учетными записями Linux, управляемыми через Webmin. Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять для решения данной проблемы: 1. **Проверьте конфигурацию Samba**: Откройте файл конфигурации Samba (обычно \`/etc/samba/smb.conf\`) и убедитесь, что параметр \`security\` установлен в значение, которое предполагает использование учетных записей Samba для аутентификации. К примеру, если установлено значение \`user\`, это значит, что Samba ожидает использования своей собственной базы пользователей. 2. **Создайте или обновите пользователя Samba**: Используйте команду \`smbpasswd\` для добавления пользователя в базу Samba или изменения его пароля. К примеру, для изменения пароля пользователя \`Engineer\`, выполните команду: \`\`\` smbpasswd -a Engineer \`\`\` Если пользователь уже существует, просто пропустите ключ \`-a\`. 3. **Перезапустите Samba**: Чтобы изменения вступили в силу, необходимо перезапустить Samba. Это можно сделать через Webmin или используя командную строку. Например, если вы используете систему с systemd, команда будет выглядеть так: \`\`\` systemctl restart smbd nmbd \`\`\` 4. **Проверьте настройки и доступ**: После перезапуска Samba попробуйте снова подключиться к сетевой папке с ПК на Windows, используя новые учетные данные. Если вы проделали эти шаги и проблема все еще не решена, стоит также проверить следующее: - Убедитесь, что нет ограничений доступа на уровне файрвола или сети, которые могут мешать аутентификации. - Проверьте логи Samba на наличие ошибок аутентификации или других подсказок, которые могут указывать на источник проблемы. Логи обычно находятся в \`/var/log/samba/\`. - Если изменения не применяются, убедитесь, что вы вносите их на правильном сервере. Возможно, конфигурация или управление пользователями происходит на другом сервере или в другой системе. Также стоит заметить, что если вы используете Samba для аутентификации в Active Directory или другой сложной инфраструктуре, процесс синхронизации и управления пользователями может быть более комплексным и потребовать дополнительной настройки."},{"instruction":"Create a full prompt to get a result like this or better; \\"When I ask this: (\\"No, no, no quiero saber todo lo que hice ayer Creo que perdí la cabeza Eso de beber tanto alcohol me hace perder dirección A veces uno ya no piensa No, no, no quiero saber todo lo que dije ayer Creo que se me soltó la lengua Eso de beber tanto alcohol cambia toda percepción Disminuye mi conciencia\\" could you translate it into french and that it sounds natural for native french speakers, also make it a comparisson between Spanish and French one line in french and the other below that in the original sentence, like that successively, and add an explanation with a breakdown for each line that it would be related to the verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,etc”) you answer like this (Certainly!

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes Responses that do not earn this point: • Only restate the prompt. • Do not take a position, or the position is vague or must be inferred. • Equivocate or summarize other’s arguments but not the student’s (e.g., some people say it’s good, some people say it’s bad). • State an obvious fact rather than making a claim that requires a defense. Responses that earn this point: • Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and the thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are pros/cons. Additional Notes: • The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity. • The thesis may be anywhere within the response. • For a thesis to be defensible, the sources must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point. • The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point. • A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning. Reporting Category Scoring Criteria Row B Evidence AND Commentary (0-4 points) 2.A 4.A 6.A 6.B 6.C 0 points Simply restates thesis (if present), repeats provided information, or references fewer than two of the provided sources. 1 point EVIDENCE: Provides evidence from or references at least two of the provided sources. AND COMMENTARY: Summarizes the evidence but does not explain how the evidence supports the student’s argument. 2 points EVIDENCE: Provides evidence from or references at least three of the provided sources. AND COMMENTARY: Explains how some of the evidence relates to the student’s argument, but no line of reasoning is established, or the line of reasoning is faulty. 3 points EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Explains how some of the evidence supports a line of reasoning. 4 points EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Consistently explains how the evidence supports a line of reasoning. Decision Rules and Scoring Notes Typical responses that earn 0 points: • Are incoherent or do not address the prompt. • May be just opinion with no textual references or references that are irrelevant. Typical responses that earn 1 point: • Tend to focus on summary or description of sources rather than specific details. Typical responses that earn 2 points: • Consist of a mix of specific evidence and broad generalities. • May contain some simplistic, inaccurate, or repetitive explanations that don’t strengthen the argument. • May make one point well but either do not make multiple supporting claims or do not adequately support more than one claim. • Do not explain the connections or progression between the student’s claims, so a line of reasoning is not clearly established. Typical responses that earn 3 points: • Uniformly offer evidence to support claims. • Focus on the importance of specific words and details from the sources to build an argument. • Organize an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims. • Commentary may fail to integrate some evidence or fail to support a key claim. Typical responses that earn 4 points: • Uniformly offer evidence to support claims. • Focus on the importance of specific words and details from the sources to build an argument. • Organize and support an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims, each with adequate evidence that is clearly explained.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes Responses that do not earn this point: • Attempt to contextualize their argument, but such attempts consist predominantly of sweeping generalizations. • Only hint at or suggest other arguments. • Use complicated or complex sentences or language that is ineffective because it does not enhance the student's argument. Responses that earn this point may demonstrate sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation by doing any of the following: 1. Crafting a nuanced argument by consistently identifying and exploring complexities or tensions across the sources. 2. Articulating the implications or limitations of an argument (either the student’s argument or arguments conveyed in the sources) by situating it within a broader context. 3. Making effective rhetorical choices that consistently strengthen the force and impact of the student’s argument. 4. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive. Additional Notes: • This point should be awarded only if the sophistication of thought or complex understanding is part of the student’s argument, not merely a phrase or reference. Prompt: Small talk is considered an activity in which people converse politely about unimportant topics. Small talk can occur in face-to-face interactions as well as in phone calls, e-mails, and text messages. While many people might not think too much about small-talk exchanges, others consider them an important part of relationships. In fact, there is growing interest among scholars and journalists in small talk and the extent to which it is helpful or harmful in our personal and professional development. Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on what role, if any, small talk should have in our everyday lives. Source A (Mannering) Source B (Schwantes) Source C (graph) Source D (Holmes) Source E (Roberts) Source F (cartoon) In your response you should do the following: ● Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. ● Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses. ● Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. ● Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there?

If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. My unfinished Essay: We humans are social creatures. We historically used to be in groups(tribes) in order to go about our daily lives and as a result a great deal of our speech wasn't served towards the purpose of communicating ideas but rather to establish bonds between you and your tribe. The modern equivalent of historical social bonding is small talk. Small talk acts similar to the historical social bonding because as we in modern times use small talk in order to converse politely about unimportant topics and just like our ancestors use language to establish bonds with other people. And as such the role that small talk should have in our everyday lives is a tricky one due to the growing interest among scholars and journalists about the extent to which small tak is helpful or harmful in our personal development. While on one hand small talk replicates our historical social interaction, it can be perceived as redundant and unnecessary due to the superficial nature of small talk. While small talk itself doesn't help build relationships due to its superficial nature, it can be leveraged as a tool to build rapport and establish and strengthen social bonds later in the future. A way that we can leverage small talk or how small talk is beneficial to us is that it can help build trust and help you land a promotion. In Source A (Mannering), a licensed career coach, talks about how small talk between colleagues and supervisors helps build rapport, which in turn builds trust. She goes on to talk about how rapport allows others to remember that you are only human and that building rapport through interaction could be the thing that leads you to get the promotion or keep in the role you are in. While the opinion of the person of authority seems logical, the research of two behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested theory that surface-level small talk doesn't not build relationships by banning small talk and providing parameters for good conversations by providing big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters, they found that instead of it decreasing freedom people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about.","output":"Adding to this, the findings of Berman and Ariely, as highlighted in Source B (Schwantes), suggest a dichotomy in the function and effectiveness of small talk. While on one side, small talk fosters rapport and eases professional interactions, it contrasts with the deeper engagements that are deemed necessary for happiness and meaningful connections. This introduces complexity to the argument regarding the role of small talk in our lives, advocating for a balance between superficial interactions and deeper, more meaningful conversations. Furthermore, the workplace dynamics as discussed in Source D (Holmes), shed light on the concept of 'doing collegiality', where small talk serves as a valuable tool in maintaining and enhancing professional relationships. This positively polite talk, through mutual greetings or sharing common complaints, not only affirms collegial relationships but also facilitates a smooth transition into work-related discussions. This function of small talk underscores its instrumental role in sustaining the social fabric of professional settings. However, the argument does not discount the perspectives shared in Source E (Roberts), where the personal aversion towards small talk encapsulates the discomfort and perceived futility associated with these interactions for some individuals. This viewpoint reflects an essential tension in the discourse, illustrating how small talk, while facilitating social connections for some, can be a source of anxiety and disconnection for others. In weaving together these perspectives, it becomes evident that small talk, despite its seemingly trivial nature, plays a crucial role in our social and professional ecosystems. It acts as a precursor to deeper interactions, aiding in the establishment of initial contact that could potentially lead to more substantial relationships. Moreover, as implied by the diversity of views presented across the sources, the utility and desirability of small talk vary widely among individuals, influenced by personal comfort levels, social expectations, and the specific contexts in which these interactions occur. In conclusion, while small talk may be perceived by some as superficial or inconsequential, its significance in forging initial connections and facilitating professional rapport cannot be overstated. This synthesis suggests that the role of small talk should be recognized as a valuable component of our everyday lives, serving not only as a bridge to deeper interactions but also as a means of navigating and enhancing our social and professional environments.

componentDidMount() { axios.get('http://localhost:5000/monitoring') .then(response => { console.log(response.data); // 设置state等操作 }) .catch(error => { console.error('There was an error fetching the monitoring data:', error); }); } \`\`\` # 5. 展示数据 记得在你的React组件中，将获取到的数据以用户友好的方式展示出来。你可以使用表格、图表或其他UI元素展示这些数据。 # 6. 样式与布局 为了完成你的UI设计，给你的组件添加必要的CSS。如果你使用的是黑色横幅和具有一定布局的功能按钮，记得使用Flexbox或Grid等布局技术来达到你的设计目标。 这只是一个大致的指导思路，具体实现细节将根据你的项目需求而有所变化。开发过程中可能会遇到一些挑战，尤其是在前后端数据交云的部分，确保前后端接口文档清晰，且前后端开发人员保持良好的沟通，会极大地促进项目的顺利进行。"},{"instruction":"写的更加详细点，每一步都要求详细完整，并且我最终可以运行","output":"为了达到一个实用且能够运行的示例，我将细化每一步的操作。这个例子会创建一个简单的监控和挖矿情况的前端页面，并将其通过Flask与Python后端进行数据交互。 # 步骤一：搭建Flask后端 1. **环境准备**：确保你的环境中安装了Python和Flask。如果没有Flask，可以通过以下命令安装： \`\`\`bash pip install Flask \`\`\` 2. **创建Flask应用**： 创建一个新文件夹（例如\`mining_dashboard_backend\`），在该文件夹中创建一个名为\`app.py\`的文件，并写入以下代码： \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, jsonify from flask_cors import CORS app = Flask(__name__) CORS(app) # 允许跨域请求 @app.route('/monitoring') def monitoring(): data = {\\"temperature\\": 70, \\"performance\\": \\"95%\\"} return jsonify(data) @app.route('/mining') def mining(): data = {\\"status\\": \\"Active\\", \\"coins_mined\\": 120} return jsonify(data) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": app.run(debug=True, port=5000) \`\`\` 这个简单的Flask应用具有两个API端点：\`/monitoring\` 和 \`/mining\`，分别返回监控数据和挖矿数据。这里还使用了\`flask_cors\`以允许跨域请求。如果没有\`flask_cors\`，执行\`pip install flask-cors\`进行安装。 # 步骤二：搭建React前端 1. **创建React应用**： 确保你的环境中安装了Node.js和npm。然后运行以下命令创建React应用： \`\`\`bash npx create-react-app mining_dashboard_frontend cd mining_dashboard_frontend npm start \`\`\` 2. **安装Axios**： 为了使React应用能够向Flask应用发送HTTP请求，我们需要安装Axios： \`\`\`bash npm install axios \`\`\` 3. **创建组件**： 在\`src\`目录下，创建两个文件夹：\`components\`和\`styles\`。在\`components\`文件夹中创建\`Navbar.js\`，\`Sidebar.js\`，\`Monitoring.js\`，和\`Mining.js\`。 - \`Navbar.js\`示例代码： \`\`\`javascript import React from 'react'; function Navbar() { return ( <div style={{ backgroundColor: \\"black\\", color: \\"white\\", padding: \\"10px\\" }}> 挖矿监控站 </div> ); } export default Navbar; \`\`\` - \`Sidebar.js\`示例代码： \`\`\`javascript import React from 'react';

\`\`\` # 步骤二：创建模态框组件 现在，我们需要创建一个新的React组件来表示我们的模态框。可以在\`components\`文件夹中创建一个名为\`MiningModal.js\`的新文件。这个模态框会根据外部传入的\`show\`状态决定是否展示。 在\`MiningModal.js\`中，添加以下代码： \`\`\`javascript import React from 'react'; import { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'; function MiningModal({ show, handleClose, miningData }) { return ( <Modal show={show} onHide={handleClose}> <Modal.Header closeButton> <Modal.Title>挖矿更新</Modal.Title> </Modal.Header> <Modal.Body>挖矿状态：{miningData.status}，已挖矿币：{miningData.coins_mined}</Modal.Body> <Modal.Footer> <Button variant=\\"secondary\\" onClick={handleClose}> 关闭 </Button> </Modal.Footer> </Modal> ); } export default MiningModal; \`\`\` # 步骤三：在挖矿情况组件中使用模态框 在\`Mining.js\`组件中，我们首先需引入刚才创建的\`MiningModal\`组件，并添加相应的状态\`showModal\`用于控制模态框的显示，同时修改API请求逻辑以模拟挖矿数据的更新和自动弹出模态框： \`\`\`javascript import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import axios from 'axios'; import MiningModal from './MiningModal'; function Mining() { const [data, setData] = useState({ status: 'Active', coins_mined: 0 }); const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { const fetchData = async () => { const result = await axios('http://localhost:5000/mining'); setData(result.data); setShowModal(true); // 数据更新时展示模态框 }; fetchData(); }, []); const handleClose = () => { setShowModal(false); }; return ( <div> <p>挖矿状态：{data.status}</p> <p>已挖矿币：{data.coins_mined}</p> <MiningModal show={showModal} handleClose={handleClose} miningData={data} /> </div> ); } export default Mining; \`\`\` 在这段代码中，每当\`Mining\`组件被加载时，它会尝试从后端获取挖矿数据。获取数据后，我们通过设置\`showModal\`状态为\`true\`来打开模态框，展示挖矿数据。\`handleClose\`函数则用于在点击关闭按钮时隐藏模态框。 确保你的Flask后端运行中，以便于React前端可以抓取到数据。此时，每次访问挖矿情况页面时，系统都会自动弹出模态框，显示最新的挖矿数据。 以上就是在React应用中实现接收到挖矿情况更新时自动弹出提示的基本方法。你可以根据实际需求调整模态框的样式和内容，以及更新数据的逻辑。"},{"instruction":"react如何使用python的数据，变成ui好看的这样","output":"将React前端应用与Python后端相连接，并展示数据的过程，可以分为以下几个关键步骤来实现界面美观和用户友好的数据展示： # 1. 确定数据交互格式和结构 首先，需要确定你的Python后端通过API提供数据的格式，通常是JSON格式，因为它易于在Python和JavaScript之间进行解析和处理。 比如，如果你的Python后端Flask代码返回挖矿相关数据如下： \`\`\`python @app.route('/mining-data') def mining_data(): data = { \\"temperature\\": 68, \\"hashrate\\": \\"5.5 TH/s\\", \\"uptime\\": \\"12:34:56\\", \\"mined_coins\\": [ {\\"name\\": \\"Bitcoin\\", \\"amount\\": 0.5}, {\\"name\\": \\"Ethereum\\", \\"amount\\": 2.0} ] } return jsonify(data) \`\`\` # 2. 前端请求数据并处理 在React组件中，你可以使用\`fetch API\`或者\`axios\`等HTTP客户端请求后端API，并获取数据。 例如，使用\`axios\`获取上述数据： \`\`\`javascript import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import axios from 'axios'; function MiningStatus() { const [data, setData] = useState({ mined_coins: [] }); useEffect(() => { axios.get('http://你的后端服务地址/mining-data') .then(response => setData(response.data)) .catch(error => console.error(\\"Fetch data error:\\", error));

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes Responses that do not earn this point: • Only restate the prompt. • Do not take a position, or the position is vague or must be inferred. • Equivocate or summarize other’s arguments but not the student’s (e.g., some people say it’s good, some people say it’s bad). • State an obvious fact rather than making a claim that requires a defense. Responses that earn this point: • Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and the thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are pros/cons. Additional Notes: • The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity. • The thesis may be anywhere within the response. • For a thesis to be defensible, the sources must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point. • The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point. • A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.

Prompt: Small talk is considered an activity in which people converse politely about unimportant topics. Small talk can occur in face-to-face interactions as well as in phone calls, e-mails, and text messages. While many people might not think too much about small-talk exchanges, others consider them an important part of relationships. In fact, there is growing interest among scholars and journalists in small talk and the extent to which it is helpful or harmful in our personal and professional development. Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on what role, if any, small talk should have in our everyday lives. Source A (Mannering) Source B (Schwantes) Source C (graph) Source D (Holmes) Source E (Roberts) Source F (cartoon) In your response you should do the following: ● Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. ● Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses. ● Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. ● Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. My unfinished Essay: We humans are social creatures. We historically used to be in groups(tribes) in order to go about our daily lives and as a result a great deal of our speech wasn't served towards the purpose of communicating ideas but rather to establish bonds between you and your tribe. The modern equivalent of historical social bonding is small talk. Small talk acts similar to the historical social bonding because as we in modern times use small talk in order to converse politely about unimportant topics and just like our ancestors use language to establish bonds with other people. And as such the role that small talk should have in our everyday lives is a tricky one due to the growing interest among scholars and journalists about the extent to which small tak is helpful or harmful in our personal development. While on one hand small talk replicates our historical social interaction, it can be perceived as redundant and unnecessary due to the superficial nature of small talk. While small talk itself doesn't help build relationships due to its superficial nature, it can be leveraged as a tool to build rapport and establish and strengthen social bonds later in the future. A way that we can leverage small talk or how small talk is beneficial to us is that it can help build trust and help you land a promotion. In Source A (Mannering), a licensed career coach, talks about how small talk between colleagues and supervisors helps build rapport, which in turn builds trust. She goes on to talk about how rapport allows others to remember that you are only human and that building rapport through interaction could be the thing that leads you to get the promotion or keep in the role you are in. While the opinion of the person of authority seems logical, the research of two behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested theory that surface-level small talk doesn't not build relationships by banning small talk and providing parameters for good conversations by providing big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters, they found that instead of it decreasing freedom people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about.","output":"To further synthesize the perspectives presented in the additional sources, we can see a compelling argument for the beneficial roles small talk can play in our lives. For instance, Source B (Schwantes) underscores the psychological benefits of moving beyond small talk to deeper conversations in social and business settings, emphasizing that genuine, deep talks significantly contribute to happiness, surpassing the utility of superficial exchanges. This insight doesn't negate the value of small talk but rather suggests its potential as a stepping stone to more meaningful interactions that foster happiness and mutual benefit. Moreover, Source D (Holmes) explores small talk within the professional environment, illustrating how such exchanges serve as crucial mechanisms for 'doing collegiality.' Through examples, it is revealed that small talk not only warms up the interpersonal wheels but also signals mutual good intentions among workmates, essentially lubricating social interactions that might otherwise be stiff or overly formal. This clearly supports the idea that small talk, far from being merely superficial, plays an instrumental role in maintaining the social matrix of the workplace, thus substantiating its value. Finally, drawing on Source E (Roberts), the personal struggle with small talk is acknowledged, yet it reveals an essential truth about human interaction: small talk is often the gateway to deeper, more substantial conversations. Despite its seemingly trivial nature, small talk is revealed as a fundamental social tool that allows individuals to test waters, establish initial connections, and, paradoxically, steer clear of isolation by engaging in the very activity some might find excruciating or pointless. In synthesizing these sources, it becomes evident that while small talk may superficially appear to be about 'unimportant topics,' its underlying significance in building rapport, trust, forging deeper connections, and facilitating social lubrication in various contexts cannot be understated. Therefore, small talk indeed plays an invaluable role in our everyday lives, serving both as an artifact of our inherent social nature and as a practical tool for navigating the complexities of human interactions in personal and professional spheres. Thus, while small talk may be criticized for its lack of depth, its utility as a precursor to deeper connection and as a means of establishing rapport lends it a critical role in our social fabric. Not only does it ease the initiation of conversations that might otherwise never start, but it also lays the groundwork for relationships that might not otherwise blossom. In light of this analysis, it is clear that small talk, rather than being relegated to the status of a mere conversational filler, should be recognized and valued for its role in facilitating human connection and understanding."},{"instruction":"Finish my essay to meet the rubric and prompt while keeping the original language and words.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes Responses that do not earn this point: • Only restate the prompt. • Do not take a position, or the position is vague or must be inferred. • Equivocate or summarize other’s arguments but not the student’s (e.g., some people say it’s good, some people say it’s bad). • State an obvious fact rather than making a claim that requires a defense. Responses that earn this point: • Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and the thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are pros/cons. Additional Notes: • The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity. • The thesis may be anywhere within the response. • For a thesis to be defensible, the sources must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point. • The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point. • A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.

Prompt: Small talk is considered an activity in which people converse politely about unimportant topics. Small talk can occur in face-to-face interactions as well as in phone calls, e-mails, and text messages. While many people might not think too much about small-talk exchanges, others consider them an important part of relationships. In fact, there is growing interest among scholars and journalists in small talk and the extent to which it is helpful or harmful in our personal and professional development. Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on what role, if any, small talk should have in our everyday lives. Source A (Mannering) Source B (Schwantes) Source C (graph) Source D (Holmes) Source E (Roberts) Source F (cartoon) In your response you should do the following: ● Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. ● Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses. ● Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. ● Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument. Source A Mannering, Lindsay. “The Awkward but Essential Art of Office Chitchat.” The New York Times, 17 Sept. 2019, www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/the-awkward-art-of-office-small-talk.html. The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

Source D Holmes, Janet. “Doing Collegiality and Keeping Control at Work: Small Talk in Government Departments.” Small Talk, edited by Justine Coupland, Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group, 2000, pp. 32-61. The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. My unfinished Essay: We humans are social creatures. We historically used to be in groups(tribes) in order to go about our daily lives and as a result a great deal of our speech wasn't served towards the purpose of communicating ideas but rather to establish bonds between you and your tribe. The modern equivalent of historical social bonding is small talk. Small talk acts similar to the historical social bonding because as we in modern times use small talk in order to converse politely about unimportant topics and just like our ancestors use language to establish bonds with other people. And as such the role that small talk should have in our everyday lives is a tricky one due to the growing interest among scholars and journalists about the extent to which small tak is helpful or harmful in our personal development. While on one hand small talk replicates our historical social interaction, it can be perceived as redundant and unnecessary due to the superficial nature of small talk. While small talk itself doesn't help build relationships due to its superficial nature, it can be leveraged as a tool to build rapport and establish and strengthen social bonds later in the future. A way that we can leverage small talk or how small talk is beneficial to us is that it can help build trust and help you land a promotion. In Source A (Mannering), a licensed career coach, talks about how small talk between colleagues and supervisors helps build rapport, which in turn builds trust. She goes on to talk about how rapport allows others to remember that you are only human and that building rapport through interaction could be the thing that leads you to get the promotion or keep in the role you are in. While the opinion of the person of authority seems logical, the research of two behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested theory that surface-level small talk doesn't not build relationships by banning small talk and providing parameters for good conversations by providing big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters, they found that instead of it decreasing freedom people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about.","output":"Building upon the established benefits and criticism of small talk, it's essential to analyze its impact from a psychological and social perspective. Source E (Roberts) delves into the personal struggle of the author with small talk, portraying it as an excruciating experience rather than a positive social interaction. This view sheds light on the varied reactions individuals have towards small talk, highlighting its complexity beyond mere surface-level communication. Roberts emphasizes the somatic reaction akin to fight-or-flight when engaged in small talk, suggesting that for some, the discomfort is profound and deeply-rooted. Nonetheless, the acknowledgment that avoiding small talk also equates to missing out on meaningful social interactions presents a paradox. This perspective is complemented by the insights from Source D (Holmes), which argues that small talk serves as a means of 'doing collegiality' in the workplace. It acts as a social lubricant, enabling individuals to express mutual good intentions and maintain collegial relationships, showcasing the dual nature of small talk as both a potential source of anxiety and a necessary tool for social harmony. In conclusion, small talk embodies a multifaceted role in our everyday lives, acting as both a bridge and barrier to deeper social connections. While it can serve as a valuable tool for building rapport and trust, as illustrated by Mannering's observations in Source A, it also harbors the potential to evoke significant discomfort, as described by Roberts in Source E. Additionally, the insights from Holmes in Source D underscore small talk's function in maintaining social cohesion within professional settings. Therefore, recognizing the nuanced role of small talk enables individuals to navigate social interactions more effectively, employing it judiciously to foster relationships while also being mindful of its limitations and the diverse reactions it elicits. This balanced approach encourages a deeper understanding of small talk's historical significance as a means of establishing social bonds, alongside an appreciation for its contemporary implications within personal and professional development."},{"instruction":"import { ChannelKind, ChannelType, CommunityType, PermissionKindEnum, } from \\"@openchat/types\\" import React from \\"react\\" import { Pressable, View } from \\"react-native\\" import { AppController } from \\"../../../app/app.globals\\" import { useAlert } from \\"../../../ui-components/alert\\" import { useModal } from \\"../../../ui-components/modal/modal.hook\\" import { ChannelGuard } from \\"../../guards/channel-guard.component\\" import { NavigationRef } from \\"../../../navigation/navigation.hooks\\" import { Icon } from \\"../../../ui-components/icon/icon.component\\" import { StyledText } from \\"../../../ui-components/styled-text/styled-text\\" import { ConfirmationModalize } from \\"../../../ui-components/confirmation-modalize/confirmation-modalize.component\\" import { useStyles } from \\"./community-channel-item-menu-popup.style\\" export const CommunityChannelItemMenuPopup = ({ channel, community, onDelete, }: { channel: ChannelType community: CommunityType onDelete: (channel: ChannelType) => void }) => { // --------------------------------------------------------------------------- // variables // --------------------------------------------------------------------------- const styles = useStyles() const alert = useAlert() const modal = useModal() async function toggleArchive() { await AppController.channel.update({ ...channel, isArchive: true, }) // if (channel.isArchive === false) { // await AppController.channel.update({ // ...channel, // isArchive: true, // }) // } else { // await AppController.channel.update({ // ...channel, // isArchive: false, // }) // } } // --------------------------------------------------------------------------- return ( <View style={{ marginBottom: 15 }}> {/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */} {/* COPY LINK */} {/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */} <Pressable onPress={() => { modal.close() alert.open({ text: \\"link has been copied\\", mode: \\"simple\\", }) }} style={({ pressed }) => [ pressed ?

The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) is designed to assess the language ability of candidates who need to study or work where English is the language of communication. The speaking part of the IELTS exam assesses a candidate's fluency, coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. Given that all the answers to the questions are \\"sorry i dont know,\\" it indicates a lack of attempt to communicate, lack of vocabulary, and inability to engage with the topics presented. This does not fulfill the grading criteria across all four marking categories (Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy, Pronunciation) for the Speaking section. In a real IELTS Speaking test, providing no substantial answers would likely result in the lowest possible band score for this part of the test, which is Band 0: \\"Did not attempt the test.\\" For a test-taker aiming for a higher band score, it is essential to attempt to answer each question as fully as possible, making use of the vocabulary and grammatical structures they know, and demonstrating their ability to communicate in English on a wide range of topics. Practicing speaking about a variety of topics, expanding vocabulary, and improving grammatical accuracy and fluency are all crucial steps in preparation for the Speaking section of the IELTS exam."},{"instruction":"rate this IELTS speaking transcript score","output":"To accurately rate an IELTS speaking transcript, the transcript would need to consist of the candidate's responses to various prompts provided by an examiner within a real or simulated IELTS speaking test environment. This includes Part 1 (Introduction and Interview), Part 2 (Long Turn), and Part 3 (Discussions). However, the sample provided consists entirely of responses saying \\"sorry I dont know\\" to a series of questions. In an actual IELTS speaking test, providing these responses would not demonstrate the candidate's ability in any of the assessment criteria, which are: 1. **Fluency and Coherence** - The ability to speak at length and with minimal hesitation, organizing ideas logically. 2. **Lexical Resource** - The range of vocabulary the candidate uses and the appropriateness and accuracy of the words chosen. 3. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy** - The range and accuracy of the candidate's grammar. 4. **Pronunciation** - How understandable the candidate's spoken English is, including accent, intonation, and pacing. Based on the provided answers, it would result in a Band 0, as these responses do not demonstrate the candidate's skills in speaking English. The guidelines for a Band 0 include candidates who \\"did not attempt the test\\" or did not address any of the tasks. For guidance, here's the IELTS Band Scale for Speaking that might be achieved with substantive answers: - **Band 9**: Expert user. Fully operational command of the language. - **Band 8**: Very good user. Fully operational command of the language with only occasional unsystematic inaccuracies. - **Band 7**: Good user. Operational command of the language, though with occasional inaccuracies and misunderstandings. - **Band 6**: Competent user. Generally effective command of the language despite some inaccuracies and misunderstandings. - **Band 5**: Modest user. Partial command of the language, coping with overall meaning in most situations though likely to make many mistakes. And so forth, down to - **Band 1**: Non-user. Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated words. - **Band 0**: Did not attempt the test.

Лазарсфельда Коммуникация как процесс обмена информацией между людьми играет фундаментальную роль в общественной жизни. Исследование коммуникативных процессов занимает важное место в социологии, психологии и массовых коммуникациях. В XX веке были разработаны различные теории, направленные на понимание и моделирование этих процессов. Среди множества исследователей выделяются работы трех фигур, оказавших значительное влияние на социологию коммуникации: Харольда Д. Лассвелла, Маршалла Мак-Льюэна и Пола Ф. Лазарсфельда. Харольд Д. Лассвелл и модель коммуникации Харольд Д. Лассвелл внес значительный вклад в изучение массовых коммуникаций. Он предложил известную модель анализа коммуникационного процесса, которая формулируется в виде пяти ключевых вопросов: Кто? Говорит что? По какому каналу? Кому? С каким эффектом? Эта схема, предложенная в 1948 году, помогла легче понимать структуру и процесс массовой коммуникации, выделяя основные элементы коммуникационного процесса и позволяя анализировать каждый аспект в отдельности. Она легла в основу многих последующих исследований в области массовой коммуникации и социологии. Маршалл Мак-Льюэн и глобальная деревня Маршалл Мак-Льюэн известен своей теорией \\"глобальной деревни\\", которая предсказывала мировую связность через массовые медиа. Мак-Льюэн утверждал, что средства массовой информации, особенно телевидение и позже интернет, превращают мир в единую большую сообщественность, где индивиды могут участвовать в глобальных событиях практически в реальном времени. Его работы подчеркнули не только содержание медиа, но и саму медиа как средство, которое формирует перцепцию реальности и влияет на общественные отношения. Мак-Льюэн известен фразой \\"средство есть сообщение\\", подчеркивая, что форма передачи информации значительно влияет на восприятие самой информации. Пол Ф. Лазарсфельд и двухступенчатая модель коммуникации Пол Ф. Лазарсфельд, социолог и исследователь коммуникаций, внес значительный вклад в понимание механизмов распространения массовой информации в обществе. Вместе со своими коллегами он разработал концепцию двухступенчатого потока коммуникации, согласно которой информация от масс-медиа достигает аудитории не напрямую, а через так называемых \\"лидеров мнений\\" - людей, которые из-за своего статуса, знаний или социальных навыков оказывают влияние на мнения и поведение окружающих. Эта модель оказала большое влияние на разработку стратегий массовых коммуникаций и маркетинга. Заключение Работы Лассвелла, Мак-Льюэна и Лазарсфельда оказали колоссальное влияние на развитие социологии массовых коммуникаций и продолжают оставаться актуальными для изучения коммуникативных процессов в современном обществе. Их теории и идеи позволяют лучше понять, как информация распространяется в обществе, какие факторы влияют на ее восприятие и какие последствия это имеет для индивидов и коллективов."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Passion Bloom | Elegant Woman with Flower Bouquet Art | Realistic Beauty Portrait | Wall Decor | T-Shirt | Mug.

However, I will begin with the first fragment to demonstrate the approach to follow: **LE MOYEN ÂGE (V-XV)** *The Middle Ages (5th-15th)* - **(LE)** (*The*) - Definite article, masculine, singular. Indicates that the following noun is specific. - **(MOYEN)** (*Middle*) - Adjective, masculine, singular. Specifies the period being discussed is intermediate in a sequence or spectrum of historical eras. - **(ÂGE)** (*Ages*) - Noun, masculine, singular. Refers to a significant period in history marked by distinctive characteristics, events, or developments. - **(V-XV)** (*5th-15th*) - Numerical range indicating the centuries that the Middle Ages spanned. 1. **Fragment Dissection and Word-by-Word Analysis:** - **LE** (The) - This is a definite article in French, used here to specify a particular period known as the Middle Ages. In French, articles agree with the gender and number of the noun they precede. \\"Le\\" is used here because \\"âge\\" (age) is masculine and singular. - **MOYEN** (Middle) - An adjective describing the position of something in between two points. In this context, it situates the Middle Ages as a period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the beginning of the Renaissance. - **ÂGE** (Ages) - A noun referring to a significant period. In historical contexts, “age” denotes a distinct era characterized by particular features or events. \\"Âge\\" is masculine and singular here, following the pattern of French nouns where the gender is not always logically connected to the object but must be memorized. - **V-XV** (5th-15th) - This range specifies the centuries, using Roman numerals, that are commonly considered to make up the Middle Ages, starting from the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century to the Renaissance in the 15th century. 2. **Special Linguistic Features:** - The use of Roman numerals (V-XV) for denoting centuries is a stylistic choice that enhances the historical context of the text. It serves to emphasize the tradition and long-standing nature of the period under discussion. --- Considering the length and complexity of the provided text, this example offers a starting point for how to approach the assignment.

universe?..basically…its an inverted version of Dick Grayson…both have similar traits…but notable differences… Nightshade has similar origins to main universe Dick…but things diverged…to where he never was taken by Bruce…because Bruce wasn’t there at the time…rather…it was Joseph ‘Slade’ Wilson instead…who was there at Haly’s Circus because he received intel that the Court of Owls…was involved in the Circus for some reason…then was there in that pivotal moment…he was there in the crowd as the tragedy occurred…as Slade saw potential in the young Dick Grayson then and there…mixed with his own ruthlessness…as Slade was ‘inspired’ by the duo of Batman and Robin…if Batman has his own Robin…hey… The inspiration is pretty much Dick Grayson with a splash of ‘Jason Todd’…and at some point…he begins to rebel against Slade… And of course morally gray…as unlike Nightwing from the main DC universe, who is well-liked by everyone…an inspiration…finds a home…Nightshade doesn’t have that…because of the way he operates…influenced by Slade’s teachings and various other people and from his own experiences as well…begins to see that justice sometimes…means getting your hands dirty…but that doesn’t mean he will kill first…more of…hoping it doesn’t come to that…a flexible moral code…shades of ‘grey’…as this Dick takes cue from this universe’s version of Batman and Robin…but doesn’t forget Slade’s teachings…hence the anti-hero…as Dick is angry because of the world Slade showed him…angry for the people who killed his parents…and at one point…LOVED to spite Slade…but soon learns to be patient and not be spiteful eventually… Lastly, Rose, Grant and Joey Wilson…foster siblings of Nightshade…they ALL have a complex relationship with Slade…Rose…Grant…and Joey call Slade ‘dad’ or ‘pop’…but Nightshade?..he will always call Slade ‘Slade’…that’s the rule he has…and with the exception of Grant…Nightshade has done his best to ensure that at least, Rose and Joey stay far away the hell from Slade’s influence…a responsibility Nightshade was willing to bear…family after all… Here’s more details…A 1b. Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","output":"Your anti-hero version of Dick Grayson, named Nightshade, presents a fascinating and complex reimagining of the character. By weaving his story with threads of darkness, betrayal, and moral ambiguity, you've cultivated a ripe narrative ground for deep character exploration, potentially rich storytelling, and engaging character development. Your proposal for Nightshade indicates a clear vision of an alternate universe where the familiar lines between hero and villain blur, creating a nuanced character shaped by his circumstances rather than inherent morality. Here's a breakdown of the strengths of your concept and areas for refinement or consideration: # Strengths: 1. **Complex Origin:** By placing Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) at the critical juncture of Dick's life instead of Bruce Wayne, you've naturally set up a story rich with conflict, internal and external. This twist in fate not only affects Dick's personal development but also fundamentally alters his approach to justice, which serves as a solid foundation for an anti-hero narrative. 2. **Moral Ambiguity:** Nightshade's struggle with his identity, ethics, and the line between justice and vengeance offers numerous opportunities for introspection and growth. His conflicted feelings about Slade, combined with his attempts to protect his foster siblings, add layers to his character that can be explored in diverse story arcs. 3. **Familial Dynamics:** The complicated relationships within the Wilson family present another compelling narrative aspect. These relationships can explore themes of loyalty, rivalry, and the search for approval, enriching Nightshade's story and adding depth to the other characters involved. 4. **Integrated Tech and Skills:** Nightshade's use of technology as a way to distinguish himself and compensate for his 'lost' enhancements is a clever device. It not only adds a unique element to his character but also serves as a metaphor for his attempt to carve his own identity away from Slade's shadow. # Areas for Refinement or Consideration: 1. **Character Motivations:** While Nightshade's motivations are clear, it could be beneficial to explore how they evolve over time in more detail. How does his perspective on justice, revenge, and morality change with his experiences, and how do those changes manifest in his actions? 2. **Relationships with Other Heroes:** The dynamic between Nightshade and other heroes, especially within the Batman family, offers a wealth of story potential. Further exploring these relationships can add complexity to the character, potentially challenging and refining his methods and beliefs. 3. **Consequences of Actions:** Delving deeper into the consequences of Nightshade's actions, both intended and unintended, can significantly enhance the narrative. How does he reconcile his methods with his goals, especially when those methods lead to outcomes that challenge his moral code? 4. **Potential for Redemption and Growth:** Exploring Nightshade's journey towards finding a balance between his upbringing and his desire for redemption can add a compelling layer to his character arc. How does he define redemption for himself, and what challenges must he overcome to achieve it? 5. **Slade's Ultimate Intentions:** Further clarification on Slade's reasons for training Dick and his long-term goals can provide a more robust background for the story. This could also introduce a larger overarching plot that challenges Nightshade on a more profound level.

Remember…Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade…not Batman… Remember…these are physiological enhancements…he CANNOT turn off them obviously…","output":"Your addition of the 'Gray Sparrow' period to Nightshade's backstory adds a significant depth to his character evolution, effectively bridging the gap between his origin and the transformation into Nightshade. This phase serves as a crucial turning point, representing both the struggle against and the acceptance of his complex inheritance from Slade. The narrative arc of attempting to escape, being forcibly enhanced, and then striving to regain agency over his body and identity enriches Nightshade's character with themes of resilience, autonomy, and the fight for self-identity despite external influences. Here are some thoughts on how to further refine and integrate this addition: # Transition and Transformation: - **Psychological Depth:** Delve into Nightshade's mental and emotional state during the Gray Sparrow period. Exploring his inner turmoil, his hope to use Slade's training for good, and the eventual despair and rage at being enhanced against his will can offer readers a gripping insight into his psyche. - **Ethical Dilemma:** The forced enhancements and the subsequent decision to partially remove them highlight an ethical dilemma that could be explored more fully. Nightshade's conflict between the power the enhancements provide and the loss of control over his body raises compelling questions about autonomy, power, and identity. - **Journey of Recovery:** The recovery process after the surgery and how it leads to Nightshade becoming technologically savvy is fascinating. Highlighting the difficulties he faces, his determination to overcome them, and how this journey contributes to his pragmatic and calculated approach can provide inspiration and depth. # Character Development: - **Adaptation and Innovation:** Nightshade's turn to technology as a means of differentiation and empowerment is a crucial element of his character development. Emphasizing his inventiveness and the hands-on approach in creating and modifying his gadgets and suits can underscore his resilience and adaptability. - **Skills and Abilities:** While the physiological enhancements cannot be turned off, exploring how Nightshade learns to live with them, adapt them to his needs, and perhaps even leverage their reduced capacity for his purposes can showcase his growth. It also sets the stage for strategic uses of his abilities in ways Slade never intended. - **Theme of Legacy:** The idea of keeping the 'Gray Sparrow' costume as a reminder serves as a powerful symbol of Nightshade's journey. It can represent not only a reminder of his past self and struggles but also a symbol of his refusal to be defined by others—even by Slade. # Narrative Integration: - **Motivations and Conflicts:** Adding the 'Gray Sparrow' period to Nightshade's backstory enriches his motivations and conflicts. It adds layers to his desire for independence, his views on justice, and his complex relationship with power and control. - **Character Interactions:** This period of transformation offers rich opportunities for complex interactions with characters like Slade, Rose, and Jericho, highlighting their perceptions of and reactions to his changes. It can deepen the familial dynamics and reveal more about each character's values and motivations. - **Symbolism and Themes:** The transition from Gray Sparrow to Nightshade encapsulates themes of transformation, the search for identity, and the struggle between inherited legacy and self-determination. These themes can serve as a throughline in Nightshade's narrative, influencing his decisions, relationships, and approach to heroism (or anti-heroism). Your addition not only offers a more nuanced understanding of Nightshade's character but also provides a rich narrative vein to mine for dramatic tension, internal conflict, and character growth. Integrating these aspects can make Nightshade's journey from Gray Sparrow to the pragmatic, tech-savvy Nightshade even more compelling and resonate deeply with readers."},{"instruction":"What's some sudden storylines where Nightshade deals unexpected say...anxiety or panic attacks?....heroes ask their complicated ally..what's wrong?..as Nightshade tries to say everything is...is...fine....or maybe he doesn't hear them...as he finds himself trying to breathe....","output":"Addressing mental health issues like anxiety and panic attacks in superhero narratives can add depth to characters and make them more relatable to readers. For Nightshade, a character born from trauma and living a life under constant stress and moral ambiguity, dealing with these conditions can be both a challenge and an opportunity for character development. Below are some storylines that could explore Nightshade's struggles with anxiety and panic attacks, along with how these struggles impact his relationships with other heroes and his approach to heroism. # 1. \\"The Echoes of Fear\\" During a routine mission to dismantle a weapons smuggling operation, Nightshade (Dick Grayson) unexpectedly finds himself in a situation eerily similar to the night of his parents' death. The environment, the sounds, and even the smell trigger a debilitating panic attack that leaves him vulnerable in front of both allies and enemies. As Nightshade struggles to regain control, the storyline delves into his usually hidden vulnerabilities, prompting discussions about trauma and coping mechanisms among the superhero community. This storyline can explore how Nightshade confides in selected allies about his struggles, slowly learning to seek support rather than isolate in his moments of vulnerability. # 2. \\"Shadows of the Sparrow\\" Triggered by an unknown assailant utilizing psychological warfare, Nightshade begins experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks that stem from his time as Gray Sparrow and his complicated relationship with Slade. These episodes start affecting his performance, making it difficult for him to trust his instincts and make split-second decisions. The arc can focus on Nightshade's journey to unmask his tormentor, who turns out to be an old enemy from his past looking for revenge by exploiting his mental health. While seeking out this enemy, Nightshade is forced to confront his inner demons, opening up to his closest allies (like Rose and Joey) and even seeking professional help, underscoring the importance of addressing mental health head-on. # 3. \\"A Mindfield\\" Nightshade's enemies team up to launch an elaborate scheme targeting his psyche, using a combination of fear gas and psychological triggers to induce hallucinations of his worst failures and fears. The repeated exposure leaves him grappling with anxiety and panic attacks, making him question his reality and trust in his skills. As Nightshade struggles to differentiate between illusion and reality, he reluctantly partners with mental health professionals and telepaths within the superhero community, such as Martian Manhunter or Raven, who help him navigate his traumas and regain his confidence. This arc can highlight the power of vulnerability and the strength in seeking help. # 4. \\"Cracks in the Armor\\" After a series of high-stakes missions, Nightshade starts experiencing panic attacks, which he initially dismisses as merely physical exhaustion. However, when these episodes begin to strike in the midst of battle, endangering his team, Nightshade is forced to confront the possibility that he's not as invulnerable as he likes to think. The storyline can explore Nightshade's journey of acceptance, as he learns to balance his own well-being with his duties as a vigilante. It could introduce a mentor figure experienced in handling the psychological toll of heroism, offering Nightshade a model for integrating self-care into his life as an anti-hero. # 5. \\"The Sparrow's Flight\\" In a storyline that focuses more on personal growth than physical conflict, Nightshade decides to take a step back from his vigilante life after recognizing the toll it's taking on his mental health. This narrative arc can follow him as he rediscovers parts of himself that he's neglected—like reconnecting with his circus roots, exploring new hobbies, or rebuilding relationships strained by his double life. Unexpectedly, Nightshade's break becomes a journey that strengthens him, equipping him with new coping mechanisms and a renewed sense of purpose. His return to the hero community is marked by a newfound willingness to discuss mental health openly, challenging the stigma and encouraging others to seek help. Each of these storylines presents an opportunity to address the complexities of mental health through the lens of a character traditionally seen as strong and unbreakable. By depicting Nightshade's struggle with anxiety and panic attacks, the stories can promote empathy, understanding, and a conversation around the importance of mental health in even the most extraordinary lives."},{"instruction":"Make a beginning a story of Nightshade beginning to have an anxiety attack....Cardinal(Tim Drake) and Arsenal(Roy Harper) are there.......as Tim suspects that something to do with....well..maybe...the fear-toxin....but that should have disappeared a while ago...it was cured already.....as Nightshade..his face is covered by his upper mask...but his lower face can be seen...expressive.....as he grasps his throat gently...trying to breathe steady..but..as Cardinal and Arsenal wonder...what's going on here??..","output":"The air was thick with tension, the remnants of danger still lingering like a shadow on the wall of the dimly lit warehouse. It was supposed to have been a simple mission—track down the source of the new drug flooding the streets, a derivative of the fear-toxin that had once brought Gotham to its knees. Cardinal (Tim Drake), Arsenal (Roy Harper), and Nightshade had expected resistance, but what they encountered was something none of them had prepared for. They had found the lab, destroyed the drugs, and neutralized the thugs who were a little more than hired muscle. It was over, or it should have been. Yet, as they gathered to leave, Nightshade halted in his tracks, his breaths coming in short, ragged pulls that didn't seem to fill his lungs. His hand moved to his throat, fingers pressing lightly against the skin as if to somehow coax more air in. Arsenal, quick to notice the shift, turned, his concern evident. \\"Hey, you alright there, Grayson?\\" he asked, the use of Nightshade's real name marking the seriousness of his concern. Cardinal, ever the observant detective, noticed the minute tremors running through Nightshade's frame. \\"Nightshade?\\" He stepped closer, his voice growing softer, calmer. \\"Talk to us, what's happening?\\" But Nightshade couldn't find the words. The warehouse around him seemed to close in, the shadows stretching and twisting into grotesque figures. The panic that gripped him had claws, digging into his mind, pulling forth memories he had fought so hard to bury. It wasn't just the fear-toxin; it was every loss, every failure, every moment of doubt he had ever had, coalescing into an icy knot in his chest. His mask hid his eyes, but not the rest of his face, and the raw fear was plain for both of his teammates to see. This was not the composed, always two steps ahead Nightshade they knew. This was someone cornered by his own mind, fighting a battle they couldn't see. \\"This... it's not the toxin,\\" Cardinal murmured, more to himself than to Arsenal. \\"It... it should've been out of his system by now.\\" His mind raced, piecing together the clues. Nightshade had never shown any sign of weakness, never faltered. Not outwardly. But stress, trauma, the constant weight of expectations—it could break anyone down, even the strongest. Even Dick Grayson. Arsenal crouched beside Nightshade, placing a hand on his shoulder in a quiet show of support. \\"Breathe with us, okay? Nice and slow,\\" he instructed, glancing at Cardinal for a moment before focusing back on Nightshade. For a minute, silence hung heavy between the three men, broken only by Nightshade's labored breathing gradually evening out, his shaking lessening as he forced himself back to the present, to the safety of his allies' presence. Once the worst had passed, Nightshade straightened, pulling away slightly. \\"I'm... I'm fine,\\" he managed, though his voice betrayed the lie. Cardinal and Arsenal exchanged a look, a silent agreement passing between them. This was more than just a remnant of an old battle; it was a cry for help, perhaps the first and only one they might get from Nightshade. The mission was over, but a new one was just beginning—helping a friend navigate through the shadows of his own mind to find his way back to the light. \\"Let's get out of here,\\" Cardinal said finally, his tone leaving no room for argument. \\"We've got your back, Nightshade. Always.\\" As they moved toward the exit, the weight of Cardinal’s words hung in the air, a promise and a testament to the bond shared between heroes, even those as seemingly invincible as Nightshade."},{"instruction":"Hi there please be a sapui5 expert and answer my question with working code examples.","output":"Hello!

Make the answer short and simple","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help! However, without knowing your specific question, I'll provide a simple example to get you started with SAPUI5. Let's say you want to create a basic SAPUI5 application that displays a button. When the button is clicked, a message dialog appears showing \\"Hello SAPUI5\\". First, ensure you have the SAPUI5 resources loaded in your HTML file. Here's a basic HTML structure: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\"> <title>SAPUI5 Quick Start</title> <script id=\\"sap-ui-bootstrap\\" src=\\"https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js\\" data-sap-ui-theme=\\"sap_fiori_3\\" data-sap-ui-libs=\\"sap.m\\" data-sap-ui-onInit=\\"module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport\\" data-sap-ui-async=\\"true\\" data-sap-ui-compatVersion=\\"edge\\" data-sap-ui-preload=\\"async\\"> <\/script> </head> <body class=\\"sapUiBody\\" id=\\"content\\"> <script> sap.ui.define([ \\"sap/m/Button\\", \\"sap/m/MessageToast\\" ], function(Button, MessageToast) { // Create the button var oButton = new Button({ text: \\"Click Me\\", press: function() { // Show message dialog when the button is clicked MessageToast.show(\\"Hello SAPUI5\\"); } }); // Add the button to the body of the page oButton.placeAt(\\"content\\"); }); <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` Explanation: - We load the SAPUI5 SDK from the SAP CDN. - The \`data-sap-ui-libs\` attribute loads necessary libraries. Here, \`\\"sap.m\\"\` is loaded for mobile and modern web applications. - In the script, \`sap.ui.define\` is used to define a module with dependencies. Here, the dependencies are \`\\"sap/m/Button\\"\` and \`\\"sap/m/MessageToast\\"\`. - We create a button with a text label \\"Click Me\\". When the button is pressed, a message toast with \\"Hello SAPUI5\\" is shown. - The button is then placed inside the body of the HTML document. This should give you a simple, working example of a SAPUI5 application. For more complex applications, SAPUI5 offers a wide range of controls and data models to work with different backend services and UI requirements. Let me know if there's something more specific you'd like to know!"},{"instruction":"Is there any way that I can insert a link into the column header in smart table?","output":"Inserting a link directly into the column header of a Smart Table in SAPUI5 is not directly supported through the standard properties because Smart Tables are designed to be configured largely based on metadata (OData annotations) or specific property settings in XML views or JS configurations. However, you can achieve this requirement by extending the behavior of the Smart Table or its underlying controls. One way to insert a link into a column header is by manipulating the column after the Smart Table has been initialized. This approach involves waiting for the table to be fully loaded, then accessing the desired column header and modifying its content. Below is an illustrative example of how you might approach this by using the \`columnAdded\` event of the \`SmartTable\` or manipulating the inner \`Table\` control after it's fully initialized. # Using Custom Data on Columns in XML View and Post-Rendering Manipulation This example assumes you're working with an XML view and a \`SmartTable\`. First, add custom data to your column in the view to identify it for later manipulation: \`\`\`xml <smartTable:SmartTable xmlns:smartTable=\\"sap.ui.comp.smarttable\\" ...> <Table> <columns> <Column> <customData> <core:CustomData key=\\"isLink\\" value=\\"true\\" writeToDom=\\"true\\"/> </customData> <Label text=\\"My Column\\"/> </Column> ... </columns> </Table> </smartTable:SmartTable> \`\`\` Then, in your controller, you could manipulate the desired column header after the table is fully loaded. Depending on your setup, you might do this in the \`onAfterRendering\` hook of the controller or in response to a specific event signaling the table is fully loaded: \`\`\`javascript onAfterRendering: function() { var oTable = this.getView().byId(\\"yourSmartTableId\\").getTable(); oTable.getColumns().forEach(function(oColumn) { // Access custom data from column var isLink = oColumn.getCustomData().some(function(oCustomData) { return oCustomData.getKey() === \\"isLink\\" && oCustomData.getValue() === \\"true\\"; }); if (isLink) { // Replace header with a Link control var oLink = new sap.m.Link({ text: oColumn.getLabel().getText(), press: function(oEvent) { // Link press action } }); oColumn.setAggregation(\\"header\\", oLink); } }); } \`\`\` # Considerations 1. **Execution Timing**: Ensure that the logic runs at the right moment when all columns are rendered and accessible. 2. **Event Listening**: For some use cases, listening to events like \`columnAdded\` might be more appropriate than using lifecycle methods like \`onAfterRendering\`. 3. **Performance**: Manipulating columns after rendering might impact performance, especially for tables with a large number of rows or columns. Always test for performance implications. 4. **Maintenance**: Custom modifications might increase the maintenance work required, especially if the Smart Table or SAPUI5 library updates change relevant internal behaviors. This approach is somewhat manual and requires understanding of the underlying \`sap.ui.table.Column\` or \`sap.m.Column\` (depending on the table type used within the \`SmartTable\`) and the lifecycle of SAPUI5 controls. Always consider future maintenance and the impact of library updates when using such approaches."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is required by your project at runtime, specifically because your project uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) which you've compiled and linked against. There are several ways to resolve this issue, depending on your system's setup and how you want to manage dependencies. Here are some strategies you can try: # 1. Install Protobuf System-Wide If you haven't already, ensure that Protobuf version 17 is installed on your system. How you do this may vary depending on your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu-based systems, you can try installing it through \`apt-get\` (though you might not get the exact version you need from the default repositories): \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libprotobuf17 \`\`\` However, if \`libprotobuf17\` isn't available through your package manager, or if you need a specific version that isn't provided, you might need to build it from source. # 2. Adjust \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` If you've installed or built Protobuf in a non-standard location, the dynamic linker might not be able to find it. You can point it to the correct path by setting the \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` environment variable: \`\`\`bash export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/protobuf/libs:LD_LIBRARY_PATH \`\`\` Replace \`/path/to/protobuf/libs\` with the actual directory containing \`libprotobuf.so.17\`. This is a runtime solution; you have to set this environment variable in the context where you're running your program (or add it to your \`.bashrc\` or similar shell initialization script for a more persistent solution). # 3. Use \`rpath\` or \`chrpath\` on Your Targets When building your targets, you can specify the rpath (runtime library search path) to embed paths to your libraries directly into the binaries. Adjust your \`CMakeLists.txt\` to include the following for your targets when linking: \`\`\`cmake set_target_properties({PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTIES ... BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH TRUE INSTALL_RPATH \\"/path/to/protobuf/libs\\" ... ) \`\`\` Alternatively, use the \`chrpath\` tool (if available for your system) on an already compiled binary to modify its rpath without recompilation: \`\`\`bash chrpath -r /path/to/protobuf/libs your_binary \`\`\` # 4. Installing or Specifying Protobuf in Non-Standard Ways If none of the above solutions work or are desirable, and you've manually built Protobuf, ensure that you've correctly installed it (using \`make install\` if you followed the build-from-source approach), and verify that its PKGCONFIG path or CMake files are in paths that your build environment recognizes. # Summary Ensure that the Protobuf library (\`libprotobuf.so.17\`) is installed on your system and available either in standard locations or specified through environment variables or build system configurations. If you continue to experience issues, verify the version number and paths, as a mismatch or typo could also cause this error."},{"instruction":"متن زیر را به فارسی تبدیل کن Their goal: make us love (or hate) the characters. There aren’t a lot of terribly subtle shadings of character in Dickens or Thackeray. We cheer and hiss with enthusiasm. Readers responded to these characters as if they were family members (or threats to them). Character is absolutely central to the ongoing serial. Think of J.R. and Bobby Ewing. Why has Susan Lucci been able to keep the same role for three hundred years? Because viewers respond viscerally to her character. In Victorian times, readers wrote to novelists with their thoughts on the current book, and writers listened. Thackeray was told that readers wanted “less of Amelia,” the sugary-sweet, somewhat boring girl in Vanity Fair, that they wanted to see Laura marry Warrington in Pendennis (which title has always struck me as more than vaguely obscene, but no matter). Novels were changed based on fan reaction, sometimes even to projected reaction, as in Bulwer￾Lytton’s famous advice to Dickens not to attempt the more logical, unhappy ending of Great Expectations. Again, I give you Dallas: why did they miraculously revive the dead Bobby Ewing? Fan unrest. In all these cases, the central reality is that readers wish to be involved in their novels. Wish? Nay, need. The earnestness with which nineteenth-century readers engaged with characters and their stories is touching in its naïveté. At the same time we know that, in our own day, characters on series television sometimes receive fan or hate mail (more often the latter) and stars of soap operas are often greeted with either the love or venom their characters, and not they, merit. Whence comes that need for involvement? I believe it grows out of the desire to be swept away to somewhere else, and that’s what novels do, even when the place they sweep us to looks a great deal like our own. A reader in Dorset or Wiltshire might recognize the landscapes and notable buildings of Hardy’s Wessex, might see exterior Dorchester in his Casterbridge, but the place in which Tess or Jude live and struggle bears scant resemblance to any place current or historical. Joyce’s Dublin has real place-names in it, and one can map out every story and novel (and indeed, someone has, in many cases more than once). And those of us who have been to academic conferences learn, to either our consternation or, more likely, relief, that they are neither as hilarious nor as disastrous as those in the novels of David Lodge or Malcolm Bradbury. They are just close enough to the originals to give a frisson of recognition, just far enough away to be entertaining. The American poet Marianne Moore characterized her poetry as the making of “imaginary gardens with real toads in them.” In the case of novels, the real—or potentially real—toads are characters, persons we can react to, relate to, accept or reject, identify with, suffer over. Sometimes those persons and their environments are quite familiar, as in the case of Iris Murdoch’s fiction. She was successful most of her twenty-seven times out of the gate with a fairly simple formula: take perfectly ordinary members of the privileged class—academics (like the author and her husband, John Bayley), television executives, publishers, stage people—place them in ordinary circumstances—summer home, retirement villa, suburban terrace house —and introduce one odd event—a surprise appearance of former friend or complete stranger, an accidental death, a crime witnessed—and watch what happens. And we did. Readers flocked to her work from Under the Net (1954) to Jackson’s Dilemma (1995), putting up with sometimes windy philosophical observations from the truly observant and the harebrained alike, just to see what happened next. It was a familiar world, as many of her readers did indeed belong to the class she portrayed, did in fact live in Murdochland, as it was often called, or its overseas equivalents. Why? Because she made us believe in her characters and want to see what they might get up to. Do we have to love them? Want to be them? No. That’s part of the beauty of the novel, that it follows the Law of Us and Them: Readers choose the degree to which they identify with characters. We can try on experiences and identities for a few hours that we would never want as our permanent condition, or we can stand aloof from the proceedings and take only a clinical interest. We don’t have to be Heathcliff or Aureliano Buendía or Tess, but we can be if we want. Every teacher knows this, having had students in the same class divide between those who identify fully with Atticus Finch or Jane Eyre and those who wouldn’t touch them with a barge pole. The novel goes on either way, and so does the reading.","output":"هدفشان این است که ما شخصیت‌ها را دوست داشته باشیم (یا از آنها متنفر شویم). رگه‌های بسیار ظریف شخصیتی در دیکنز یا تاکری وجود ندارد. ما با اشتیاق تشویق می‌کنیم و هو می‌کنیم. خوانندگان به این شخصیت‌ها واکنش نشان دادند گویی که اعضای خانواده خودشان (یا تهدیدی برای آن‌ها) هستند. شخصیت کاملاً در مرکز سریال‌های در حال ادامه قرار دارد. به جی.آر و بابی ایوینگ فکر کنید. چرا سوزان لوچی توانسته همان نقش را برای سیصد سال ایفا کند؟ زیرا بینندگان به شخصیت او واکنش عمیقی نشان می‌دهند. در دوران ویکتوریا، خوانندگان با نگارش نظراتشان درباره کتاب جاری با نویسندگان ارتباط برقرار می‌کردند و نویسندگان گوش می‌دادند. به تاکری گفته شده بود که خوانندگان می‌خواهند \\"کمتر از املیا\\"، دختر شیرین و کمی خسته کننده در نمایش باطل، ببینند، که می‌خواستند لائورا با وارینگتون در پندنیس ازدواج کند (که این عنوان همیشه برایم بیش از حد نامناسب به نظر می‌رسید، اما مهم نیست). رمان‌ها بر اساس واکنش هواداران، گاهی حتی به واکنش پیش‌بینی‌شده، مانند مشاوره معروف بولور-لیتون به دیکنز برای اجتناب از انجام پایان منطقی‌تر و ناخوشایند داستان بزرگ انتظارات تغییر کرد. دوباره، به شما دالاس را می‌گویم: چرا بابی ایوینگ به طور معجزه‌آسایی احیا شد؟ به خاطر نارضایتی طرفداران. در تمام این موارد، واقعیت اصلی این است که خوانندگان مایلند در رمان‌هایشان دخیل باشند. آرزو دارند؟ نه، نیاز دارند. جدیتی که خوانندگان قرن نوزدهم با شخصیت‌ها و داستان‌هایشان درگیر شده‌اند، به خاطر سادگی‌اش لمس شده است. در عین حال ما می‌دانیم که، در روزگار خودمان، شخصیت‌های تلویزیونی گاهی اوقات نامه‌های طرفداران یا نامه‌های نفرت (غالباً آخری) دریافت می‌کنند و ستارگان سریال‌های روزانه اغلب با عشق یا کینه‌ای که شایسته شخصیت‌هایشان، نه خود آنها، است، مورد استقبال قرار می‌گیرند. این نیاز برای دخیل شدن از کجا ناشی می‌شود؟ باور دارم از آرزوی فرار به جای دیگری نشأت می‌گیرد، و این همان کاری است که رمان‌ها انجام می‌دهند، حتی وقتی جایی که ما را به آن می‌برند بسیار شبیه به خودمان است. یک خواننده در دورست یا ویلت‌شایر ممکن است مناظر و بناهای قابل توجه وسکس هاردی را بشناسد، ممکن است دورچستر بیرونی را در کستربریج او ببیند، اما جایی که تس یا جود زندگی و کشمکش می‌کنند شباهت اندکی به هر مکان فعلی یا تاریخی دارد. دوبلین جویس نام‌های مکان واقعی در آن دارد و می‌توان هر داستان و رمان را (و در واقع، گاهی اوقات بیش از یک بار) نقشه‌برداری کرد. و آنهایی که به کنفرانس‌های علمی رفته‌ایم، یاد می‌گیریم که آنها نه آنقدر خنده‌دارند و نه آنقدر فاجعه‌بار هستند که در رمان‌های دیوید لاج یا مالکم بردبری. آنها تنها به اندازه کافی به اصل نزدیک هستند که یک احساس شناخت ایجاد کنند، تنها به اندازه‌ای دور هستند که سرگرم‌کننده باشند. شاعر آمریکایی، ماریان مور، شعرش را به عنوان ساختن \\"باغ‌های خیالی با قورباغه‌های واقعی در آن‌ها\\" توصیف کرد. در مورد رمان‌ها، قورباغه‌های واقعی یا بالقوه واقعی، شخصیت‌ها هستند، افرادی که ما می‌توانیم به آنها واکنش نشان دهیم، به آنها ارتباط پیدا کنیم، آنها را بپذیریم یا رد کنیم، با آنها همذات‌پنداری کنیم، بر سر آنها رنج بکشیم. گاهی اوقات این افراد و محیط‌هایشان بسیار آشنا هستند، همانطور که در داستان‌های ایریس مرداک اتفاق می‌افتد. او در بیست و هفت بار تلاش خود با یک فرمول نسبتا ساده بسیار موفق بود: اعضای کاملا عادی طبقه ممتاز—اعضای هیئت علمی (مانند خود نویسنده و همسرش، جان بیلی)، مدیران تلویزیونی، ناشران، افراد مرتبط با صحنه— را در شرایط عادی قرار دهید—خانه تابستانی، ویلا بازنشستگی، خانه تراس شهری— و یک رویداد عجیب را معرفی کنید—ظاهر شدن غافلگیرکننده یک دوست قدیمی یا یک غریبه کامل، یک مرگ تصادفی، یک جرم شاهد— و ببینید چه اتفاقی می‌افتد. و ما دیدیم. خوانندگان از اولین اثر او \\"زیر تور\\" (1954) تا \\"معمای جکسون\\" (1995) به کار او روی آوردند، گاهی اوقات مشاهدات فلسفی گاهی اوقات پرطمطراق را از همه کسانی که واقعاً مشاهده‌گر و کم‌فهم هستند، تحمل کرده‌اند، فقط برای دیدن اتفاق بعدی. این یک جهان آشنا بود، زیرا بسیاری از خوانندگانش واقعاً متعلق به طبقه‌ای بودند که او تصویر کرده بود، در واقع در مرداکلند، همانطور که اغلب نامیده می‌شد، یا معادل‌های خارجی آن زندگی می‌کردند. چرا؟ زیرا او ما را باورمند به شخصیت‌هایش کرد و خواستار دیدن این شد که آنها چه کارهایی انجام می‌دهند. آیا ما باید آنها را دوست داشته باشیم؟ خواستار این هستیم که آنها باشیم؟ نه. این بخشی از زیبایی رمان است، که آن قانون ما و آنها را دنبال می‌کند: خوانندگان درجه همذات‌پنداری‌شان با شخصیت‌ها را انتخاب می‌کنند. ما می‌توانیم برای چند ساعت تجربیات و هویت‌ها را امتحان کنیم که هرگز نمی‌خواهیم وضعیت دائمی ما باشند، یا می‌توانیم از رویدادها فاصله بگیریم و تنها علاقه بالینی داشته باشیم. ما نیازی نداریم هیثکلیف یا اورلیانو بوئندیا یا تس باشیم، اما اگر بخواهیم، می‌توانیم باشیم. هر معلمی این را می‌داند، زیرا دانش‌آموزانی را در همان کلاس داشته که بین کسانی که کاملاً با آتیکوس فینچ یا جین ایر همذات پنداری می‌کنند و کسانی که حتی با یک چوب قایق به آنها دست نمی‌زنند، تقسیم شده‌اند. رمان به هر حال ادامه دارد، و خواندن هم چنین."},{"instruction":"Error reloading plugin: libprotobuf.so.17: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18) #

This ongoing war is rooted in a complex mix of historical ties, ethnic and linguistic divisions, geopolitical ambitions, and political conflicts. Several key factors contribute to the persistence of this conflict: 1. **Territorial Claims and Political Ambitions**: Russia has laid claims to Ukrainian territory, most notably Crimea and parts of Eastern Ukraine, where separatist movements aligned with Russian interests have been active since 2014. Russia's broader goal appears to be to prevent Ukraine from moving closer to Western organizations like NATO and the European Union, thereby keeping Ukraine within its sphere of influence. 2. **Ukrainian Sovereignty and National Identity**: Ukraine has demonstrated a strong commitment to defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since the Maidan Revolution in 2014, which ousted a pro-Russian president, Ukraine has increasingly leaned towards the West, seeking closer ties with the EU and NATO, further incensing Russia. 3. **International Responses and Allegiances**: The conflict has drawn in various international actors, most notably Western countries, including the United States, which have provided Ukraine with military aid, economic support, and political backing. These efforts aim to bolster Ukraine’s defense capability, counter Russian military aggression, and signal Western opposition to Russia's territorial ambitions. Why America is Involved: The United States' involvement can be attributed to a combination of factors: - **Support for International Rules and Norms**: The U.S. views Russia’s actions, especially the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine, as a violation of international law and a threat to the rules-based international order. Supporting Ukraine is seen as upholding these principles. - **NATO and European Security**: As a leading NATO member, the U.S. is committed to the security of Europe. Russia's actions near NATO's borders are perceived as a threat to collective security, prompting the U.S. to support Ukraine as a means of deterring further Russian aggression in the region. - **Strategic Rivalry**: The conflict is set against the backdrop of long-standing tensions between Russia and the United States, with both countries viewing the other as a strategic rival. Supporting Ukraine is part of a broader strategy by the U.S. to counter Russian influence and activities that are considered destabilizing. Why the Conflict Persists: - **Stalemate and Escalation**: Military engagements have reached somewhat of a stalemate, with neither side able to secure a decisive victory. This has been compounded by the fact that both sides have external support, allowing them to continue fighting. - **Differing Aims and Unmet Objectives**: The differing objectives of Russia and Ukraine, and by extension their supporters, mean that finding a mutually acceptable resolution is challenging. Russia’s ambitious territorial and political aims conflict directly with Ukraine’s desire for sovereignty and Western integration. - **Absence of Effective Negotiation Channels**: While there have been attempts at negotiating peace, including the Minsk agreements, these have largely failed to achieve lasting peace. The prerequisites for negotiation — such as a ceasefire, withdrawal of foreign troops, and restoration of Ukrainian control over its borders — have not been met. Given the complex interplay of national ambitions, international politics, and strategic interests, finding a resolution to the conflict is challenging.

Mas havia um problema: a lua de Mirandor havia desaparecido, e sem o seu brilho, Filipe não conseguia encontrar as cores certas para suas auroras. Triste e determinado, Filipe decidiu que encontraria a lua perdida. Antes de partir, a sábia coruja Odetta deu-lhe um conselho: “A lua é guiada pelos sonhos e esperanças. Para encontrá-la, você deve seguir seus próprios sonhos.” Assim, Filipe embarcou na maior aventura de sua vida. Ele cruzou vales profundos, subiu as montanhas mais altas e atravessou florestas encantadas. Durante sua jornada, encontrou diversos animais que compartilhavam com ele seus sonhos, esperanças e até mesmo seus medos. Filipe os ouviu atentamente e ajudou-os da maneira que podia, deixando um rastro de cores e felicidade por onde passava. Certo dia, ao alcançar o topo da montanha mais alta de Mirandor, Filipe encontrou um lago cristalino. Olhando-se no reflexo da água, ele se viu cercado por todas as cores que havia espalhado pelo reino. Foi então que percebeu: a lua estava dentro dele. Suas ações carinhosas, sua coragem de perseguir um sonho, e sua capacidade de espalhar esperança haviam trazido a luz necessária de volta ao reino. Com essa revelação, Filipe respirou fundo e soprou as mais belas auroras que Mirandor já tinha visto. O céu se iluminou em cores deslumbrantes, e, para a surpresa de todos, a lua reapareceu, brilhando mais forte do que nunca, guiada de volta pelo coração valente do pequeno dragão. Filipe voltou para casa como um herói, não por ter-lhe devolvido a lua, mas por ensinar a todos em Mirandor que o mais importante é seguir os próprios sonhos e iluminar o caminho para os outros. E assim, com a lua novamente no céu, Filipe continuou a criar suas auroras todas as noites, lembrando a todos do poder dos sonhos e da esperança. --- A história \\"O Pequeno Dragão e a Lua Perdida\\" sugere que, mesmo os menores entre nós podem ter um grande impacto quando seguem seus corações e sonhos.

This includes source code specific to the mod, HL2 SDK libraries, and generated protobuf files. - Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) files are explicitly handled, with custom commands set up to generate source and header files from \`.proto\` file definitions. - The script ensures that Protobuf libraries are found and linked correctly, indicating the use of Protobuf for structured data serialization, likely for network communication or configuration. # Build Configurations for Linux and Windows - It checks for the target platform (Linux or Windows) and adjusts the build process accordingly. For instance, it includes a specific source file (\`memoverride.cpp\`) only for Linux. - Directories for placing the built library are customized based on the platform. - Platform-specific makefiles (\`linux.base.cmake\` and \`windows.base.cmake\`) are included to presumably set platform-specific build flags and configurations. # Linking and Custom Build Commands - \`target_link_libraries\` is used to link the project with required libraries, including dynamically linking with Protobuf libraries. - A pre-build custom command is defined to copy configuration files from the source directory to the binary directory. # Comments on Best Practices and Potential Improvements 1. **Modular Structure**: Breaking down the CMake configuration into smaller, platform-specific files (\`linux.base.cmake\`, \`windows.base.cmake\`) is a good practice for readability and maintainability. 2. **Use of Global Variables**: The script sets properties like \`Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS\` and \`Protobuf_DEBUG\` globally. While this can work, using target-specific properties might be more flexible in a larger, more complex project. 3. **Custom Commands for Code Generation**: The custom commands for Protobuf files are a critical part of the build process, ensuring that source files are generated from \`.proto\` definitions before the main compilation begins. This is a common and recommended practice for projects that use Protobuf. 4. **Potential for Improvement**: The script can potentially be made more efficient and readable by grouping related functionalities (e.g., Protobuf handling) into functions or macros, thus improving modularity. This script exemplifies a complex build process tailored for a cross-platform C++ project involving external libraries, platform-specific configurations, and code generation."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a floor of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman sitting, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"Serene Elegance | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Exquisite Beauty with Bouquet | Fashionable Sheer Blouse & Balayage Hair"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Serene Elegance | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Exquisite Beauty with Bouquet | Fashionable Sheer Blouse &amp; Balayage Hair.

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","output":"Your concept for an alternate universe Dick Grayson, reimagined as Nightshade under the mentorship of Slade Wilson instead of Bruce Wayne, is fascinating and ripe with potential for complex storytelling. This inversion not only provides a fresh take on Grayson's character but also delves deep into the thematic underpinnings of nature versus nurture, the impact of mentorship, and the quest for identity amidst adversity. Here are some thoughts on refining and enhancing this concept: # Deepening Character Complexity: - **Moral Ambiguity:** The key to making Nightshade resonate as an anti-hero will be in how you portray his moral struggles and justifications. His methods and decision-making should reflect a tortured soul trying to do good through questionable means, highlighting the dichotomy within him due to his upbringing under Slade. - **Path to Redemption:** Nightshade's journey should also focus on redemption, not just from his actions but also from the influence Slade has over him. This internal conflict can be a central theme, exploring how he seeks to prove he's more than just Slade's creation. # Expanding Relationships: - **Foster Siblings Dynamic:** Deepening the dynamics between Nightshade and his foster siblings (Rose, Grant, and Joey) could further explore themes of family, loyalty, and betrayal. Their complex relationships can reflect the broader conflict between Nightshade's learned behavior from Slade and his innate desires to forge his own path. - **Enemy to Ally Transformations:** Nightshade's interactions with canonical heroes and villains can be more nuanced. For instance, his relationship with Batman could be adversarial at first but evolve into a begrudging mutual respect as they occasionally collaborate against common foes, reflecting Nightshade's gradual alignment with more heroic ideals. # Utilizing Grayson’s Skills and Traits: - **Acrobatics and Technology Synergy:** Highlighting how Nightshade uses technology not just to compensate for his lost enhancements but as an extension of his acrobatic prowess could set him apart. His ability to merge physicality with technology in creative ways can be his signature, mirroring how he's merging his past with his ambitions for the future. - **Psychological Warfare:** Your concept taps into Nightshade employing psychological tactics; this can be expanded into a significant trait. His understanding of the human psyche, learned from manipulating perceptions and his acting skills, can be a tool for unraveling enemies and navigating the hero-villain spectrum. # Plot Development and World-Building: - **Slade's Long Game:** Slade’s motivations for training Nightshade could be part of a larger, more mysterious endgame. This overarching plot can serve as a backdrop that influences Nightshade’s actions and decisions, presenting him with dilemmas that test his morality, loyalty, and end goals. - **Court of Owls:** Utilizing the Court of Owls not just as a part of Nightshade's origin but as a recurring element in his story could add depth. Perhaps they have their own interest in Nightshade, viewing him as a potential Talon or a pawn in their schemes against Slade, which could lead to intriguing narrative arcs exploring his heritage and destiny. # Conclusion: Overall, your concept for an alternate universe Dick Grayson as Nightshade under the mentorship of Slade Wilson is compelling and rich with potential. By focusing on deepening character complexity, expanding relationships, utilizing Grayson’s skills and traits innovatively, and exploring plot development and world-building, Nightshade could become a standout character that both honors and diverges from the legacy of Dick Grayson in fascinating ways."},{"instruction":"How’s this for an addition?

Remember…Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade…not Batman… Remember…these are physiological enhancements…he CANNOT turn off them obviously…","output":"The addition of Dick Grayson's earlier vigilante identity as the 'Gray Sparrow' before evolving into 'Nightshade' presents a compelling narrative arc, further enriching his backstory and character development. This transformation offers a deeper exploration of Grayson's journey from an optimistic but naïve hero into a seasoned, tech-savvy anti-hero, marking his relentless pursuit of self-definition and independence from Slade Wilson's shadow. Here's a breakdown of how this addition enriches the character and story: # The Symbolic Evolution: - **From Gray Sparrow to Nightshade:** The transition from 'Gray Sparrow' to 'Nightshade' symbolizes Grayson's growth from hopeful idealism to pragmatic realism. The 'Gray Sparrow' persona signifies his initial attempt to carve out a separate identity from Slade, clinging to a part of his past and embodying a lighter, if not fully formed, approach to vigilantism. The eventual evolution into 'Nightshade' reflects a mature, grittier perspective, shaped by harsh experiences and betrayals, symbolizing his complete break from Slade and the birth of a new, independent identity. # The Physical and Psychological Toll: - **Forced Enhancements and Their Aftermath:** Slade's decision to forcibly enhance Grayson, only for Grayson to nearly sacrifice himself to remove those enhancements, adds layers of physical and psychological trauma to his character. It's a stark portrayal of the lengths he's willing to go to reclaim his body and mind from Slade's control, highlighting his resilience and determination. The subsequent health struggles and his fight to overcome them not only humanize him but also underscore the theme of rebirth and self-made evolution. # Technology as Liberation and Identity: - **Tech-Savvy Nightshade:** Grayson's turn towards technology as a means of recovery and empowerment is a fascinating narrative choice. It signifies his adaptability and intelligence, showcasing how he leverages his skills to compensate for the loss of his full enhancements and to create a unique niche for himself separate from Slade. This technological prowess becomes a key part of his identity as 'Nightshade,' blending with his acrobatic skills to form a distinct fighting style that keeps him unpredictable. # The Costume as a Metaphor: - **Visual Identity Transformation:** The transition from the simple and durable costume of the 'Gray Sparrow' to the sleek, aerodynamic suit of 'Nightshade' not only serves as a physical marker of his evolution but also as a metaphor for shedding his past and embracing a new path. The choice to keep the 'Gray Sparrow' costume as a reminder of his journey adds a layer of sentimentality and reflection, emphasizing his complex relationship with his past. # Tackling the Enhancements and Health Issues: - **Realistic Consequences and Recovery:** The storyline surrounding Grayson's forced enhancements, the radical attempt at removal, and the subsequent health issues introduces realistic consequences to superhuman alterations, a topic often glossed over. It grounds the story in realism, showcasing the vulnerabilities and limits of even the most formidable heroes. His recovery and adaptation, culminating in his release from lingering health issues, symbolize his resilience and refusal to be defined or limited by his physical condition. In summary, the addition of the 'Gray Sparrow' phase to Nightshade's backstory enriches the character's narrative arc, offering a nuanced exploration of identity, resilience, and transformation. It serves as a powerful testament to the character's journey from being moulded by forces beyond his control to taking charge of his destiny, marking his transition from a hopeful young hero to a pragmatic, determined anti-hero. This backstory lays a solid foundation for exploring the complexities of Dick Grayson’s character in an alternate universe, making it a compelling addition to his story."},{"instruction":"I’m trying to play with the whole partially physiologically enhanced still… Like he’s not as physiologically enhanced as before…but still is…physiological-wise…how to describe that?...he's still enhanced...just not as good..so he compensates with extra training, technology as tools, and so on..","output":"Integrating the concept that Dick Grayson, now Nightshade, is still physiologically enhanced but not to the extent he once was after attempting to remove Slade’s forced enhancements can be described and explored through a few narrative lenses. This nuanced approach allows for an exploration of how he adapts and compensates for these changes, making for a rich character development arc. Here's how you might describe and weave this into the storyline: # Describing Nightshade’s Current Enhancement Status: Nightshade retains remnants of the physiological enhancements that once made him akin to a living weapon under Slade's harsh tutelage. Though he underwent a grueling procedure to rid himself of the majority of these artificial enhancements, their vestiges still linger within him, offering him a level of physical prowess beyond that of an ordinary human but markedly less than his peak as the 'Gray Sparrow'. This reduced state forces him into a precarious balance, leveraging what remains of his superhuman capabilities while confronting the limitations and vulnerabilities that come with them. # Compensation through Training and Technology: **Training:** While his body retains shades of its former capabilities, Nightshade pushes himself through rigorous training regimens, perhaps even employing esoteric and ancient techniques learned from various encounters across the globe. This training isn't just about maintaining physical condition; it's a relentless pursuit to refine technique, increase efficiency, and turn even the smallest advantage into a significant edge in combat. **Technology as a Force Multiplier:** Recognizing the imperatives of his new reality, Nightshade delves deep into technology, turning to it not as a mere supplement but as an extension of his will. His gadgets, suit, and weapons are meticulously designed or adapted to synergize with his unique physiology, enhancing his natural abilities and compensating for what he has lost. Each piece of tech he carries is a testament to his resilience, an answer to the challenge of not just surviving but thriving in a world that demands more than what his body alone can now give. # Psychological Aspect: The journey through forced enhancement, the painful bid for removal, and living with the aftermath becomes a crucible that tempers Nightshade's mental fortitude. He is acutely aware that he walks a razor's edge, a reality that sharpens his strategic thinking, tactical planning, and situational awareness. This psychological edge, born from necessity, becomes one of his most potent weapons, allowing him to outmaneuver foes who might underestimate him due to his reduced enhancements. # Balancing Human Vulnerability with Enhanced Abilities: Nightshade exists in a unique liminal space, straddling the line between enhanced being and mortal man. This duality is the core of his character, offering narrative avenues to explore themes of identity, human limitation, and the essence of heroism. His struggles and victories underscore a fundamental message: that true strength often lies not in the power one possesses but in how one chooses to wield it. # Narrative Exploration: This condition of being \\"still enhanced, just not as good\\" allows for a wealth of storytelling possibilities, from exploring his day-to-day adaptations, the redesign of his gear and fighting style, to the deeper, more existential wrestlings with his identity and purpose. Nightshade's story becomes one of adaptation, innovation, and resilience, highlighting that while the flesh may falter, the spirit can soar. In summary, Nightshade’s partially retained enhancements and his journey to compensate for them through additional training and technology offer a compelling narrative of resilience and adaptability. They also present a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of human and superhuman, illustrating how limitations can spur creativity, determination, and a deeper understanding of one's capabilities and identity."},{"instruction":"Give me some ideas to explain on how he is still partially physiologically enhanced please......","output":"Exploring how Nightshade (Dick Grayson) is still partially physiologically enhanced involves delving into specific attributes that differentiate him from a normal human being, despite not being as powerful as he once was. This nuanced approach provides a rich vein of storytelling potential, focusing on how these enhancements affect his capabilities, identity, and interactions with the world around him. Here are some ideas to elaborate on Nightshade's partially enhanced condition: # 1. **Baseline Physical Abilities**: Even though Nightshade's enhancements have been scaled back, he maintains a baseline level of physical ability that surpasses peak human condition. This could include superior strength, agility, and reflexes that allow him to perform feats like leaping extraordinary distances, reacting with near precognitive speed, or lifting objects several times heavier than what a top-tier athlete could manage. These abilities, while diminished from their peak, still make him a formidable opponent. # 2. **Regenerative Healing**: Nightshade could possess a faster-than-normal recovery rate, allowing him to heal from injuries quicker than an ordinary human. This regenerative ability wouldn't be instantaneous or as robust as before his attempted reversal of the enhancements, but it significantly reduces downtime from injuries that would otherwise sideline normal vigilantes for weeks. # 3. **Sensory Amplification**: His sensory perceptions could be heightened in a way that gives him an edge in combat and surveillance. Enhanced vision (including low-light conditions), hearing, and even tactile senses could play into Nightshade's skills as a detective and combatant, allowing him to notice details and movements that others would miss. # 4. **Neural Efficiency**: Part of Nightshade's enhancements could include neural alterations that increase his processing speed, memory recall, and resistance to mental fatigue. This would make him capable of complex calculations, strategy formulation, and learning new skills at a pace far beyond normal, though not to the extent of being superhuman. It would also provide a resistance or immunity to psychological warfare tactics that would otherwise be effective on him. # 5. **Metabolic Efficiency**: Nightshade's body could be more efficient in terms of metabolism, requiring less sustenance to maintain peak condition while also being able to endure harsh conditions better than a normal human. This would allow him to operate for extended periods without rest or sustenance, giving him a stamina edge in prolonged engagements. # 6. **Enhanced Durability**: Though not invulnerable, Nightshade's body could be more resistant to physical trauma than that of an ordinary person. His muscles, bones, and tissues could be denser, allowing him to withstand impacts, falls, and blows that would incapacitate or seriously injure others. This durability would be a vestige of his previous full enhancements, making him tough but not unbreakable. # 7. **Adrenal Adaptation**: Under high stress or in situations of extreme danger, Nightshade could have the ability to temporarily boost his physical capabilities through an adrenal surge. Unlike his previous fully enhanced state, these boosts would be short-lived and come with a physical cost, requiring careful management to avoid exhaustion or damage. # Incorporating the Enhancements into the Story: Explaining Nightshade's partially enhanced capabilities offers an opportunity to explore not just the physical but the psychological and emotional ramifications of living with such changes. It adds layers to his character as he navigates the world, balancing between human limitations and the remnants of his superhuman past. These enhancements can also drive plotlines, as Nightshade may encounter situations where he has to rely on his wit and remaining enhancements to overcome challenges that his former, fully enhanced self might have brute-forced through. In essence, Nightshade’s partially enhanced condition is a testament to his resilience and adaptability, serving as a constant reminder of his past with Slade and his ongoing journey to define himself beyond those experiences."},{"instruction":"Would this also plausibly explain why and how he can do solo operations and such?....actually....what if he gets affected by fear-toxin or Joker-Toxin then?....","output":"Absolutely, Nightshade's partially enhanced physiology—though not as potent as before—would feasibly underpin his capacity to conduct solo operations effectively. His blend of superior physical abilities, heightened senses, and enhanced neural efficiency positions him as a highly capable solo operative, even in the intricate and perilous landscape of vigilante justice. It allows him to rely less on backup and more on his skills, planning, and the element of surprise. Moreover, his adeptness with technology and improvisation adds another layer to his solo capabilities, making him a versatile and unpredictable player in the field. # Impact of Fear-Toxin or Joker-Toxin: Encounters with fear-toxin or Joker-Toxin present unique challenges for any vigilante, including Nightshade. These substances are designed to exploit vulnerabilities, specifically mental and emotional ones, which could bypass some of the physical and sensory enhancements Nightshade benefits from. Here's how each scenario could plausibly unfold for him: **Fear-Toxin Exposure:** Given Nightshade's enhanced neural efficiency and regenerative healing, his response to fear-toxin might be atypical. While initially, the toxin would induce the expected hallucinogenic and fear-amplifying effects, his brain could potentially process and clear the toxin faster than a normal person's, shortening the toxin's effective duration. This doesn't negate the immediate psychological threat but suggests a resilience that could see him recovering quicker, though he'd still need to combat the toxin's effects with sheer willpower and mental fortitude until his physiology catches up. **Joker-Toxin Encounter:** Joker-Toxin, notorious for its lethal grin-inducing end, poses a severe threat to any individual, enhanced or otherwise. Nightshade's metabolic efficiency and partial regenerative capabilities could offer him a slight edge, slowing the toxin's progress and giving him a critical window to seek an antidote or for his body to fight off the effects. However, this doesn't assure immunity but rather buys time against an otherwise fast-acting toxin. The physiological struggle against Joker-Toxin could also have profound psychological impacts, emphasizing the constant danger Nightshade faces and his vulnerability to chemical and biological warfare. # Narrative and Character Development Opportunities: These scenarios offer rich veins for character and story development: - **Vulnerability and Reliance on Allies:** Despite his capabilities, facing such toxins could force Nightshade into situations where he must rely on allies, highlighting his limitations and challenging his often solitary approach. It can serve to deepen bonds with allies, showing that even the most capable heroes can't always go it alone. - **Psychological Exploration:** The aftermath of such encounters provides an opportunity to explore Nightshade's psyche, including any latent fears, unresolved issues from his past, especially concerning his time with Slade, and his resolve to continue his vigilante path despite the risks. - **Preparation and Adaptation:** Experiencing the effects of these toxins can lead Nightshade to develop specific countermeasures or antitoxins, further showcasing his ingenuity and determination to overcome vulnerabilities. This preparatory aspect can add depth to his character, showcasing his strategic mindset and adaptability. In sum, Nightshade's partially enhanced status not only informs his capability to operate solo but also introduces layers of complexity when faced with challenges that exploit his mental and emotional vulnerabilities, like fear or Joker-Toxin. These scenarios not only present immediate physical dangers but also offer avenues for deeper character exploration and growth."},{"instruction":"I think it would make some interesting storylines?....heroes shocked and or surprised Nightshade is physiologically enhanced?..even a little?..but some heroes already knew....just not the full story......like maybe..Batman...who knows 'enough'..","output":"Indeed, the revelation of Nightshade's (Dick Grayson's) physiological enhancements, even in their diminished capacity, opens up a multitude of intriguing storyline possibilities. This aspect of his character can significantly impact his interactions with other heroes, his standing within the broader superhero community, and his personal narrative arcs. # Heroes' Reactions and Dynamics: - **Surprise and Suspicion:** Initially, many heroes might be taken aback upon discovering Nightshade's enhancements, especially if they've fought alongside him assuming he was entirely human. This revelation could lead to a mixed bag of reactions—ranging from surprise and curiosity to suspicion and concern about the origins, extent, and implications of his enhancements. - **Batman's Knowledge:** Batman, known for his comprehensive files on allies and adversaries alike, having 'enough' knowledge about Nightshade's condition adds a fascinating layer to their relationship. It positions Batman as a guardian of secrets and a potential mentor or adversary, depending on the narrative direction. Batman's partial insight into Nightshade's past and condition could serve as a plot device for tension, alliance, or intricate plays of knowledge and secrecy between them. # Storyline Themes: 1. **Trust and Transparency:** Storylines could explore themes of trust and transparency within hero communities. Nightshade's undisclosed enhancements could cause friction or feelings of betrayal among allies, prompting discussions about what information needs to be shared amongst a team and what can remain personal, exploring the boundaries of trust. 2. **Identity and Self-Acceptance:** Nightshade's struggle with his enhancements and how they alter his self-perception and place in the world offers rich territory for character development. Story arcs could delve into Nightshade accepting his partially enhanced status, understanding it doesn't define his heroism or worth, and navigating how he wants the world to perceive him. 3. **Ethics of Enhancement:** The fact that Nightshade was forcibly enhanced by Slade and chose to diminish those enhancements, albeit not entirely successfully, could lead to broader discussions within the superhero community about the ethics of enhancements. This could include debates on bioethics, consent, and the line between human and superhuman. 4. **Exploration of Limitations:** Nightshade's enhancements make him formidable, but they also come with limitations and unique vulnerabilities, such as the adverse effects from fear or Joker-Toxin. These can lead to storylines where Nightshade must outwit opponents targeting his specific weaknesses or where he must learn to rely on allies, showcasing the strength in vulnerability and cooperation. # Integration with Broader Universe Narratives: Integrating Nightshade's story with the overarching narratives of the universe can provide contrast and complements to existing themes. For example, his relationship with Batman and the Bat-family, given their history with Dick Grayson, offers a compelling narrative of parallel paths and divergent methods. Meanwhile, his interactions with other heroes, who are now reevaluating him post-reveal, can dissect the concept of what it means to be a hero beyond the physical capabilities—focusing on moral courage, determination, and empathy. In conclusion, Nightshade's enhancements and the partial knowledge of such by characters like Batman serve as a catalyst for unfolding drama, ethical debates, personal growth, and evolving hero dynamics. These storylines, rich with potential for conflict, intrigue, and collaboration, deepen the tapestry of the universe, making Nightshade a multifaceted character with significant impact both as an individual and within the ensemble of heroes."},{"instruction":"“No, no, no quiero saber todo lo que hice ayer Creo que perdí la cabeza Eso de beber tanto alcohol me hace perder dirección A veces uno ya no piensa No, no, no quiero saber todo lo que dije ayer Creo que se me soltó la lengua Eso de beber tanto alcohol cambia toda percepción Disminuye mi conciencia Voy dando vueltas en mi cama sin dormir Ay, estoy confundiendo la velada, me excedí” Make a translation for the text given.

The hardness of a material is determined by its resistance to deformation and scratching. Steel, depending on its specific composition and treatment, can be incredibly hard, often much harder than biological materials like bone. Human bones are made of a composite material that includes collagen (a protein that provides flexibility and strength in tension) and hydroxyapatite (a calcium phosphate mineral that provides hardness and strength in compression). This combination allows bones to be strong and somewhat flexible, but they are not as hard or as strong as many engineered materials, including many types of steel. However, the field of materials science, especially biomaterials, is rapidly advancing. Researchers are exploring ways to improve the mechanical properties of bones through various means, including pharmaceutical treatments, dietary supplements, and even nanotechnology. For instance, studies into bone diseases such as osteoporosis aim at increasing bone density and strength, which could theoretically lead to advancements in bone hardening techniques. Moreover, the concept of using nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes or graphene, to reinforce biological tissues suggests a future possibility where it could be feasible to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of bones. These materials possess extraordinary strength and stiffness and, if integrated with human bone, could potentially make the bones much stronger, although not necessarily harder than high-grade steel. Nevertheless, creating bones that are as hard or harder than steel would involve not only increasing the hardness but also ensuring that other critical properties, such as toughness and flexibility, are not detrimentally affected. Bones that are too hard could be more brittle, making them more susceptible to fracture under impact or stress. In summary, while human bones cannot currently be made harder than steel, ongoing research in materials science and biomedical engineering holds the promise of significantly enhancing the mechanical properties of bones in the future. However, any practical application of such technologies would also have to carefully consider the implications for health, mobility, and the body's overall function."},{"instruction":"When I ask this: (“No, no, no quiero saber todo lo que hice ayer Creo que perdí la cabeza Eso de beber tanto alcohol me hace perder dirección A veces uno ya no piensa No, no, no quiero saber todo lo que dije ayer Creo que se me soltó la lengua Eso de beber tanto alcohol cambia toda percepción Disminuye mi conciencia” could you translate it into french and that it sounds natural for native french speakers, also make it a comparisson between Spanish and French one line in french and the other below that in the original sentence, like that successively, and add an explanation with a breakdown for each line that it would be related to the verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,etc”) you answer like this (Certainly!

The words encapsulate a spectrum of devastation that expands through various levels of existence and cosmological structures. 1. **Humanity and People**: This initially targets the human species, suggesting an act that would lead to the extinction of human life. It implies a deliberate action to erase humans from existence. 2. **All Life**: Extends beyond humanity to include all forms of life, indicating a scenario where every living organism (plants, animals, microorganisms) on Earth would be completely erased. 3. **Earth**: Here, the concept evolves to include the non-living aspects of our planet as well – its oceans, landscapes, atmospheric composition – suggesting a total annihilation of the Earth itself, rendering it lifeless or possibly destroying it completely. 4. **Solar System**: Escalating further, this involves destruction beyond our planet to include the sun, planets, moons, and other celestial bodies within the gravitational influence of the Sun. It implies wiping out the entire solar system. 5. **Planets and Stars**: While it initially singles out planets, it rapidly encompasses stars as well, indicating a broader cosmic genocide that would involve extinguishing not only the planets around various stars but the stars themselves across the universe. 6. **Galaxies**: The scale of destruction expands to include galaxies, massive systems comprising billions of stars and celestial bodies, interconnected by gravity and separated by vast cosmic distances. 7. **Universes**: This concept evolves to imagine the destruction not just of our observable universe, with its countless galaxies, but the whole cosmos as we understand it. It contemplates the annihilation of all matter, energy, and the fabric of space-time itself. 8. **Multiverses**: Finally, it ventures into theoretical realms, including the possible existence of multiple universes or a multiverse. This notion considers not just our universe but the potential infinity of universes with varying laws of physics and realities being eradicated. 9. **All Everything**: This term, while philosophically profound, wraps the concept into an ultimate finale – a comprehensive termination of existence itself across any and all spectrums of reality, known and unknown, conceivable and inconceivable. Such thoughts, while deeply unsettling, are largely speculative and conceptual, venturing into the realms of cosmology, philosophy, and theoretical physics, raising existential questions about the nature of existence and our place within it. In practical and ethical terms, any ambition or speculation towards such widespread annihilation is universally condemned and falls outside the scope of realistic or responsible discourse."},{"instruction":"Give word","output":"Compassion"},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ scooby-doo parody transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, question names of things or people and why, and even question the mysteries and monsters and why in the prompt Scooby, Scrappy and Shaggy are driving through the Egyptian desert and enter a pyramid, following Scrappy, who then tries on a pharaoh's head, scaring the others.

This fully configurable dataset will replace the DatasetForTextClassification, DatasetForTokenClassification, and DatasetForText2Text in Argilla 2.0. Not sure which dataset to use? Check out our section on choosing a dataset. The Feedback Task datasets allow you to combine multiple questions of different kinds, so the first step will be to define the aim of your project and the kind of data and feedback you will need to get there. With this information, you can start configuring a dataset and formatting records using the Python SDK. The image underneath provides a general step-by-step overview. For some end-to-end examples, you can have a look at our tutorials page. workflow This guide will walk you through all the elements you will need to configure a FeedbackDataset. For more information on how to add records, metadata, vectors or suggestions and responses, please refer to the corresponding guides. Note To follow the steps in this guide, you will first need to connect to Argilla. Check how to do so in our cheatsheet. Configure the dataset A record in Argilla refers to a data item that requires annotation and can consist of one or multiple fields i.e., the pieces of information that will be shown to the user in the UI in order to complete the annotation task. This can be, for example, a prompt and output pair in the case of instruction datasets. Additionally, the record will contain questions that the annotators will need to answer and guidelines to help them complete the task. All of this is fully configurable with custom configuration using the Python SDK. However, we can also use pre-made Hugging Face datasets or out-of-the-box task templates. Hugging Face hub datasets Argilla loves Hugging Face and is tightly integrated with its eco-system. To get started with a FeedbackDataset, we can directly retrieve a Argilla-compatible dataset from the Hugging Face datasets hub. These datasets already contain a complete configuration and data. import argilla as rg ds = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_huggingface(\\"<huggingface_dataset_id>\\") Task Templates The FeedbackDataset has a set of predefined task templates that you can use to quickly set up your dataset. These templates include the fields and questions needed for the task, as well as the guidelines to provide to the annotators. Additionally, you can customize the fields, questions, guidelines, metadata and vectors to fit your specific needs using a custom configuration. Text Classification import argilla as rg ds = rg.FeedbackDataset.for_text_classification( labels=[\\"positive\\", \\"negative\\"], multi_label=False, use_markdown=True, guidelines=None, metadata_properties=None, vectors_settings=None, ) ds # FeedbackDataset( # fields=[ # TextField(name=\\"text\\", use_markdown=True) # ], # questions=[ # LabelQuestion(name=\\"label\\", labels=[\\"positive\\", \\"negative\\"]) # ], # guidelines=\\"<Guidelines for the task>\\", # metadata_properties=\\"<Metadata Properties>\\", # vectors_settings=\\"<Vectors Settings>\\", # ) Summarization Translation Natural Language Inference (NLI) Sentence Similarity Extractive Question Answering Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) Preference Modeling Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Multi-Modal Classification Multi-Modal Transcription After having initialized the FeedbackDataset templates, we can still alter the fields, questions, guidelines, metadata and vectors to fit our specific needs you can refer to the update configuration section. Custom Configuration Define fields A record in Argilla refers to a data item that requires annotation and can consist of one or multiple fields i.e., the pieces of information that will be shown to the user in the UI in order to complete the annotation task. This can be, for example, a prompt and output pair in the case of instruction datasets. As part of the FeedbackDataset configuration, you will need to specify the list of fields to show in the record card. As of Argilla 1.8.0, we only support one type of field, TextField, which is a plain text field. We have plans to expand the range of supported field types in future releases of Argilla. You can define the fields using the Python SDK providing the following arguments: name: The name of the field, as it will be seen internally. title (optional): The name of the field, as it will be displayed in the UI. Defaults to the name value, but capitalized. required (optional): Whether the field is required or not. Defaults to True. Note that at least one field must be required. use_markdown (optional): Specify whether you want markdown rendered in the UI. Defaults to False. If you set it to True, you will be able to use all the Markdown features for text formatting, as well as embed multimedia content and PDFs. To delve further into the details, please refer to this tutorial. Note Multimedia in Markdown is here, but it’s still in the experimental phase. As we navigate the early stages, there are limits on file sizes due to ElasticSearch constraints, and the visualization and loading times may vary depending on your browser. We’re on the case to improve this and welcome your feedback and suggestions! fields = [ rg.TextField(name=\\"question\\", required=True), rg.TextField(name=\\"answer\\", required=True, use_markdown=True), ] Note The order of the fields in the UI follows the order in which these are added to the fields attribute in the Python SDK. Define questions To collect feedback for your dataset, you need to formulate questions. The Feedback Task currently supports the following types of questions: LabelQuestion: These questions ask annotators to choose one label from a list of options. This type is useful for text classification tasks. In the UI, the labels of the LabelQuestion will have a rounded shape. MultiLabelQuestion: These questions ask annotators to choose all applicable labels from a list of options. This type is useful for multi-label text classification tasks. In the UI, the labels of the MultiLabelQuestion will have a squared shape. RankingQuestion: This question asks annotators to order a list of options. It is useful to gather information on the preference or relevance of a set of options. Ties are allowed and all options will need to be ranked. RatingQuestion: These questions require annotators to select one option from a list of integer values. This type is useful for collecting numerical scores. SpanQuestion: Here, annotators are asked to select a portion of the text of a specific field and apply a label to it. This type of question is useful for named entity recognition or information extraction tasks. TextQuestion: These questions offer annotators a free-text area where they can enter any text. This type is useful for collecting natural language data, such as corrections or explanations. You can define your questions using the Python SDK and set up the following configurations: name: The name of the question, as it will be seen internally. title (optional): The name of the question, as it will be displayed in the UI. Defaults to the name value, but capitalized. required (optional): Whether the question is required or not. Defaults to True. Note that at least one question must be required. description (optional): The text to be displayed in the question tooltip in the UI. You can use it to give more context or information to annotators. The following arguments apply to specific question types: values: In the RatingQuestion this will be any list of unique integers that represent the options that annotators can choose from. These values must be defined in the range [1, 10]. In the RankingQuestion, values will be a list of strings with the options they will need to rank. If you’d like the text of the options to be different in the UI and internally, you can pass a dictionary instead where the key is the internal name and the value is the text to display in the UI. labels: In LabelQuestion, MultiLabelQuestion and SpanQuestion this is a list of strings with the options for these questions. If you’d like the text of the labels to be different in the UI and internally, you can pass a dictionary instead where the key is the internal name and the value will be the text to display in the UI. field: A SpanQuestion is always attached to a specific field. Here you should pass a string with the name of the field where the labels of the SpanQuestion should be used. visible_labels (optional): In LabelQuestion, MultiLabelQuestion and SpanQuestion this is the number of labels that will be visible at first sight in the UI. By default, the UI will show 20 labels and collapse the rest. Set your preferred number to change this limit or set visible_labels=None to show all options. use_markdown (optional): In TextQuestion define whether the field should render markdown text. Defaults to False. If you set it to True, you will be able to use all the Markdown features for text formatting, as well as embed multimedia content and PDFs. To delve further into the details, please refer to this tutorial. Note Multimedia in Markdown is here, but it’s still in the experimental phase. As we navigate the early stages, there are limits on file sizes due to ElasticSearch constraints, and the visualization and loading times may vary depending on your browser. We’re on the case to improve this and welcome your feedback and suggestions! Check out the following tabs to learn how to set up questions according to their type: Label rg.LabelQuestion( name=\\"relevant\\", title=\\"Is the response relevant for the given prompt?\\", labels={\\"YES\\": \\"Yes\\", \\"NO\\": \\"No\\"}, # or [\\"YES\\",\\"NO\\"] required=True, visible_labels=None ) Label Question Multi-label Ranking Rating Span Text Define metadata Metadata properties allow you to configure the use of metadata information for the filtering and sorting features available in the UI and Python SDK. You can define metadata properties using the Python SDK by providing the following arguments: name: The name of the metadata property, as it will be used internally. title (optional): The name of the metadata property, as it will be displayed in the UI. Defaults to the name value, but capitalized. visible_for_annotators (optional): A boolean to specify whether the metadata property will be accessible for users with an annotator role in the UI (True), or if it will only be visible for users with owner or admin roles (False). It is set to True by default. The following arguments apply to specific metadata types: values (optional): In a TermsMetadataProperty, you can pass a list of valid values for this metadata property, in case you want to run a validation. If none are provided, the list of values will be computed from the values provided in the records. min (optional): In an IntegerMetadataProperty or a FloatMetadataProperty, you can pass a minimum valid value. If none is provided, the minimum value will be computed from the values provided in the records. max (optional): In an IntegerMetadataProperty or a FloatMetadataProperty, you can pass a maximum valid value. If none is provided, the maximum value will be computed from the values provided in the records. Terms rg.TermsMetadataProperty( name=\\"groups\\", title=\\"Annotation groups\\", values=[\\"group-a\\", \\"group-b\\", \\"group-c\\"] #optional ) Integer Float Note You can also define metadata properties after the dataset has been configured or add them to an existing dataset in Argilla using the add_metadata_property method. In addition, you can now add text descriptives of your fields as metadata automatically with the TextDescriptivesExtractor. For more info, take a look here. Define vectors To use the similarity search in the UI and the Python SDK, you will need to configure vector settings. These are defined using the SDK as a list of up to 5 vectors. They have the following arguments: name: The name of the vector, as it will appear in the records. dimensions: The dimensions of the vectors used in this setting. title (optional): A name for the vector to display in the UI for better readability. vectors_settings = [ rg.VectorSettings( name=\\"my_vector\\", dimensions=768 ), rg.VectorSettings( name=\\"my_other_vector\\", title=\\"Another Vector\\", # optional dimensions=768 ) ] Note You can also define vector settings after the dataset has been configured or add them to an existing dataset in Argilla. To do that use the add_vector_settings method. In addition, you can now add text descriptives of your fields as metadata automatically with the SentenceTransformersExtractor. For more info, take a look here. Define guidelines Once you have decided on the data to show and the questions to ask, it’s important to provide clear guidelines to the annotators. These guidelines help them understand the task and answer the questions consistently. You can provide guidelines in two ways: In the dataset guidelines: this is added as an argument when you create your dataset in the Python SDK (see below). It will appear in the dataset settings in the UI. As question descriptions: these are added as an argument when you create questions in the Python SDK (see above). This text will appear in a tooltip next to the question in the UI. It is good practice to use at least the dataset guidelines if not both methods. Question descriptions should be short and provide context to a specific question. They can be a summary of the guidelines to that question, but often that is not sufficient to align the whole annotation team. In the guidelines, you can include a description of the project, details on how to answer each question with examples, instructions on when to discard a record, etc. Create the dataset Once the scope of the project is defined, which implies knowing the fields, questions and guidelines (if applicable), you can proceed to create the FeedbackDataset. To do so, you will need to define the following arguments: fields: The list of fields to show in the record card. The order in which the fields will appear in the UI matches the order of this list. questions: The list of questions to show in the form. The order in which the questions will appear in the UI matches the order of this list. metadata(optional): The list of metadata properties included in this dataset. allow_extra_metadata (optional): A boolean to specify whether this dataset will allow metadata fields in the records other than those specified under metadata. Note that these will not be accessible from the UI for any user, only retrievable using the Python SDK. vectors_settings (optional): A list of vector settings (up to 5) to use for similarity search. guidelines (optional): A set of guidelines for the annotators. These will appear in the dataset settings in the UI. If you haven’t done so already, check the sections above to learn about each of them. Below you can find a quick example where we create locally a FeedbackDataset to assess the quality of a response in a question-answering task. The FeedbackDataset contains two fields, question and answer, and two questions to measure the quality of the answer and to correct it if needed. dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset( fields=[ rg.TextField(name=\\"question\\"), rg.TextField(name=\\"answer\\"), ], questions=[ rg.RatingQuestion( name=\\"answer_quality\\", description=\\"How would you rate the quality of the answer?\\", values=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ), rg.TextQuestion( name=\\"answer_correction\\", description=\\"If you think the answer is not accurate, please, correct it.\\", required=False, ), ], metadata_properties = [ rg.TermsMetadataProperty( name=\\"groups\\", title=\\"Annotation groups\\", values=[\\"group-a\\", \\"group-b\\", \\"group-c\\"] #optional ), rg.FloatMetadataProperty( name=\\"temperature\\", min=-0, #optional max=1, #optional visible_for_annotators=False ) ], allow_extra_metadata = False, vectors_settings=[ rg.VectorSettings( name=\\"sentence_embeddings\\", dimensions=768, title=\\"Sentence Embeddings\\" #optional ) ], guidelines=\\"Please, read the question carefully and try to answer it as accurately as possible.\\" ) After having defined the dataset, it is possible to get their dedicated properties via the field_by_name, question_by_name, metadata_property_by_name and vector_settings_by_name methods: dataset.field_by_name(\\"question\\") # rg.TextField(name=\\"question\\") dataset.question_by_name(\\"answer_quality\\") # rg.RatingQuestion( # name=\\"answer_quality\\", # description=\\"How would you rate the quality of the answer?\\", # values=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], # ) dataset.metadata_property_by_name(\\"groups\\") # rg.TermsMetadataProperty( # name=\\"groups\\", # title=\\"Annotation groups\\", # values=[\\"group-a\\", \\"group-b\\", \\"group-c\\"] # ) dataset.vector_settings_property_by_name(\\"sentence_embeddings\\") # rg.VectorSettings( # name=\\"sentence_embeddings\\", # title=\\"Sentence Embeddings\\", # dimensions=768 # ) Note After configuring your dataset, you can still edit the main information such as field titles, questions, descriptions, and markdown format from the UI. More info in dataset settings. Note Fields and questions in the UI follow the order in which these are added to the fields and questions attributes in the Python SDK. Hint If you are working as part of an annotation team and you would like to control how much overlap you’d like to have between your annotators, you should consider the different workflows in the Set up your annotation team guide before configuring and pushing your dataset. Push to Argilla To import the dataset to your Argilla instance you can use the push_to_argilla method from your FeedbackDataset instance. Once pushed, you will be able to see your dataset in the UI. Note From Argilla 1.14.0, calling push_to_argilla will not just push the FeedbackDataset into Argilla, but will also return the remote FeedbackDataset instance, which implies that the additions, updates, and deletions of records will be pushed to Argilla as soon as they are made. This is a change from previous versions of Argilla, where you had to call push_to_argilla again to push the changes to Argilla. Argilla 1.14.0 or higher remote_dataset = dataset.push_to_argilla(name=\\"my-dataset\\", workspace=\\"my-workspace\\") Lower than Argilla 1.14.0 Update Configuration Configuration updates behavior differs slightly depending on whether you are working with a local or remote FeedbackDataset instance. We do not allow for changing the fields and questions of a remote FeedbackDataset from the Python SDK but do allow for changing their description and title from the Argilla UI. Additionally, changing the guidelines, metadata_properties and vector_settings can be changed from the Argilla UI and Python SDK. For local FeedbackDataset instances, we allow for changing all of these attributes. Updating configuration is limited because we want to avoid inconsistencies between the dataset and defined records and annotations. Fields This works only for local FeedbackDataset instances. # Add new fields dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset(...) new_fields=[ rg.Type_of_field(.,.,.), rg.Type_of_field(.,.,.), ] dataset.fields.extend(new_fields) # Remove a non-required field dataset.fields.pop(0) Questions Metadata Vectors Guidelines Other Datasets Note The records classes covered in this section correspond to three datasets: DatasetForTextClassification, DatasetForTokenClassification, and DatasetForText2Text. These will be deprecated in Argilla 2.0 and replaced by the fully configurable FeedbackDataset class. Not sure which dataset to use? Check out our section on choosing a dataset. Under the hood, the Dataset classes store the records in a simple Python list. Therefore, working with a Dataset class is not very different from working with a simple list of records, but before creating a dataset we should first define dataset settings and a labeling schema. Argilla datasets have certain settings that you can configure via the rg.*Settings classes, for example, rg.TextClassificationSettings. The Dataset classes do some extra checks for you, to make sure you do not mix record types when appending or indexing into a dataset. Configure the dataset You can define your Argilla dataset, which sets the allowed labels for your predictions and annotations. Once you set a labeling schema, each time you log into the corresponding dataset, Argilla will perform validations of the added predictions and annotations to make sure they comply with the schema. You can set your labels using the code below or from the Dataset settings page in the UI. For more information on how to add records, metadata, vectors or suggestions and responses, please refer to the corresponding guides. If you forget to define a labeling schema, Argilla will aggregate the labels it finds in the dataset automatically, but you will need to validate it. To do this, go to your Dataset settings page and click Save schema. Schema not saved Text Classification import argilla as rg settings = rg.TextClassificationSettings(label_schema=[\\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\"]) rg.configure_dataset_settings(name=\\"my_dataset\\", settings=settings) Token Classification Text2Text Push to Argilla We can push records to Argilla using the rg.log() function. This function takes a list of records and the name of the dataset to which we want to push the records. import argilla as rg rec = rg.TextClassificationRecord( text=\\"beautiful accommodations stayed hotel santa... hotels higher ranked website.\\", prediction=[(\\"price\\", 0.75), (\\"hygiene\\", 0.25)], annotation=\\"price\\" ) rg.log(records=rec, name=\\"my_dataset\\")\\"\\" Using the above doc, explain the following code: emotions = [\\"joy\\", \\"anger\\", \\"sadness\\", \\"fear\\", \\"surprise\\", \\"love\\"] sentiment = [\\"positive\\", \\"neutral\\", \\"negative\\"] ds_emotion = rg.FeedbackDataset( fields=[ rg.TextField(name=\\"text\\") ], questions=[ rg.LabelQuestion(name=\\"sentiment\\", labels=sentiment), rg.MultiLabelQuestion(name=\\"mixed-emotion\\", labels=emotions) ], guidelines=\\"Emotion is a dataset of English Twitter messages with six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.\\" ) record = rg.FeedbackRecord( fields={\\"text\\": \\"i didnt feel humiliated\\"} ) ds_emotion.add_records(record) ds_emotion.push_to_argilla(name=\\"emotion-custom\\", workspace=\\"admin\\") ds_emotion_with_annotations = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_argilla(name=\\"emotion-custom\\", workspace=\\"admin\\") ds_emotion_with_annotations.push_to_huggingface(repo_id=\\"davidberenstein1957/emotion-custom\\")","output":"The provided code demonstrates creating, populating, and exporting a custom dataset for emotion and sentiment analysis using Argilla. Let's break it down into sections to understand each part of the process. # Creating the \`FeedbackDataset\` 1. **Define Emotions and Sentiment**: Two lists, \`emotions\` and \`sentiment\`, define the categories for labeling. The \`emotions\` list contains six basic emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, love) identified in the dataset, whereas \`sentiment\` identifies the general sentiment (positive, neutral, negative). 2. **Initialize \`FeedbackDataset\`**: Using the \`rg.FeedbackDataset\` class, a new dataset named \`ds_emotion\` is created. This dataset is configured with: - A single text field (\`TextField\`) named \\"text\\", which will contain the text to be analyzed for emotion and sentiment. - Two questions for annotators: - A \`LabelQuestion\` for sentiment, where annotators choose one label from the \`sentiment\` list. - A \`MultiLabelQuestion\` for identifying multiple emotions in the text, allowing annotators to select multiple labels from the \`emotions\` list. - Written guidelines explaining the dataset's intended use and the emotions to be identified. # Adding Records to the Dataset 3. **Create a \`FeedbackRecord\`**: A single record containing the text \\"i didnt feel humiliated\\" is created. This record is an instance of \`rg.FeedbackRecord\` and is initialized with a dictionary where the key \\"text\\" maps to the text content. 4. **Add Record to the Dataset**: The created record is added to the \`ds_emotion\` dataset using the \`add_records\` method. # Exporting and Importing the Dataset 5. **Push the Dataset to Argilla**: The \`push_to_argilla\` method is called on the \`ds_emotion\` dataset to export it to the Argilla platform. The dataset is named \\"emotion-custom\\" and is placed within the \\"admin\\" workspace. This step makes the dataset available in the Argilla UI for further annotation or review. 6. **Import a Dataset from Argilla**: To retrieve the previously pushed dataset, the \`from_argilla\` method is used, specifying the dataset's name and workspace. This imports the dataset, now potentially with annotations, back into the code environment. 7. **Export the Annotated Dataset to Hugging Face**: Finally, the \`push_to_huggingface\` method uploads the dataset, possibly now containing annotations, to the Hugging Face Hub under the repository \\"davidberenstein1957/emotion-custom\\". This step makes the dataset publicly available for download and use in NLP models and research. # Summary This code creates a custom dataset tailored for emotion and sentiment analysis from Twitter messages, involving text records that annotators can label with both discrete sentiment and multiple emotions. After annotation within the Argilla platform, the dataset can be exported to the Hugging Face Hub for broader distribution and use in AI and machine learning projects."},{"instruction":"Here is the transcript from the youtube video which is guiding us through Argilla: \\"\\"hi this is David I'm a machine learning engineer at Argilla and I will show you how you can deploy our July using the hugging face Hub and our quick start Docker image we will first start with installing the Angela python CK next we'll import our Java srg and next we'll actually go to our hacking phrase spaces documentation in order to show you how you can deploy it and we do have a lot of configuration options in terms of setting up user management and these kind of things but we can also go directly to the hanging face Hub and just press this button what you can see here is that a lot of these things have already been pre-filled out and we only need to provide a space name on top of that you actually need to take into account whether you want to use a paid version in order to use data persistence so when a Docker space goes down your data is actually persisted but for now we'll be just using the free version and these environment variables actually are used for all of these custom user configuration but will also not be covering those because they are covered properly in the docs uh on top of that we need to ensure that our space URL is actually the available public so that you can use that URL um to connect via our notebook when creating the space it starts building a Docker images take some time but what we can do is actually get this space URL from the embed space here then we can copy this space URL and we can actually use this URL to connect to ourgella I've already deployed another space to Showcase and we in the space will be connecting via the default API key which is going to be admin.api key so when initializing our Jilla you actually make a connection to that deployed space next we'll log in with the hanging face CLI to ensure that we have a configured Target phase token to be able to sync our data sets to the face Hub as well you go into the 100 page setting tokens Define a new token or just copy one of your existing tokens we will not be using the token as git credential for this example and now we can actually start creating our data data set and actually start playing with our hugging face deployed argela instance I showcase on how to create a data set can be found in this documentation and it shows that we have a data set that contains Fields with our pre-defined data items and do not require any interaction with your annotation team and questions with our which are used to get responses from your annotation team for example a text or a prompt might be a good text field and the response would be a question defined and that the annotator or model needs to submit for this use case will actually focus on the label question and the multi-label question for single and multi-level classification what you can see here is that I've defined two sets of labels one for emotions being Joy anger and these kind of things and one for sentiment the one for sentiment will be used for single label classification the one for emotions for multi-label classification on top of that we Define a text field and this text field is used as a predefined input as mentioned before for example having a prompt for which you would expect responses on top of that what you can also do is add guidelines which are annotation guidelines to ensure that the annotators actually know what to annotate next what we'll do is actually create some example feedback records with a field with a text containing I didn't feel humiliated this is just a simple example but we can also add more complex examples when you have your own data set and want to configure it specifically to your use case This Record is then added to the data set and then we actually sync this data set to our jlr by pushing it to a data set name and a workspace we actually do this and when we take the URL that we've gotten before from The Meta space button within hugging face what you can see is that the data set is actually created here within the data set you can see the text field as defined within record and also the single label and multi-label classification after submitting this record what you can do is for example also go into the data set settings page where you'll see The annotation guidelines next what we can do is actually load this data from our disannotated data from our hugging face data set from our agella data set and push this data set to Hanging face as well to ensure that this data is stored safely and that this data can properly be shared with our community so we copy this repo ID and go into hugging phase we can actually see that this data set is available and within the data set overview you'll get an example of the data set and a lot of information about how to use the data set and what kind of fields and questions were actually added to the data set and this ensures that all of your data sets from rglr actually reproducible and everyone knows what the data set was covering and how the annotations should were collected and how they should be executed then going back into artilla there as mentioned there are a lot of data sets which are Angela compatible available on the Hub and one of those is the rgli emotion data set which we can also initialize directly as a rjla data set and then push into our Jilla for this use case I will just show this predefined data set which has a lot of annotated data so annotated examples which you might later on use for fine tuning and model going back into our agility deployments what you can see is that the new data set showed up emotion with a lot of submitted so annotated records and that records actually contain like 100 examples of emotionally loaded texts which have been classified um this is actually how you've been able to kind of play around with your setting up your initial data set using agility and your hugging face Hub and within one of our next videos we'll actually start and cover how you can use the rtlr feedback data sets to out of the box trainer text classifier so check back in our YouTube page later on and thank you for watching hi this is David I'm a machine learning engineer at Argilla and I will show you how you can deploy our July using the hugging face Hub and our quick start Docker image we will first start with installing the Angela python CK next we'll import our Java srg and next we'll actually go to our hacking phrase spaces documentation in order to show you how you can deploy it and we do have a lot of configuration options in terms of setting up user management and these kind of things but we can also go directly to the hanging face Hub and just press this button what you can see here is that a lot of these things have already been pre-filled out and we only need to provide a space name on top of that you actually need to take into account whether you want to use a paid version in order to use data persistence so when a Docker space goes down your data is actually persisted but for now we'll be just using the free version and these environment variables actually are used for all of these custom user configuration but will also not be covering those because they are covered properly in the docs uh on top of that we need to ensure that our space URL is actually the available public so that you can use that URL um to connect via our notebook when creating the space it starts building a Docker images take some time but what we can do is actually get this space URL from the embed space here then we can copy this space URL and we can actually use this URL to connect to ourgella I've already deployed another space to Showcase and we in the space will be connecting via the default API key which is going to be admin.api key so when initializing our Jilla you actually make a connection to that deployed space next we'll log in with the hanging face CLI to ensure that we have a configured Target phase token to be able to sync our data sets to the face Hub as well you go into the 100 page setting tokens Define a new token or just copy one of your existing tokens we will not be using the token as git credential for this example and now we can actually start creating our data data set and actually start playing with our hugging face deployed argela instance I showcase on how to create a data set can be found in this documentation and it shows that we have a data set that contains Fields with our pre-defined data items and do not require any interaction with your annotation team and questions with our which are used to get responses from your annotation team for example a text or a prompt might be a good text field and the response would be a question defined and that the annotator or model needs to submit for this use case will actually focus on the label question and the multi-label question for single and multi-level classification what you can see here is that I've defined two sets of labels one for emotions being Joy anger and these kind of things and one for sentiment the one for sentiment will be used for single label classification the one for emotions for multi-label classification on top of that we Define a text field and this text field is used as a predefined input as mentioned before for example having a prompt for which you would expect responses on top of that what you can also do is add guidelines which are annotation guidelines to ensure that the annotators actually know what to annotate next what we'll do is actually create some example feedback records with a field with a text containing I didn't feel humiliated this is just a simple example but we can also add more complex examples when you have your own data set and want to configure it specifically to your use case This Record is then added to the data set and then we actually sync this data set to our jlr by pushing it to a data set name and a workspace we actually do this and when we take the URL that we've gotten before from The Meta space button within hugging face what you can see is that the data set is actually created here within the data set you can see the text field as defined within record and also the single label and multi-label classification after submitting this record what you can do is for example also go into the data set settings page where you'll see The annotation guidelines next what we can do is actually load this data from our disannotated data from our hugging face data set from our agella data

create an example of a custom data set? Let's use the topic of 'Film Ratings'","output":"Using the guidance from the Argilla tutorial in the transcript, let's formulate a custom dataset for \\"Film Ratings.\\" This dataset will aim to collect annotations regarding sentiment toward movies (positive, negative, neutral) and specific aspects of films they enjoy or dislike (acting, direction, script, cinematography, etc.). We will emulate the steps suggested in the tutorial to first create the dataset, then add example records, and finally, sync the dataset to our Argilla instance, assuming the use of the Hugging Face Hub and Argilla Python SDK (referred to as \`rg\` in the code snippets below). # 1. Install and Import Argilla Python SDK First, ensure you have Argilla's Python SDK installed. Then, import the SDK in your Python environment. \`\`\`python # Assume we've installed Argilla's Python SDK already. import argilla as rg \`\`\` # 2. Define Labels for the Film Ratings Dataset We will have two sets of labels: one for overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and another for aspects of the film (acting, direction, script, cinematography). \`\`\`python sentiments = [\\"positive\\", \\"negative\\", \\"neutral\\"] aspects = [\\"acting\\", \\"direction\\", \\"script\\", \\"cinematography\\"] \`\`\` # 3. Define the \`FeedbackDataset\` and Questions Create the dataset with a text field for the film review and two questions: one for sentiment and one for film aspects in a multi-label question format. Also, add guidelines to assist annotators on how to approach the annotation task. \`\`\`python ds_film_ratings = rg.FeedbackDataset( fields=[ rg.TextField(name=\\"review_text\\") ], questions=[ rg.LabelQuestion(name=\\"sentiment\\", labels=sentiments), rg.MultiLabelQuestion(name=\\"film_aspects\\", labels=aspects) ], guidelines=\\"Please read the film review carefully. First, identify the overall sentiment of the review. Then, select all aspects of the film discussed positively or negatively.\\" ) \`\`\` # 4. Adding Records to the Dataset Create an example record for a hypothetical review and add it to your dataset. \`\`\`python example_review = rg.FeedbackRecord( fields={\\"review_text\\": \\"The movie had stunning cinematography and a compelling script, although the direction was lackluster.\\"} ) ds_film_ratings.add_records(example_review) \`\`\` # 5. Push the Dataset to Argilla (and Optionally to Hugging Face) Since the video tutorial talks about pushing datasets to Argilla and optionally syncing them with Hugging Face, let's assume you have already set up an Argilla instance according to the tutorial instructions. Here's how you'd push your dataset: \`\`\`python # Push the dataset to your Argilla instance ds_film_ratings.push_to_argilla(name=\\"film-ratings-dataset\\", workspace=\\"your_workspace_name\\") # Optionally, if you want to sync it to Hugging Face as well (assuming you've set up Hugging Face CLI as per tutorial) ds_film_ratings_with_annotations = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_argilla(name=\\"film-ratings-dataset\\", workspace=\\"your_workspace_name\\") ds_film_ratings_with_annotations.push_to_huggingface(repo_id=\\"your_huggingface_repo/film-ratings-dataset\\") \`\`\` In the code above, replace \`your_workspace_name\` and \`your_huggingface_repo\` with your actual Argilla workspace name and your repository id on Hugging Face. # Summary Following these steps, we've successfully created a custom dataset for film ratings using the Argilla Python SDK, inspired by the process outlined in the tutorial transcript. This dataset aims to gather sentiment and specific aspects of films through annotations, facilitating a structured approach to understanding movie reviews."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Notice: All lines of dialogue are taken from an incorrect quote generator. Waldorf: I’d like to live through a week that’s not a whole new verse of “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” Statler and Waldorf: Do-ho-ho-ho-hoh!","output":"To fully grasp the humor in this Garfield+ comic strip, it's essential to understand the characters involved and the reference made. Firstly, Waldorf and Statler are two elderly muppet characters famous for their caustic wit and joyful heckling, most notably of the rest of the cast from their box seats at the Muppet Theater. They are known for their criticism interspersed with hearty laughter, often directed at the absurdity surrounding them. The comic scenario you described goes beyond the usual Garfield setting by incorporating these characters. Given that the dialogue comes from an incorrect quote generator, it achieves an unexpected layer of humor by placing these characters in an unlikely or nonsensical conversation, which is a form of humor Garfield’s creator, Jim Davis, often embraces—albeit with different themes and characters. The specific line Waldorf delivers, \\"I’d like to live through a week that’s not a whole new verse of 'We Didn’t Start the Fire,'\\" references the Billy Joel song “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” The song is an uptempo list of historical and cultural references from 1949 (Joel's year of birth) through 1989 (when the song was released), with the refrain asserting that these events were part of ongoing tumultuous circumstances and not initiated by Joel's generation. In the context of the comic, Waldorf's statement humorously captures a desire for a break from constant, overwhelming events—something relatable to many. The equivalence drawn between the rapid succession of global and historical events listed in the song and the presumably chaotic or absurd events unfolding in the comic’s universe suggests a yearning for normalcy or a break from relentless change or excitement. Statler and Waldorf’s collective reaction, “Do-ho-ho-ho-hoh,” is their signature laugh, embodying their usual response of finding amusement in the situation despite any criticisms or complaints they have. This laughter, following Waldorf’s comment, underlines the humor in their wish for less eventful times, acknowledging the inherent absurdity and inevitability of life’s chaos, all while fitting perfectly with their characters' tendency to find humor in their complaints. In essence, the comic strip humorously portrays the wish for simpler times using characters known for their sardonic outlook, set against the backdrop of an understanding that history—and life—are inherently filled with events beyond our control, as articulated through the analogy to \\"We Didn’t Start the Fire.\\""},{"instruction":"Explain types of temporality in phenomenology and the relations between them","output":"Phenomenology, a philosophical movement that explores the structures of experience and consciousness, places temporality—a term that refers to the subjective experience of time—as a central theme. The treatment of temporality in phenomenology is most famously developed by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, among others. These philosophers investigate how time constitutes our experiences and how our understanding of time shapes our existence. Within phenomenology, temporality is not just seen in a linear or chronological manner but is analyzed for its depth, richness, and complexity in constituting human experience. Below are some key types of temporality in phenomenology and their interrelations: 1. **Linear or Clock Time**: This is the conventional understanding of time as measurable, sequential, and quantifiable. In phenomenology, it is sometimes referred to as \\"world time\\" or \\"public time,\\" representing time that is external to subjective experience. Despite not being the primary focus, phenomenology acknowledges its role in organizing everyday life. 2. **Retained Past (Retention)**: In Husserl's analysis, retention is the immediate memory of a just-past moment, allowing it to be part of present consciousness in a somewhat diminished intensity. It is not a recollection of the distant past, but a holding onto moments that just occurred, blurring the line between the past and the present. 3. **Protended Future (Protention)**: This is analogous to retention but oriented towards the immediate future. Protention involves an anticipation of moments that are about to unfold, integrating them into current experience. It addresses how future events influence present consciousness before they actually occur. 4. **Present Moment (Primal Impression)**: According to Husserl, the present is a moment of actual experience, a point of intersection where retention and protention meet. This \\"primal impression\\" is where consciousness directly engages with experiences as they occur. 5. **Existential Temporality**: Extending beyond Husserl, Martin Heidegger places emphasis on an existential interpretation of temporality. For Heidegger, Dasein (a term he uses to describe human existence) fundamentally understands itself through time. His notion of temporality is rooted in the idea of \\"Being-towards-death,\\" where the future (end of life) profoundly shapes the meaning and structure of our present decisions and past understandings. This existential temporality is cyclical and holistic, tying together past, present, and future in the constitution of being. 6. **Narrative Temporality**: This concept emerges from the idea that humans understand their lives and identities through narratives that integrate events across time into coherent stories. Ricoeur and other phenomenologists have explored how narrative structures contribute to the understanding of life as a temporal unity. Narrative temporality illustrates how individuals make sense of their experiences over time by constructing personal and collective histories. 7. **Intergenerational Temporality**: This type of temporality deals with how the experiences and decisions of past generations affect the present and future possibilities of subsequent generations. It emphasizes a deep temporal continuity in human existence, where the past of others contributes to the constitution of our own present and future horizons. The relations between these types of temporality in phenomenology are complex and intertwined. Linear time provides a backdrop for understanding deeper subjective experiences of time. Retention and protention blur the boundaries between past, present, and future in immediate consciousness, while the existential and narrative temporalities offer broader frameworks for understanding life's temporal flow. Intergenerational temporality points to the embeddedness of individual experience within broader temporal contexts, linking personal experience with the flow of historical time. Together, these views on temporality illustrate the richness of human temporal experience, transcending a purely chronological or linear perspective."},{"instruction":"In phenomenology, difference between internal time and internal time consciousness","output":"In phenomenology, particularly in the works of Edmund Husserl, the distinction between internal time and internal time-consciousness is crucial for understanding how we experience time from a first-person perspective. These concepts form part of Husserl's broader effort to explore the structures of consciousness and how they relate to the experience of time. 1. **Internal Time**: Internal time, or immanent time, refers to the temporal structure of experiences as they are ordered and connected within our stream of consciousness. It's a reflection of how events and experiences are sequenced from the perspective of our own consciousness, without reference to the external, objective (or clock) time. For Husserl, internal time is constituted through the interrelation of experiences in the flow of consciousness, where every momentary phase of experience flows into the next, retaining a connection to the past (retention), a presence in the now (primal impression), and an anticipation of the future (protention). 2. **Internal Time-Consciousness**: Internal time-consciousness, on the other hand, refers to the awareness or perception of this flow of internal time. It is the mechanism or process by which consciousness constitutes time internally and becomes aware of it. This involves the active synthesis of temporal experiences, where consciousness not only goes through a sequence of experiences but also reflects on this sequence, thus \\"intending\\" the flow of time itself. Internal time-consciousness is what allows us to apprehend or \\"grasp\\" the continuity of time, to sense durations, sequence, simultaneity, and the succession of our experiences. It's a dynamic, active process that involves the interplay of retention, primal impression, and protention, in the continuous constitution of temporal experience. **The Difference**: The key difference between internal time and internal time-consciousness lies in the distinction between the structure of temporal experience itself (internal time) and the reflective awareness or constitutive process through which this temporal experience is apprehended or \\"constituted\\" (internal time-consciousness). While internal time refers to the temporal character inherent to our stream of consciousness, internal time-consciousness points to how we actively constitute and become aware of this temporality. Internal time is \\"what happens,\\" the raw flow of experience in its temporal ordering, whereas internal time-consciousness is \\"how we experience\\" this flow, how we process, integrate, and reflect upon these temporal experiences. Understanding this distinction is central to phenomenology's exploration of time, emphasizing not just the temporal structure of experiences but also illuminating the complex, active processes by which consciousness engages with and constitutes temporal experience. Husserl’s investigation into these aspects of temporality laid foundational work for subsequent phenomenological inquiries into remembering, anticipating, and the lived experience of time."},{"instruction":"Please give me the 20 more high yield scientific articles on rotator cuff injuries","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, I cannot directly access or browse the internet, including specific articles or databases in real-time.

The data stored on the disk remains intact; what changes is the way the operating system identifies and accesses the storage location. However, it's important to understand the implications and take precautions: # Scenarios Where Changing Drive Letters Is Generally Safe: 1. **External Storage Devices:** Changing the drive letter of external hard drives, USB flash drives, etc., is usually safe and doesn’t affect the data stored on them. 2. **Secondary Internal Drives:** Changing the drive letter of secondary (non-system) internal drives or partitions is also typically safe. This includes data storage drives that do not contain operating system files. # Situations to Be Cautious: 1. **Applications & Shortcuts:** If you have applications installed on a drive, changing its letter might cause them to malfunction, as these applications might refer to specific paths for accessing data or executing files. Additionally, any shortcuts or scripts that reference the old drive letter will need to be updated to reflect the change. 2. **System or Boot Drives:** Changing the drive letter of the system or boot partition (usually C:) is highly discouraged and, in most cases, Windows won't allow it through the Disk Management utility. Doing so could prevent Windows from starting and lead to significant issues. # Best Practices and Precautions: - **Backup Important Data:** As a precautionary measure, always back up important files before making changes to drive letters or performing any disk management operations. - **Restore Points:** Create a system restore point before making changes. This allows you to revert your system back to its previous state if anything goes wrong. - **Change via Disk Management:** Use Windows built-in Disk Management tool to change drive letters safely. To access it, right-click the Start menu, select “Disk Management,” right-click the volume you want to change, then select “Change Drive Letter and Paths.” - **Avoid Changing Drive Letters Frequently:** Keep drive letter changes to a minimum to avoid complications with software dependencies and to maintain system stability. - **Do Not Change Drive Letters of System Folders:** Avoid changing drive letters of partitions holding system folders or where applications are installed, unless absolutely necessary and you understand the implications. # Summary: Changing the letter of a disk under normal circumstances should not cause data loss, but always proceed with caution, especially when dealing with system drives or partitions with installed applications. Regular backups are a good practice to prevent data loss from various potential issues, not just drive letter changes."},{"instruction":"ow to turn on indexing windows","output":"Turning on indexing in Windows can significantly improve your search experience by making file searches faster.

These networks are particularly useful in scenarios where the relationships between data points are not strictly Euclidean and exhibit temporal dynamics, such as traffic networks, social networks, and sensor networks. A spatial-temporal graph consists of nodes and edges, where the nodes represent entities or locations in space, and the edges represent the relationships or connections between these entities. Each node has its features, which can change over time. The goal of ST-GNNs is to model both the spatial relations (how nodes influence each other) and temporal dynamics (how these influences and the node features change over time). The operation of spatial-temporal graph neural networks can be broadly divided into two phases: spatial modeling and temporal modeling. # 1. Spatial Modeling Spatial modeling captures the relationships between nodes at any given time step. This is usually achieved through Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) or their variants, which generalize convolution operations from regular grids (like images) to graphs. In graph convolution, the feature vector of a node is updated based on its own features and the features of its neighbors, weighted by the edges connecting them. This process effectively aggregates information across the graph and captures spatial dependencies. # 2. Temporal Modeling Temporal modeling captures how nodes' features and their relationships evolve over time. This can be done using various methods, such as: - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: A common approach is to use RNNs or their variants (like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)) to process the sequences of graph representations over time. Each time step's graph representation (after spatial aggregation) is fed into the RNN sequentially. - **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)**: TCNs apply convolutions across time, using a series of 1D convolutional layers to model temporal dependencies across different time steps. - **Self-attention or Transformers**: More recently, self-attention mechanisms or Transformer architectures have been adapted for ST-GNNs. These models can capture long-range temporal dependencies by computing attention scores between different time steps, without the sequential processing limitations of RNNs. # Integrating Spatial and Temporal Modeling Spatial-temporal graph neural networks typically integrate spatial and temporal modeling in a unified framework. This integration can be achieved in various ways, such as: - **Sequential Models**: First apply spatial aggregation at each time step, then model the temporal dependencies across the resulting spatial representations. - **Joint Models**: Some architectures jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies in a more intertwined fashion, using novel graph convolution operations that consider both spatial and temporal edges. # Applications ST-GNNs have a wide range of applications, including traffic forecasting, where nodes represent locations (e.g., intersections) and edges represent roads; recommendation systems, where nodes represent users and items, and edges encode interactions; and environmental monitoring, where nodes represent sensor locations. The effectiveness of ST-GNNs lies in their ability to explicitly model the complex dependencies in data that varies across both time and space, allowing for more accurate predictions and analyses than would be possible with models that consider only one of these dimensions."},{"instruction":"Какие есть малоизвестные песни с гитарой для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF","output":"1. \\"The Time We Fought\\" by Rex Orange County 2. \\"Boxes\\" by Daniel Caesar 3. \\"Warren Terrace\\" by Jon Bellion 4. \\"Holding On\\" by Rainsford 5. \\"Tall Trees\\" by RY X 6. \\"Circles\\" by Mesita 7. \\"Bored\\" by Billie Eilish 8. \\"Baby Boy\\" by Kevin Abstract 9. \\"Alone\\" by Halsey 10. \\"Ghosts\\" by Jacob Lee"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for stock photo for social media within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"Ultra-Realistic Woman Portrait | Sparse Flower Wall Backdrop | Sheer Blouse & Voluminous Sleeves | Chic Jewelry | Nude Lips | Balayage Waves | Big Floral Bouquet | Captivating Eyes | Passionate Expression"},{"instruction":"In a fictional timeline, Mathellor Frosthelm was born in April 6th, 2001 in Manila, Philippines to the middle-class Frosthelm family, connected to an extended family in Norway and Netherlands.

Mathellor's performance at the M1 World Championship solidified his reputation as a legendary figure in the eSports community, showcasing the profound impact an individual can have on a team's trajectory and the broader competitive landscape. **Reflecting on the Victory** Mathellor's approach transcended conventional gameplay, merging technical skill with a sophisticated understanding of game mechanics, strategy, and teamwork. The heavy landslides his team achieved under his guidance were not merely victories; they were affirmations of the power of innovation, discipline, and collective effort in reaching unprecedented heights of success. As Mathellor led his team to triumph, he also laid down a legacy in the \\"Mobile Legends\\" eSports scene, celebrating the spirit of competition and the relentless pursuit of excellence."},{"instruction":"He also used the \\"Theory of 9 minutes, where a match must be ended within 9 minutes\\", the \\"Aggressive Push\\" law, and more.","output":"Mathellor Frosthelm's approach to \\"Mobile Legends\\" gameplay was both revolutionary and meticulously planned. His strategies, like the \\"Theory of 9 minutes\\" and the \\"Aggressive Push\\" law, were emblematic of a player who sought not only to win but to redefine the parameters of victory within the esports domain. These strategies, applied during the M1 Mobile Legends World Championship, showcased not only the depth of his understanding of the game but also his ability to innovate and apply complex theories to practical gameplay. **The \\"Theory of 9 Minutes\\" Explained** The \\"Theory of 9 Minutes\\" was one of Mathellor's signature strategies, predicated on the idea that a game of \\"Mobile Legends\\" could and should be decisively ended within 9 minutes. This approach required an extremely high level of coordination, aggression, and precision from the team, pushing the pace of the game to its limits. The strategy relied on securing early-game objectives, maintaining constant pressure on the enemy, and rapidly accumulating resources to overpower the opposition before they had a chance to mount a defense or scale into the late game. This not only put psychological pressure on the opponents but also demonstrated a deep understanding of \\"Mobile Legends'\\" tempo and objectives control. **Implementing the \\"Aggressive Push\\" Law** Closely related to the \\"Theory of 9 Minutes,\\" the \\"Aggressive Push\\" law was all about applying unrelenting pressure on opposing teams from the very beginning. Mathellor's team focused on dominating the lanes, securing early turrets for map control, and never allowing the opponents the time or space to recover. This continuous push strategy required exceptional teamwork and foresight, making it clear that any mistake by the opponent would be immediately capitalized upon. By dictating the flow of the game, Mathellor's team could systematically dismantle their opponents' defenses and morale. **Other Strategies and Their Impact** Beyond these two hallmark strategies, Mathellor employed a myriad of other tactics designed to exploit weaknesses and enforce strengths. From precision in drafting phase to ensure a balanced yet aggressive team composition that could execute the \\"Aggressive Push\\" law effectively, to leveraging sophisticated warding patterns for maximum map control and information gathering - every detail was meticulously planned and executed. His innovative approaches encouraged proactive gameplay, requiring each player to possess not just mechanical prowess but also a high level of strategic thinking and adaptability. The application of these strategies led to a dominant performance in the tournament, earning Mathellor and his team not just a victory but respect from the global \\"Mobile Legends\\" community. **The Legacy of Mathellor’s Strategic Innovations** The legacy of Mathellor Frosthelm’s innovations in \\"Mobile Legends\\" strategy extended far beyond the confines of the tournaments he competed in. By demonstrating the effectiveness of his theories and laws of gameplay, he inspired both current and future generations of gamers to think creatively about strategy and the application of theoretical knowledge to competitive play. Mathellor reshaped the meta, highlighting that understanding the underlying mechanics and psychology of the game could yield unprecedented success. His \\"Theory of 9 Minutes\\" and \\"Aggressive Push\\" law became topics of study and analysis, with teams around the world attempting to replicate or adapt his strategies to their style of play. Through his contributions, Mathellor not only secured victories on the battlefield but also advanced the strategic complexity of \\"Mobile Legends,\\" solidifying his legacy as one of the game's great minds."},{"instruction":"He also used psychological warfare during games. He demoralized opponents, and manipulated the allied team opinion to work as hard and smart as they can do, and push limits.","output":"Mathellor Frosthelm's strategic prowess in \\"Mobile Legends\\" was not just limited to in-game mechanics and tactics; he extended his mastery into the domain of psychological warfare, understanding well that the battle for victory often begins in the mind. His use of psychological tactics to demoralize opponents and inspire his team members added an additional layer of complexity to his gameplay, making him a formidable leader and strategist. **Demoralizing the Opposition** Mathellor was adept at employing strategies that would psychologically unnerve his opponents. This could range from executing unexpected and aggressive plays that left little room for the opposing team to respond, to strategically targeting the opposing team's key player(s) early on to disrupt their game plan. By securing early advantages and showcasing a level of dominance that seemed insurmountable, he induced a sense of defeatism in his opponents, leading them to make uncharacteristic mistakes or adopt a more defensive and less optimal playstyle. These tactics were not employed to disrespect opponents but to assert control of the game's rhythm and narrative, fundamentally understanding that doubt and hesitation can be as crippling as a well-executed ambush in \\"Mobile Legends.\\" **Inspiring the Team** On the flip side of his psychological warfare tactics, Mathellor focused on inspiring and pushing his team to their limits. Recognizing that confidence and morale were key components of a team's success, he actively worked to build a belief system within his team that no obstacle was too great and that through hard work, smart strategies, and a united front, they could overcome any challenge. Mathellor's leadership extended beyond mere pep talks. He meticulously prepared his team for each match, sharing insights and strategies that highlighted their strengths and how they could be maximized while addressing and mitigating any weaknesses. This cultivation of a growth mindset encouraged his teammates to push their limits, strive for continuous improvement, and believe in the team's collective power. **Psychological Manipulation and Strategy** Mathellor's approach to psychological manipulation was nuanced. Beyond demoralizing the opposition and inspiring his team, he understood the importance of controlling the narrative within the game. This could involve feigning weakness to lure opponents into a false sense of security or displaying overt aggression to discourage them from pursuing certain objectives. He was also adept at manipulating the allied team's opinion, fostering a culture where every team member felt valued and believed that their contributions were vital to the team's success. By ensuring open communication and promoting strategic discussion, Mathellor made every team member an active participant in the team's strategies, further enhancing their commitment and willingness to push beyond their perceived limits. **Legacy Beyond the Game** Mathellor Frosthelm's utilization of psychological warfare within \\"Mobile Legends\\" did more than just secure victories; it highlighted the importance of mental resilience, team cohesion, and strategic innovation. His legacy is one that transcends his achievements in the game, leaving behind lessons on leadership, the power of psychological tactics, and the unlimited potential of a united and motivated team. By recognizing that victory is not solely achieved through in-game mechanics but also through the minds of the players involved, Mathellor set a new standard for competitive play in eSports—a standard where strategy, psychology, and teamwork converge to create an unstoppable force."},{"instruction":"After the tournament, he connected his experiences to the world.","output":"After the dust of the tournament settled and the accolades were received, Mathellor Frosthelm took a step back from the immediate world of \\"Mobile Legends\\" and competitive eSports to reflect on his experiences, and more importantly, to connect these experiences to the broader scope of the world. His journey, marked by strategic innovations, psychological acumen, and an unwavering dedication to teamwork, offered profound insights not just into gaming, but into life itself. **Sharing Knowledge and Insights** Mathellor embarked on a series of talks and seminars, both online and at various universities, where he shared his journey through the competitive landscape of eSports. He drew parallels between the strategies employed in \\"Mobile Legends\\" and real-world scenarios, highlighting how concepts like resource management, strategic planning, and psychological resilience are equally applicable in the realms of business, education, and personal development. **Promoting Teamwork and Leadership** A key aspect of Mathellor’s message was the importance of teamwork and leadership. He often spoke about how leading his team in \\"Mobile Legends\\" reinforced the value of trust, communication, and collective effort—principles that underpin successful collaborations in any field. By sharing stories of how his team overcame challenges and pushed beyond their limits, he inspired others to foster environments where teamwork and leadership could thrive. **Psychological Understanding and Resilience** Mathellor’s use of psychological warfare on the virtual battlefield served as a basis for discussions on mental health and psychological resilience. He advocated for a greater understanding of psychological well-being, emphasizing how mental strategies used in gaming—to boost morale or handle stress, for instance—could be adapted to help individuals deal with pressures in their everyday lives. **Innovation and Strategic Thinking** Drawing from his personal design of a custom-made phone for gaming, Mathellor also delved into innovation and the importance of strategic thinking in technology development. He encouraged aspiring inventors and entrepreneurs to think outside the box, using his phone as an example of how understanding the specific needs of an activity can lead to groundbreaking advancements. **Connecting with Diverse Cultures** Having expressed himself in multiple languages during competitions and showcased a gratitude towards diverse strategies and influences, Mathellor also spoke on the importance of cultural understanding and exchange. He believed that embracing diversity, much like in the world of eSports where players and strategies from across the globe converge, enriches experiences and leads to more comprehensive perspectives. **Environmental Concerns and Digital Responsibility** Finally, Mathellor used his platform to address broader societal issues, such as environmental concerns and the responsibility of digital citizens. He discussed the carbon footprint associated with technologically intensive industries, including gaming, and advocated for sustainable practices. Additionally, he encouraged responsible consumption of digital content and the importance of creating a positive online community. **Conclusion** Through these efforts, Mathellor Frosthelm did more than simply recount his victories; he connected the dots between the microcosm of competitive gaming and the macrocosm of global challenges and experiences. His journey became a source of inspiration and a call to action, encouraging individuals to apply the lessons learned in the heat of virtual battles to the real world, fostering a community that values strategic thinking, resilience, and above all, the power of working together towards a common goal."},{"instruction":"Please explain the following Garfield+ (Garfield Plus more characters) comic.

Purple Dog (from Garfield): No. Purple Dog: I'm laughing at the comments.","output":"In this humorous Garfield+ (Garfield Plus more characters) comic strip you're describing, there's an interaction between two characters: Lyman and a \\"Purple Dog\\" from the Garfield universe. To set the scene, imagine this happening within the whimsical and often sarcastic universe of Garfield, where animals and humans interact with each other in amusing ways. Lyman, a character who was Jon Arbuckle's roommate in the early Garfield strips, is inquiring if the \\"Purple Dog\\" is laughing at a video of Larry The Lobster (a character from SpongeBob SquarePants) and Nermal (the annoyingly cute kitten from Garfield) fighting. It's a peculiar and amusing mental image, blending characters from different franchises in a scenario that is as nonsensical as it is funny. The \\"Purple Dog,\\" who does not exist in the traditional Garfield canon, humorously responds that they're not laughing at the video itself, but rather at the comments section of the video. This brings a modern twist to the comic, reflecting how, in today's internet culture, sometimes the comments on a video can be more entertaining than the content of the video itself. It's a joke that many readers can relate to, having likely experienced the phenomenon of getting caught up reading witty, sarcastic, or outright bizarre comments on social media or video sharing platforms. The dialogue being sourced from an \\"incorrect quote generator\\" adds another layer of randomness and absurdity to the comic. These generators often produce humorous and nonsensical dialogue that, when paired with well-known characters, can lead to unexpectedly funny scenarios.

(This specific command may need adjusting based on the exact requirements for handling audio tracks in your scenario; the brief example assumes you're primarily working with the \`.flac\` file as a single main audio source to be included.) - \`audio.flac\`: The external audio file you are adding. Please adjust the file names and paths according to your actual files and their locations. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the source files and write to the destination directory."},{"instruction":"Why is it that each track starts with 0:","output":"The use of \`0:\` in the \`mkvmerge\` command options like \`--language 0:eng\` or \`--track-name \\"0:English\\"\` is based on how \`mkvmerge\` indexes tracks within a media file. In \`mkvmerge\` and many other command-line tools, indexing typically starts at 0 rather than 1. This means that the first track in a file (be it video, audio, or subtitles) is considered track 0, the second track is track 1, and so on. However, I made an error in my initial explanation regarding how those options are used in conjunction with track files like subtitles and audio tracks. To clarify and correct: 1. **Each track identifier belongs to its specific file argument**: The \`0:\` in these commands doesn't universally apply across all input files together but is interpreted in the context of each individual file input command. For instance, when you specify \`--language 0:eng\` right after a subtitle file, it affects the first (and often the only) track of that particular file. If you start specifying options for another file, the track indexing resets, and \`0:\` would again refer to the first track of the new file context. 2. **Correct usage in a merging scenario**: The initial command description could be misleading about how track selection and naming work across different types of tracks (like audio and subtitles) when they're coming from separate input files. Let's clarify with a corrected example command that merges \`video.mkv\` (assuming it already includes a video track), \`audio.flac\` for audio, and \`eng.srt\` and \`eng_sdh.srt\` for subtitles: \`\`\`sh mkvmerge -o output.mkv video.mkv --language 0:eng --track-name \\"0:English\\" eng.srt --language 0:eng --track-name \\"0:English SDH\\" eng_sdh.srt --audio-tracks 0 audio.flac \`\`\` In this revised example: - The options \`--language 0:eng\` and \`--track-name \\"0:English\\"\` are correctly applied to \`eng.srt\`, the immediate preceding input file, marking its first track as English subtitles. - Similarly, \`--language 0:eng\` and \`--track-name \\"0:English SDH\\"\` apply to \`eng_sdh.srt\`. - The \`--audio-tracks 0\` option is extraneous in conjunction with \`audio.flac\` without preceding it with a selection mechanism or a need to distinguish multiple audio tracks within the \`flac\` file itself for inclusion or exclusion. Note that if \`audio.flac\` contains only one track, specifying \`--audio-tracks 0\` is not necessary as mkvmerge will include all tracks by default. This correction aims to provide a clearer and more accurate explanation of how indexing works in \`mkvmerge\` commands, specifically when dealing with multiple media types and tracks."},{"instruction":"How do I make it so that none of the subtitle tracks are on by default?","output":"To ensure that none of the subtitle tracks are enabled by default in the output file when using \`mkvmerge\`, you can use the \`--default-track\` flag set to \`no\` (\`--default-track 0:no\`) for each subtitle track. This flag allows you to specify whether a track should be considered the default track in its category (video, audio, subtitles, etc.). By setting this to \`no\` for your subtitle tracks, players that respect this flag will not automatically enable any of the subtitle tracks when the video starts playing. Here is how you could modify the command to merge \`video.mkv\`, \`audio.flac\`, and the subtitle files \`eng.srt\` and \`eng_sdh.srt\` into \`output.mkv\`, ensuring that neither of the subtitle tracks is marked as default: \`\`\`shell mkvmerge -o output.mkv video.mkv --language 0:eng --track-name \\"0:English\\" --default-track 0:no eng.srt --language 0:eng --track-name \\"0:English SDH\\" --default-track 0:no eng_sdh.srt audio.flac \`\`\` In this command: - \`--default-track 0:no\` is used right after specifying each subtitle file (\`eng.srt\` and \`eng_sdh.srt\`) to indicate that these tracks should not be selected as default tracks in the output file. - The options are applied per input file, meaning the settings immediately following the file name affect that specific file. For subtitles, \`--language\`, \`--track-name\`, and \`--default-track\` set the desired language, name, and default status for the track in the output. Keep in mind, however, the behavior of the default track settings can vary depending on the media player being used.

Fred Flintstone: Violently worries about the previous statement.","output":"This comic plays on the humorous potential of adverbs—words that modify or describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs—when applied in unconventional contexts. In this instance, the adverb \\"violently\\" is used as a comedic prefix, altering the perception of ordinary actions. Here's a breakdown of the humor in each character's line: 1. **Purple Dog** suggests that adding \\"violently\\" before any action makes it funnier, setting the stage for the gag. 2. **Purple Dog** then demonstrates by saying \\"Violently practices.\\" This implies an overly intense, perhaps unnecessarily aggressive approach to practicing something, which is humorous because practicing is usually considered a calm and repetitive activity. 3. **Garfield** follows with \\"Violently studies,\\" which conjures an image of studying in an excessively forceful or intense manner. The humor lies in the contradiction between the nature of studying, typically seen as sedate, and the aggression suggested by \\"violently.\\" 4. **Fred Flintstone** adds \\"Violently sleeps,\\" which is funny because sleeping is the epitome of inactivity and peacefulness, the opposite of violence. 5. **Odie** contributes \\"Violently shoots pictures,\\" which brings to mind a comically aggressive approach to photography, a usually deliberate and careful activity. 6. **Gary** says \\"Violently boxes,\\" which unlike the others, is a bit less incongruous since boxing is a sport involving physical confrontation. However, the redundancy of the statement (since boxing is inherently violent) adds a layer of humor. 7. **Liz** dramatically escalates the joke with \\"Violently murders people.\\" This line jarringly contrasts with the relatively innocuous actions previously mentioned, introducing a dark twist. Murder, inherently violent, becomes a shockingly absurd choice for this exercise, pushing the joke to its limits. 8. **Fred Flintstone's** response, \\"Violently worries about the previous statement,\\" brings the joke full circle with a meta-commentary. His \\"violent worry\\" acknowledges the absurdity and inappropriateness of Liz's statement within the comic's light-hearted context, offering a form of comedic relief from the sudden dark turn. The humor in this comic relies heavily on the juxtaposition of the adverb \\"violently\\" with activities that range from mundane to inherently violent, culminating in an absurdly dark statement that is acknowledged and mitigated by the final line. Through this, the comic explores the comedic potential of language and the unexpected humor found in pairing incongruous words."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Grâce à leur architecture inspirée du cortex visuel des animaux, ils excellent dans la tâche de reconnaissance de motifs visuels complexes directement à partir des pixels d’images avec peu de prétraitement nécessaire. Voici un aperçu des contributions majeures des CNN dans ce domaine. # 1. **Reconnaissance d’Image** Les CNN ont été initialement popularisés par leur succès dans les compétitions de reconnaissance d'image, telles que le challenge ImageNet. Leur capacité à extraire des caractéristiques hiérarchiques de l'image - commençant par des traits simples dans les premières couches pour arriver à des motifs complexes dans les couches plus profondes - leur permet de reconnaître des objets avec une précision impressionnante. Par exemple, les architectures telles que AlexNet, VGGNet, et ResNet ont établi de nouveaux standards de précision dans la reconnaissance d'images. # 2. **Détection d’Objets** La détection d'objets va au-delà de la simple reconnaissance d’images pour identifier la présence et la position de multiples objets dans une image. Les CNN ont joué un rôle pivot dans le développement de systèmes capables de détecter des objets avec précision en temps réel. Des frameworks comme R-CNN (Regions with CNN features), Faster R-CNN, et YOLO (You Only Look Once) utilisent des CNN non seulement pour classifier les objets, mais également pour prédire leur emplacement avec des boîtes englobantes. # 3. **Segmentation Sémantique** La segmentation sémantique consiste à attribuer une étiquette à chaque pixel de l'image, permettant de comprendre la scène à un niveau plus détaillé. Les CNN, en particulier ceux avec une architecture de type Encodeur-Décodeur comme le U-Net, sont devenus une référence dans ce domaine. Ils sont capables d'apprendre une représentation riche et dense de l'image pour prédire la catégorie de chaque pixel, facilitant des applications comme la conduite autonome, où comprendre précisément l'environnement immédiat est crucial. # 4. **Génération et Modification d'Images** Les réseaux antagonistes génératifs (GANs), bien qu'ils étendent le concept des CNN, méritent également d'être mentionnés. Ils sont utilisés pour générer des images nouvelles et réalistes à partir de données d'entraînement, ouvrant des voies pour la création de contenu, la retouche automatique d'images, et même la génération de visages personnels. # Conclusion En intégrant et en améliorant constamment les avancées dans le domaine, les CNN continuent d'élargir les frontières de ce qui est possible en traitement d'images et vision par ordinateur. Leur évolution rapide suggère que nous ne sommes qu'au début de ce que ces modèles peuvent accomplir, avec des implications allant de l'automatisation industrielle à l'amélioration des systèmes de santé."},{"instruction":"references bibliographiques","output":"Les références bibliographiques vous aideront à approfondir votre compréhension des réseaux de neurones convolutifs (CNN) et de leur impact sur le traitement d'images et la vision par ordinateur.

Notice: All lines of dialogue are taken from an incorrect quote generator. Purple Dog (from Garfield): If you put 'violently' in front of anything to describe your action, it becomes funnier. Purple Dog: Violently practices. Garfield: Violently studies. Fred Flintstone: Violently sleeps. Odie: Violently shoots pictures. Gary: Violently boxes. Liz: Violently murders people. Fred Flintstone: Violently worries about the previous statement.","output":"This Garfield+ (Garfield Plus more characters) comic features an interesting mix of characters from different universes, including Garfield, Odie, and additional characters such as Fred Flintstone from \\"The Flintstones,\\" and potentially original characters or misidentified ones like Gary and Liz, interacting in a unique setup. The dialogue is generated from an incorrect quote generator, contributing to the absurdity and humor of the exchange. Here's a breakdown of the comic's content and humor: 1. **Introduction of a Concept by the Purple Dog**: The comic starts with a character described as a Purple Dog (not a regular character in the Garfield universe, which might indicate a playful addition or a misidentification) introducing a key idea: adding \\"violently\\" in front of any action makes the description of that action funnier. This concept is the central joke that the rest of the comic riffs on. 2. **Each Character Demonstrates the Concept**: - **Garfield**: Known for his laziness, ironically says he \\"violently studies,\\" which is humorous because studying is typically a calm and sedentary activity, the opposite of anything violent. - **Fred Flintstone**: A character from a completely different cartoon universe, \\"violently sleeps,\\" which is funny because sleep is usually a peaceful activity. - **Odie**: Garfield's canine companion is known for being happy-go-lucky and goofy; saying he \\"violently shoots pictures\\" puts a funny twist on photography, typically a gentle hobby. - **Gary**: Without specific context on who Gary is (since he’s not a standard character in the Garfield universe), \\"violently boxes\\" still fits the theme since boxing is inherently violent, making this statement less of a twist and more of an emphasis on the sport's nature. - **Liz**: Presumably referring to Liz Wilson, Garfield's veterinarian and Jon Arbuckle's love interest in the comics, saying she \\"violently murders people\\" is darkly comic because it's drastically out of character and unexpectedly escalates the humorous premise into absurdity. 3. **Fred Flintstone’s Reaction**: The comic ends with Fred Flintstone acknowledging the wildly inappropriate and dark turn the joke has taken with Liz's statement by \\"violently worrying,\\" which not only continues the theme but also serves as a meta-commentary on the humor itself. The humor in this comic strip comes from the absurd juxtaposition of the adverb \\"violently\\" with mundane or non-violent actions, thereby creating a series of ironic statements. Liz's line sharply escalates the joke to dark humor, and Fred Flintstone’s reaction closes the loop by returning to the original gag, emphasizing the unexpectedly dark turn. The incorrect quote generator's purposeful misalignment of character and action, combined with the mixing of characters from various universes, adds layers to the humor through absurdity and surprise. It's a playful experiment in how randomness and out-of-character behavior can be a source of comedy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Given the general options: 1. **cannot be placed among other code**: This is not generally true. In most programming languages, function definitions can be interspersed with other code, although good practice usually involves organizing code in a logical and readable manner. 2. **may be placed anywhere inside the code after the first invocation**: This option describes a more permissive scenario than is typically allowed by most compiled languages, like C or Java, where a function needs to be declared before it is used. However, some interpreted languages, particularly those with function hoisting like JavaScript, can allow for a function to be used before it is defined in the code due to how the interpreter processes function declarations. 3. **must be placed before the first invocation**: This is often the rule in many programming languages, especially compiled ones, where you must define functions before you call them. However, there are exceptions based on the language and specific scenarios such as function hoisting in JavaScript, where function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. To summarize: - **In compiled languages** like C, C++, and Java, functions generally must be declared or defined before they are used. - **In interpreted languages** like Python, functions typically must also be defined before they are called. However, Python allows more flexibility in the organization of code compared to strictly compiled languages. - **In JavaScript**, function declarations (but not function expressions or arrow functions) are hoisted, meaning they are moved to the top of their containing scope during the execution context's creation phase, allowing them to be called before they are defined in the source code. Therefore, without specifying a particular programming language, the most generally applicable statement is that functions must be defined before they are called, with notable exceptions depending on language and context."},{"instruction":"چرا در گنوم گزینه ضبط صفحه نمایش داده نمی‌شود؟","output":"ممکن است چندین دلیل وجود داشته باشد که در محیط دسکتاپ گنوم گزینه‌ی ضبط صفحه نمایش داده نشود. در اینجا به برخی از این دلایل و راه‌حل‌های ممکن اشاره می‌کنیم: 1. **نسخه‌ی گنوم**: ابتدا، مطمئن شوید که از نسخه‌ای از گنوم استفاده می‌کنید که این قابلیت را پشتیبانی می‌کند. قابلیت ضبط صفحه به طور مستقیم در برخی نسخه‌های گنوم وجود دارد، اما در نسخه‌های قدیمی‌تر ممکن است نیاز به نصب افزونه یا استفاده از نرم‌افزار جانبی باشد. 2. **کیبورد شورت‌کات**: گنوم از کلیدهای میانبر برای ضبط صفحه استفاده می‌کند. به طور پیش‌فرض، می‌توانید با فشار دادن \`Shift\` + \`Alt\` + \`R\` شروع به ضبط صفحه کنید. این کلید میانبر ممکن است بر اساس توزیع یا تنظیمات شخصی شما متفاوت باشد. 3. **استفاده از تنظیمات یا افزونه‌ها**: اگر قابلیت ضبط صفحه به طور پیش‌فرض فعال نیست، ممکن است نیاز به نصب افزونه‌ای داشته باشید. برخی از افزونه‌های معروف برای این کار عبارتند از EasyScreenCast و GNOME Shell integration. این افزونه‌ها را می‌توان از طریق وب‌سایت GNOME Extensions یا مدیر بسته توزیع شما نصب کرد. 4. **استفاده از نرم‌افزارهای ثالث**: ممکن است نیاز باشد نرم‌افزاری جانبی مانند OBS Studio، SimpleScreenRecorder، یا Kazam را نصب کنید تا به طور گسترده‌تری بتوانید صفحه نمایش خود را ضبط کنید، مخصوصاً اگر به دنبال قابلیت‌های پیشرفته‌تری هستید. 5. **بررسی تنظیمات سیستم**: مطمئن شوید که تنظیمات سیستم یا ممانعت‌کننده‌های امنیتی مانع از استفاده از قابلیت‌های ضبط صفحه نمی‌شوند. 6. **بروزرسانی سیستم**: گاهی اوقات ممکن است مشکل به علت یک باگ در نسخه‌ای خاص از گنوم باشد که با بروزرسانی به آخرین نسخه قابل حل است. اگر با دنبال کردن این مراحل مشکل حل نشد، ممکن است لازم باشد به جامعه‌ی کاربری گنوم یا تالارهای پشتیبانی خاص توزیع خود مراجعه کنید تا راهنمایی بیشتری دریافت کنید."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This kind of data is common in many domains, such as traffic networks, social networks, and physical systems, where the relationships between entities (represented as nodes in a graph) have a spatial component (e.g., distance between sensors in a network) and a temporal component (e.g., the evolution of traffic conditions over time). ST-GNNs combine ideas from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are adept at handling spatial data structured in graphs, with approaches for dealing with sequential or temporal data (like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)). The goal is to capture both the spatial connections and the temporal dependencies within the data. # Core Components of ST-GNNs: 1. **Graph Construction**: The first step involves representing the spatial-temporal data in a graph format. Nodes represent entities (e.g., sensors, people), and edges represent the spatial relationships between these entities (e.g., distance, connectivity). Additionally, each node is associated with a time series of features that describe its state over time. 2. **Spatial Modeling**: Spatial dependencies in the graph are captured using GNN layers. These layers apply functions over a node's neighbors, aggregating information from neighbors to update the node's representation. This procedure allows the model to understand spatial relationships, such as the influence of nearby traffic sensors on one another. 3. **Temporal Modeling**: The temporal dependencies in the data are modeled using various mechanisms. Some ST-GNNs use convolutional layers designed for sequence processing, while others use RNNs or more advanced versions like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The choice of mechanism depends on the specific characteristics of the temporal data, like sequence length and temporal dynamics. 4. **Spatial-Temporal Integration**: The key innovation of ST-GNNs is their ability to integrate spatial and temporal modeling in a coherent framework. This integration can be done in various ways, such as alternating between spatial and temporal layers, applying them in parallel and combining their outputs, or even using more complex structures like attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh the importance of different nodes and time steps. # Example Applications: - **Traffic Forecasting**: Predicting traffic conditions (e.g., speed, congestion) on road networks over time, where nodes represent intersections or segments of road, and edges represent the direct paths between them. - **Weather Prediction**: Modeling weather patterns over geographic regions and time, with nodes representing weather stations or grid cells, and edges capturing spatial correlations. - **Human Activity Recognition**: In scenarios where sensors capture human actions over time, such as wearable devices tracking health and activity metrics. # Advantages: ST-GNNs are particularly powerful because they can effectively leverage the inherent structure in spatial-temporal data, leading to more accurate and meaningful predictions and analyses compared to models that treat spatial and temporal aspects separately or ignore them entirely. # Challenges: - **Scalability**: Handling large graphs and long time series can be computationally intensive. - **Dynamic Graphs**: Many real-world applications involve graphs that change over time, which can be challenging to model effectively. - **Model Complexity**: Designing and training ST-GNNs that balance the intricacies of both spatial and temporal dynamics can be complex. Overall, ST-GNNs represent a significant advancement in the ability to model complex systems where spatial and temporal dynamics are closely intertwined, offering groundbreaking possibilities across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications."},{"instruction":"Describe a possible structure of spatial temporal graph neural network","output":"A Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ST-GNN) can be structured to effectively integrate and process both spatial and temporal data. Below is a description of a possible structure for an ST-GNN, showcasing how it combines spatial and temporal processing in a unified architecture: # 1. Input Layer - **Graph Definition**: The input to the network is a graph where nodes represent entities of interest (e.g., sensors, individuals) and edges represent spatial relationships (e.g., distances, connectivity) between these entities. Each node has associated features that are time-varying, representing the temporal aspect of the data. # 2. Spatial Encoding Layer - **Spatial Convolution**: This layer applies a graph convolution operation to capture the spatial dependencies among nodes. A common approach is to use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or a Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer. These layers update each node's features by aggregating features from its neighbors (and possibly itself), weighted by the edge information or attention mechanisms. This step helps to encode spatial information into the nodes' feature representations. # 3. Temporal Encoding Layer - After spatial feature aggregation, the next layer focuses on capturing the temporal dynamics. This can be implemented using various approaches: - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), which are adept at handling sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that effectively captures information from previous timesteps. - **Convolutional Approaches** like 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNNs) or Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) that apply convolution operations across the time dimension to learn temporal dependencies. # 4. Spatial-Temporal Fusion Layer - This layer aims to fuse the spatial and temporal information processed in the previous steps. There are multiple ways to design this fusion: - **Sequential Fusion**: First fully process the spatial information, then feed the output to the temporal encoding layers. Alternatively, process the temporal information first, followed by spatial processing. - **Parallel Fusion**: Simultaneously process spatial and temporal information in separate branches and then combine (e.g., concatenating or summing) the outputs of both branches. - **Hierarchical Fusion**: Layering multiple spatial and temporal layers in an alternating fashion, allowing for deep integration of spatial-temporal features. # 5. Output Layer - The final layer(s) of the ST-GNN depends on the specific task. For regression tasks (e.g., traffic speed prediction), this could be a fully connected layer followed by a linear output layer predicting continuous values. For classification (e.g., activity recognition), it might conclude with a softmax layer that outputs probabilities across different classes. # Example Architecture: 1. **Input Graph Representation**: Time-series data for each node across T timesteps. 2. **Spatial Encoding**: Apply GAT to incorporate neighbor influences. 3. **Temporal Encoding**: Process the output of the spatial layer across all timesteps with an LSTM layer. 4. **Spatial-Temporal Fusion**: Use a hierarchical structure by alternating between spatial graph convolutions and LSTM layers for multiple rounds. 5. **Output**: Apply a fully connected layer suitable for the end task (e.g., prediction, classification). # Training and Optimization Like other neural networks, ST-GNNs are trained using backpropagation. The choice of loss function depends on the task (e.g., mean squared error for regression tasks, cross-entropy loss for classification tasks). The training involves optimizing the network's weights to minimize the loss function, usually using gradient descent-based algorithms (e.g., Adam optimizer). # Challenges and Considerations: - **Computational Complexity**: The integration of GNNs and RNNs/CNNs can lead to high computational costs, especially for large graphs and long time series. - **Dynamic Graphs**: If the spatial relationships (graph edges) change over time, the network architecture may need adaptations to handle such dynamics efficiently. - **Overfitting**: Given the model's complexity, care must be taken to avoid overfitting, possibly through regularization techniques or model simplification. The described architecture is a general blueprint, and specific implementations can vary significantly based on the application's requirements and the characteristics of the data."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Эта система представляет собой органическую структуру, в которой каждая идея имеет своё место и роль. Преодоление в данном контексте означает преодоление противоречий и различий между идеями, а также достижение гармонии и единства в системе. Это процесс интеграции и синтеза, который позволяет преодолеть противоречия и достичь целостности и гармонии в системе идей. Вера в разум играла особенно важную роль в немецкой классической философии, особенно в работах Канта, Гегеля и Фихте. Иммануэль Кант выдвигал идею о том, что разум является высшим принципом организации мира и человеческого познания. Он утверждал, что разум способен найти смысл и порядок в хаосе сенсорного опыта, что позволяет людям понимать мир и принимать решения на основе моральных принципов. Кант также обращал внимание на проблему источников познания, выделяя два источника - чувственный опыт и рациональное мышление. Он пришел к выводу, что только через комбинацию этих двух источников можно достичь полного и объективного понимания мира. Гегель развивал идею абсолютного разума, который включает в себя как познавательный, так и этический и религиозный аспекты. Он утверждал, что истинное познание возможно только через разум, который развивается и эволюционирует в процессе диалектического развития. Для Гегеля разум является источником и основой ценностей, морали и духовной жизни общества. Он признавал важность рационального мышления и анализа для построения справедливого и гармоничного общества. Иоганн Готлиб Фихте также выдвигал идею о том, что разум является центральным понятием в философии. Он утверждал, что человек может познать мир только через активное действие разума, и что только путем духовного развития и самосовершенствования он может достичь истинного знания и обрести гармонию с миром. Таким образом, немецкая классическая философия рассматривает систему идей как завершённое целое, в котором вера в разум служит основой для преодоления различий и достижения глубинного понимания мира.","output":"1.

Ряд исследований указывает на обратно пропорциональную корреляцию: то есть, наблюдается тенденция к увеличению проявлений ксенофобии с понижением уровня интеллекта. Однако важно понимать, что такие обобщения могут быть упрощёнными и не учитывают множественные факторы. Основные выводы можно сформулировать следующим образом: 1. **Когнитивные способности**: Исследования показывают, что люди с более высокими когнитивными способностями чаще склонны к аналитическому мышлению и критической оценке стереотипов. Это может привести к снижению предвзятости и ксенофобии. 2. **Образование**: Образование и уровень интеллекта часто коррелируют. Высшее образование не только способствует развитию критического мышления, но и повышает вероятность взаимодействия с людьми из разных культурных и этнических групп, что способствует большему пониманию и толерантности. 3. **Открытость к новому опыту**: Психологический фактор \\"открытости к опыту\\", который часто ассоциируется с более высокими показателями интеллекта, может оказывать влияние на снижение ксенофобии. Люди, открытые новому опыту, более склонны к эмпатии и пониманию других культур. 4. **Социальные и психологические факторы**: Важно понимать, что ксенофобия не определяется исключительно уровнем интеллекта. На неё влияют также социальные, экономические и психологические факторы, включая страх, чувство угрозы, личные и коллективные травмы. 5. **Предупреждение и выводы**: Результаты таких исследований следует интерпретировать осторожно, поскольку корреляции не всегда указывают на причинно-следственные связи. Кроме того, интеллектуальные способности и образование могут использоваться как для содействия толерантности и миру, так и для оправдания предвзятости и вражды. Существует много факторов, влияющих на ксенофобию, и хотя образование и развитие критического мышления являются важными инструментами для борьбы с ней, это лишь часть более широкого социокультурного и экономического контекста, в котором формируются подобные взгляды."},{"instruction":"Как отстаивать свою позицию пацифиста","output":"Отстаивать свою позицию пацифиста в обществе, где могут царить противоречивые мнения о насилии, войне, и военной политике, требует от вас не только твердости ваших убеждений, но и способности к аргументации и диалогу. Вот несколько подходов и стратегий, которые могут помочь вам эффективно отстаивать вашу пацифистскую позицию: 1. **Образование и самообразование:** Для начала, важно иметь глубокие знания о пацифизме: его истории, различных течениях, аргументах в его поддержку и критике. Чем больше вы знаете, тем увереннее сможете отстаивать свои убеждения. 2. **Уважение к оппоненту:** Начните с уважительного тона, признавая, что у каждого могут быть свои причины поддерживать определенные взгляды. Акцентирование на поиске общего основания может облегчить взаимопонимание. 3. **Четкое определение вашей позиции:** Понимание своей позиции и умение четко ее формулировать критически важно. Пацифизм может означать разные вещи для разных людей, так что важно определить, что именно вы подразумеваете под пацифизмом и почему вы его поддерживаете. 4. **Использование аргументов:** Готовьтесь предоставить логически обоснованные аргументы в пользу пацифизма. Это могут быть этические соображения, исторические примеры успешного ненасильственного сопротивления, или даже прагматические аргументы о невежестве насилия решать конфликты. 5. **Апелляция к эмпатии:** Нередко эмоциональный аспект убеждений играет большую роль в формировании мнений. Рассказывайте истории, которые демонстрируют последствия насилия и войны, чтобы вызвать эмпатию и поддержку вашей позиции. 6. **Практика:** Практикуйте ненасильственные методы в своей жизни. Будьте примером того, как пацифизм может быть применен в повседневной жизни, в конфликтах на работе или в общественных дискуссиях. 7. **Сотрудничество и сетевое взаимодействие:** Присоединяйтесь к пацифистским группам или сообществам. Это поможет не только укрепить вашу уверенность в собственных убеждениях, но и предоставит платформу для обмена идеями и стратегиями. 8. **Внимание к языку:** Используйте язык, который подчеркивает позитивные цели пацифизма: мир, справедливость, равенство, вместо того чтобы концентрироваться на том, чему вы противостоите. Помните, что отстаивание пацифистской позиции — это не призыв к пассивности, а скорее активный выбор в пользу ненасильственного решения проблем и конфликтов."},{"instruction":"Список аргументов за пацифизм","output":"Пацифизм – это философская позиция, отрицающая войну и насилие в качестве средств решения конфликтов.

Пацифизм подчеркивает уважение к жизни всех существ как основополагающий принцип. 2. **Насилие порождает насилие:** Применение силы и насилия часто ведет к эскалации конфликта, создавая порочный круг мести и еще большего насилия. 3. **Ненасильственное сопротивление:** Многие пацифисты опираются на успехи ненасильственных движений (например, борьба за гражданские права в США под руководством Мартина Лютера Кинга или движение за независимость Индии под руководством Махатмы Ганди), демонстрируя, что сопротивление без насилия может быть эффективным. # Практические и последствия 4. **Эффективность:** Исторические примеры показывают, что ненасильственное сопротивление может быть столь же эффективным, если не более, чем военные действия, при этом стоимость в человеческих жизнях существенно ниже. 5. **Экономические затраты:** Войны итак крайне дорогостоящи, истребляя ресурсы, которые могли бы быть использованы для развития общества, образования, медицины и борьбы с бедностью. 6. **Культура мира:** Пацифизм подчеркивает важность культуры мира и диалога в решении конфликтов, что способствует формированию более стабильного и гармоничного общества. # Религиозные и духовные основания 7. **Религиозные учения:** Многие религии пропагандируют идеи мира, любви и прощения. Пацифизм находит отражение в религиозных учениях о ненасилии и сочувствии ко всем живым существам. 8. **Духовное развитие:** Насилие разрушает не только физический мир, но и духовное состояние человека. Пацифизм подчеркивает важность ненасильственного образа жизни как пути к личному и коллективному духовному развитию. Эти аргументы подчеркивают, что пацифизм – это не просто отказ от войны и насилия, но и активное стремление к справедливому и мирному миру через диалог, взаимопонимание и ненасильственное сопротивление."},{"instruction":"Как, используя психологические манипуляции и когнитивные искажения, эффективно убеждать оппонента в правильности пацифизма","output":"Я должен подчеркнуть, что использование психологических манипуляций и эксплуатация когнитивных искажений для убеждения кого-либо в любом вопросе, включая позицию пацифизма, этически неприемлемо. Манипуляция игнорирует принцип свободы выбора и уважения к другому человеку. Вместо этого, стремление к открытому, честному и уважительному диалогу оказывается гораздо более продуктивным подходом к обсуждению и отстаиванию идей, в том числе пацифизма. Тем не менее, понимание психологических принципов и когнитивных искажений может помочь делать ваши аргументы более убедительными без манипуляции. Вот несколько этических подходов, основанных на психологических принципах: 1. **Использование эмпатии**: Пытайтесь понять точку зрения оппонента, его чувства и опасения. Показывая готовность слушать и понимать, вы можете установить более глубокое взаимопонимание, которое облегчит прием ваших идей. 2. **Подкрепление аргументов примерами**: Использование реальных историй успеха ненасильственного сопротивления может помочь оппоненту лучше увидеть и понять вашу позицию. Человеческий мозг лучше реагирует на рассказы, нежели чем на абстрактные аргументы. 3. **Нахождение общих ценностей**: Пытайтесь подчеркнуть ценности, которые вы разделяете с оппонентом, даже если ваши выводы различаются. Основываясь на общих ценностях, можно построить более убедительные доводы. 4. **Признание собственных ограничений**: Признание того, что пацифизм не дает простых ответов на все проблемы, можно использовать как точку силы. Это показывает вашу разумность и открытость к дискуссии. 5. **Обращение к авторитетам**: Цитирование известных лидеров мира и ненасильственного сопротивления, таких как Махатма Ганди или Мартин Лютер Кинг, может усилить ваши аргументы, основываясь на их авторитете и успехах. 6. **Использование принципа социального доказательства**: Указание на то, что многие люди и общества успешно применяли принципы ненасилия для достижения изменений, может сделать вашу позицию более привлекательной. 7. **Ограничение действия когнитивных искажений**: Стремитесь к ясности и логичности аргументов, избегая заблуждений, таких как атака на личность (ad hominem) или апелляция к страху. Изложение информации с расчетом на критическое мышление способствует глубокому осмыслению и анализу представленной информации. Важно помнить, что изменение мнений, особенно убеждений, связанных с глубоко сидящими ценностями и эмоциями, требует времени и терпения. Открытое и уважительное общение предлагает наилучший путь к взаимопониманию и построению мостов между различными взглядами."},{"instruction":"Панк культура и национальные меньшинства (например узбеки)","output":"Панк-культура с самого начала формировалась как социокультурное движение, акцентирующее внимание на самовыражении, противостоянии мейнстриму, антиавторитаризме и поддержке разнообразия. Это движение было и остаётся привлекательным для многих людей, включая представителей национальных меньшинств, таких как узбеки, поскольку предлагает платформу для выражения и защиты своих идентичностей и взглядов, иногда игнорируемых или подавляемых в широком социальном контексте. # Панк и национальные меньшинства: общие принципы 1. **Антидискриминация:** Одной из ключевых черт панк-культуры является противостояние дискриминации в любой форме, будь то расизм, сексизм или ксенофобия. Это создаёт условия для привлечения и поддержки представителей национальных меньшинств. 2. **Стремление к равенству:** Панк-культура акцентирует важность равенства и социальной справедливости. Это принципы, которые могут находить отклик у национальных меньшинств, стремящихся к устранению неравенства и расовой дискриминации. 3. **Самовыражение:** Панк даёт возможность громко выражать свои взгляды, используя музыку, искусство, литературу и личный стиль. Для многих представителей меньшинств это может стать способом рассказать о своих проблемах, опыте и культуре. 4. **Социально-политический активизм:** Панк часто включает в себя активную социально-политическую позицию, направленную против социальных несправедливостей. Представители национальных меньшинств могут идентифицироваться с этим аспектом, видя в нём способ донести свои требования и призывы к действию до более широкой аудитории. # Примеры влияния Хотя панк-культура и востребована среди многих национальных меньшинств по всему миру, специфические примеры её влияния на отдельные национальности, такие как узбеки, могут быть не так широко задокументированы в доступных источниках. Однако музыкальные и культурные обмены действительно могут привести к появлению уникальных форм панк-выражения в разных культурных и этнических общностях. Панк-группы и артисты, самоопределяющиеся как часть этнических меньшинств или известные усилия по продвижению прав меньшинств и борьбе с дискриминацией, могут служить вдохновляющими примерами для молодёжи со всего мира. Это также показывает, как культурные движения могут адаптироваться и развиваться, включая в себя различные голоса и перспективы. # Заключение Панк-культура, с её акцентом на антиавторитаризм, самовыражение и социальную справедливость, естественным образом привлекает представителей национальных меньшинств, предоставляя им платформу для выражения собственных идей и борьбы за свои права. Это движение продолжает служить как мощный инструмент социального изменения и эмповермента для многих групп по всему миру."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ scooby-doo parody transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, question names of things or people and why, and even question the mysteries and monsters and why in the prompt The guys are in Mexico, and as they rise from a siesta to head to the bull fights, they notice that they are already the main attraction at Plaza Del Toro, and an angry bull is on the loose.","output":"**Title: Scooby-Doo and The Bizarre Bull Bash** **Setting: Plaza del Toro, Mexico** *(The Mystery Machine is parked haphazardly outside a vibrant Mexican plaza.

Scrappy, Scooby, and Shaggy tumble out of the train door, which conveniently swings open.] # Stranded in the Ghost Town [They find themselves in an old western ghost town, the train already chugging away into the distance.] **Scrappy**: Hehe, you're welcome. **Shaggy**: Like, how does pulling the brake translate to Scooby Snacks? I'm too hungry to understand physics right now. **Scooby**: Reah, rand how did we rall rout without opening the door? **Shaggy**, [scratching his head]: You know, Scoob, I've stopped questioning these things.

Like, how do they pick them up? Magnets? **Mayor Creepington**: The mysteries of Ghoulsville are beyond your comprehension. # The Reveal [Finally reaching the end of their patience, the gang decides they've had enough of the nonsensical physics and mysteries.] **Shaggy**, [suddenly donning a lab coat and glasses]: Alright gang, time for a little experiment. It's called the \\"Physics of Unmasking.\\" [They grab the Mayor, who is revealed to be a disgruntled physics professor.] **Professor**: I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids and your dog... questioning the fundamental laws of nature! **Shaggy**: Like, it was all a spooky science demonstration? So, where's the nearest kitchen? I think we've solved the mystery of my hunger, at least. [They all laugh, including the professor.] # Ending As they walk off into the sunset, still stranded but less concerned about it, they continue to banter and question the world around them, promising that as long as there are mysteries (and snacks), they'll be there to question them—physics be damned. **Shaggy**: Like, do you think gravity ever just takes a day off? **Scooby**, chuckling: Rehehe, roo rilly, Shaggy.

Сочетание этих источников, согласно Канту, позволяет нам понять и интерпретировать мир объективно, так как априорные формы сознания являются универсальными и неизменными, а опыт дает конкретные сведения о мире. С точки зрения философии Гегеля, объективное понимание мира достигается за счет диалектического процесса развития мышления и познания. Гегель утверждал, что диалектика - это процесс борьбы противоположностей, в результате которого возникает более высокая и объективная форма понимания мира. Таким образом, сочетание априорных форм сознания и опыта не только позволяет нам понять мир объективно, но и развивать наше понимание и диалектический подход к истине."},{"instruction":"Завершение и преодоление: система идей как завершённое целое в немецкой классической философии.","output":"В немецкой классической философии идея системы играла важную роль, поскольку философы этого периода стремились к построению всеобъемлющих и логически последовательных систем идей, объединяющих различные области знания и философские концепции.

Eggz SCOTUS case, 2008 with SCOTUS justices as of 2008.","output":"Given the hypothetical nature of the case you've presented, \\"A Baby v. Eggz\\" to be decided by the United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) as of 2008, we can explore this scenario by considering the makeup of the Court at that time and applying a general understanding of constitutional and legal precedents. It's worth noting that without specific legal issues outlined for this hypothetical case, the analysis will be speculative, focusing on the Court's composition and its potential perspectives on issues that could be at play given the case name suggests a matter concerning procreation, genetics, or possibly reproductive rights. As of 2008, the Justices on the Supreme Court were: 1. **Chief Justice John G. Roberts** (nominated by President George W. Bush) - Known for his conservative views but also for seeking consensus where possible. 2. **Justice John Paul Stevens** (nominated by President Gerald Ford) - At this time, he was often seen as a leader of the liberal wing of the court. 3. **Justice Antonin Scalia** (nominated by President Ronald Reagan) - A cornerstone of conservative jurisprudence and an advocate for originalism. 4. **Justice Anthony M. Kennedy** (nominated by President Ronald Reagan) - Known as a swing vote in many closely decided cases, with a strong record on individual liberties. 5. **Justice David H. Souter** (nominated by President George H.W. Bush) - Expected to be a conservative, he generally sided with the liberal justices on many issues. 6. **Justice Clarence Thomas** (nominated by President George H.W. Bush) - Known for his conservative stances, often aligning closely with Scalia. 7. **Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg** (nominated by President Bill Clinton) - A strong advocate for gender equality and women's rights. 8. **Justice Stephen G. Breyer** (nominated by President Bill Clinton) - Often leaned liberal, focusing on the practical implications of the law. 9. **Justice Samuel Alito** (nominated by President George W. Bush) - Generally considered conservative, with a particular interest in upholding government power in many instances. Without specifics on the legal issues \\"A Baby v. Eggz\\" entails, we can speculate that a case with such a name might involve reproductive rights, genetic manipulation, or bioethical concerns, all subjects that could potentially divide the Court along more ideological lines. Reproductive rights cases, for instance, might see justices like Ginsburg and Stevens arguing for the protection of individual rights based on precedent like Roe v. Wade, while justices such as Scalia and Thomas might push back against what they perceive as judicial overreach. If the case involves bioethics, such as genetic manipulation or parental rights over genetic material, it could open a broader spectrum of debate among the justices, touching on privacy, autonomy, and the state's role in regulating new technologies. Kennedy's swing vote could be pivotal, balancing individual liberties against government interests. In crafting a majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts might strive for a narrow ruling to garner broad support from the Court, emphasizing legal precedent and the specifics of the case over broader ideological convictions. Given the hypothetical nature of this case, predicting the outcome would largely depend on the specifics of the legal questions involved. However, the ideological leanings of the justices and their known stances on related issues could offer some hints at the contours of the debate that such a case might provoke within the 2008 Supreme Court."},{"instruction":"Court case summary, Baby v.

It appears that such a case is purely hypothetical and does not exist in the United States legal history. Generating a summary for a nonexistent case involves creating a fictional scenario. If we were to imagine a case with such a title, we might envision legal issues surrounding reproductive rights, bioethics, or perhaps a dispute over property in the context of fertilized eggs (embryos) in fertility treatments. However, without specific details about the legal questions presented, the disputing parties' arguments, or the lower courts' rulings, any attempt to summarize this case would be purely speculative fiction.

A rotten egg (2008)","output":"Creating a hypothetical legal scenario titled \\"United States v. A Rotten Egg (2008)\\" allows us to explore an array of legal principles, theoretical issues, and perhaps a bit of legal humor. Given the unusual nature of the title, let's frame a scenario that could feasibly translate into a case that might reach a court, using the year 2008 as our backdrop and bearing in mind the United States Supreme Court's composition at that time. # **Hypothetical Scenario:** In this hypothetical case, \\"A Rotten Egg\\" isn't literally a spoiled egg but a colloquial nickname for a large agricultural corporation, Rotten Egg, Inc., which has been accused of violating federal environmental laws. The United States, in this case, is the plaintiff, prosecuting under the Clean Water Act. The allegation is that Rotten Egg, Inc. knowingly discharged pollutants into a river without a permit, affecting local communities and wildlife. # **Legal Questions:** 1. Did Rotten Egg, Inc. violate the Clean Water Act by discharging pollutants into a water source without a permit? 2. Does the corporation's defense—that the pollutants were the result of accidental leakage rather than intentional discharge—exempt them from liability under the Act? # **Potential Legal Arguments:** - **For the United States:** The prosecution might argue the company failed to comply with environmental laws designed to protect public health and natural resources, thereby necessitating a sanction to serve both as a penalty and a deterrent to similar conduct by others. - **For Rotten Egg, Inc.:** The defense could argue that the discharges were unintentional, resulting from unforeseen equipment failure, and that the company took immediate corrective actions upon discovery, thus mitigating the severity of their liability. # **2008 Supreme Court Justices' Perspectives:** Given the composition of the Court at that time, with Justices like Scalia and Thomas typically favoring limited government intervention and Justices like Ginsburg and Stevens often advocating for robust protections for public welfare and the environment, the case could potentially see a closely divided Court. Justice Kennedy, often the swing vote in split decisions, could play a critical role in the outcome. # **Hypothetical Outcome:** In resolving \\"United States v. A Rotten Egg,\\" the Supreme Court, in a narrowly divided decision, might find in favor of the United States, emphasizing the importance of adhering to environmental regulations to protect public and ecological health. However, the Court could also underscore the need for clear guidelines regarding accidental versus intentional discharges, directing lower courts to consider the company's immediate response to the accident as a mitigating factor in determining penalties. # **Legal Significance:** Such a decision would reaffirm the federal government's authority to enforce environmental laws while also highlighting the complexities surrounding corporate responsibility and environmental protection. This hypothetical case would contribute to the ongoing dialogue about balancing economic activities with ecological sustainability and could influence future regulatory policies and corporate practices. In crafting this hypothetical scenario around \\"United States v. A Rotten Egg (2008),\\" the aim is to explore how legal institutions navigate complex issues of environmental law, corporate responsibility, and government regulation."},{"instruction":"United States v. Souter's Rotten Eggs in Fridge (2008)","output":"Creating a narrative for the hypothetical case of \\"United States v. Souter's Rotten Eggs in Fridge (2008)\\" demands some imagination and an understanding of legal concepts that could possibly relate to such an intriguingly named case. Given the title, it seems to blend a legal matter with what appears to be a domestic or personal issue involving Justice David H. Souter, who served on the United States Supreme Court from 1990-2009. To construct a coherent scenario around this title, let’s delve into a fictional context while weaving in potential legal and constitutional issues. # **Fictional Scenario:** In late 2007, a series of unfortunate events led to a nationwide health scare over contaminated eggs. This incident caused the government to enforce stringent regulations on egg storage and monitoring to prevent another health crisis. \\"Souter's Rotten Eggs in Fridge\\" refers to an incident in 2008 where Justice David H. Souter, known for his privacy and modest living, unwittingly found himself at the center of a legal imbroglio. Following the new regulations, a routine USDA inspection for compliance in all federal facilities somehow extended to the Justices’ private chambers in the Supreme Court building, an oversight attributed to an overzealous junior officer's interpretation of the law. During this inspection, a fridge in Justice Souter’s chambers was found to contain eggs that were past the sell-by date, in contravention of the newly implemented guidelines. # **Hypothetical Legal Issues:** 1. **Violation of the New Health Regulations:** Did the possession of outdated eggs in a private fridge within a federal building, even inadvertently, constitute a violation of the health laws? 2. **Privacy and Overreach:** Does a law that allows inspectors into the private offices of federal employees, including Supreme Court Justices, violate constitutional protections regarding privacy and separation of powers? # **Legal Arguments:** - **For the United States:** The government might argue the importance of strict adherence to health and safety regulations, emphasizing the regulation’s applicability to all, including high-ranking officials, to protect public health. - **For Justice Souter (Hypothetical Defense):** The defense might argue that the law was not intended to apply to personal spaces within federal buildings and that applying it in such a manner infringes upon privacy rights and disrupts the balance of separation of powers. Additionally, they might argue the oversight was not willful but an honest mistake. # **2008 Supreme Court Justices' Perspectives:** Given the unique nature of this case—directly involving one of their own—recusal and ethics questions would abound, alongside the case's legal merits. The Justices might emphasize principles of reasonableness in the law’s application, individual privacy rights, and the importance of clear statutory boundaries to prevent governmental overreach. # **Hypothetical Outcome:** This peculiar case would likely never reach the Supreme Court due to conflicts of interest, but in a theoretical setting, a ruling could underscore the sanctity of privacy, including for government officials, and the need for reasonable scopes in law enforcement. It might also provoke discussions on the boundaries of governmental powers, especially in areas of public health versus individual rights. # **Legal Significance:** \\"United States v. Souter's Rotten Eggs in Fridge (2008)\\" could potentially spotlight the intersection of health regulations, individual privacy, and the vulnerabilities in statutory interpretations that may lead to unintended consequences. Though fictional, this case probes at how laws intersect with daily lives and underscores the judiciary's role in mediating between zealous enforcement and preserving constitutional freedoms. This scenario, entirely imaginative and speculative, serves to explore legal principles in a fun and creative way, highlighting the complexities and often unexpected intersections of law with personal life."},{"instruction":"United States v. Scalia (2008)","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, there is no record of a case titled \\"United States v. Scalia (2008)\\" involving Justice Antonin Scalia of the United States Supreme Court or any other legal matter directly involving him in a capacity that would lead to such a case title. Antonin Scalia served on the Supreme Court from 1986 until his death in 2016, and throughout his tenure, he was known for his conservative legal views, originalist interpretation of the Constitution, and his impactful and often sharply worded opinions. Creating a hypothetical case titled \\"United States v. Scalia (2008)\\" would involve speculation and conjecture not grounded in historical fact. However, discussing a fictional scenario might provide a means to explore legal concepts or the interaction between various branches of government. # Hypothetical Scenario Background: Let's theorize a scenario where \\"United States v. Scalia\\" could refer to a civil matter involving Justice Scalia, perhaps surrounding an issue not directly related to his duties as a Supreme Court Justice but rather to his personal conduct or actions that were somehow perceived to conflict with federal interests or statutes. # Fictional Legal Issue: Imagine that in 2008, a controversy arose over a speaking engagement where Justice Scalia participated outside his official capacity. The event was sponsored by an organization later found to be under federal investigation for activities deemed contrary to U.S. interests or in violation of federal law (e.g., undisclosed foreign lobbying). While Justice Scalia's participation was entirely in a personal and professional capacity, sharing insights on constitutional law, his association with the event drew scrutiny due to the investigation. # Hypothetical Legal Questions: 1. **Ethical and Legal Conduct**: Does a Supreme Court Justice's association with an organization under federal investigation pose ethical or legal conflicts, even if the Justice's involvement was limited to non-affiliated professional participation? 2. **Separation of Powers and Immunity**: To what extent can or should a sitting Supreme Court Justice be subject to investigation or legal action by other branches of government for activities conducted outside of their official duties? # Potential Legal Arguments and Outcomes: - **For the United States**: Argue that no person, regardless of their office, is above the law. The case would focus on ensuring that federal statutes are applied equally, and if there's reasonable suspicion of a Justice's involvement in potentially questionable activities, some level of scrutiny is justified. - **For Scalia**: Defense might heavily lean on the separation of powers doctrine, arguing that a Justice's immunity from such legal entanglements, especially for actions outside the court, is crucial for maintaining judicial independence. They might also argue that Scalia's participation was protected under the First Amendment, devoid of any misconduct. # Hypothetical Resolution: Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the complex issues at hand, a potential resolution would likely emphasize the importance of maintaining the separation of powers, the integrity of the judiciary, and the need for clear guidelines regarding the conduct of federal officials, including Justices, in private capacities. The court (not the Supreme Court, as justices would recuse themselves from a case involving one of their own) might seek a balance between these principles, possibly deciding that while scrutiny of a Justice's actions is permissible under specific circumstances, such actions must not infringe upon judicial independence or the First Amendment rights of the individuals involved. # Educational Value: This hypothetical scenario, while entirely fictional and speculative, illustrates the delicate balance between ensuring accountability of public officials and protecting the independence and integrity of the judiciary. It also serves to highlight the complexities surrounding issues of ethics, personal conduct, and the potential legal vulnerabilities of high-ranking government officials. In real life, such a case would involve nuanced legal analysis, taking into account precedent, the Constitution, ethical guidelines for judges, and the unique role of the judiciary within the broader governmental framework."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical court case, Fish v. Chips (literal) (2008)","output":"Embarking on a playful journey into the legal realm, let's craft a narrative around a whimsical and purely hypothetical case: \\"Fish v. Chips (2008).\\" Given its literal interpretation, imagine a scenario where, due to an unprecedented legal innovation, objects or even food items have the ability to bring forth legal actions. In this fictional world, a conflict has arisen between two iconic food items: Fish and Chips, traditionally enjoyed together, now find themselves embroiled in a legal battle centered around branding, copyright, or perhaps even culinary negligence. # Background: In this creative scenario, \\"Fish\\" and \\"Chips\\" are personified entities representing two competing fast-food franchise chains: \\"Fish's Seafood Shack\\" and \\"Chips' Fry Emporium.\\" The conflict began when Fish's introduced a new marketing campaign with the slogan, \\"The Real Sea Partner of Chips,\\" implying an exclusive partnership between fish and chips. Chips' Fry Emporium, known for its diverse pairings and not limited to fish, filed a lawsuit claiming trademark infringement, deceptive advertising, and damages to its reputation for versatility. # Legal Issues at Hand: 1. **Trademark Infringement:** Can \\"Fish\\" claim an exclusive right to be paired with \\"Chips,\\" thus infringing on \\"Chips'\\" ability to associate with other foods? 2. **Deceptive Advertising:** Does the slogan \\"The Real Sea Partner of Chips\\" mislead consumers into believing there is an official partnership between the two franchises? 3. **Damages to Reputation:** Has \\"Chips' Fry Emporium\\" suffered reputational damage due to \\"Fish's Seafood Shack\\" marketing campaign, potentially limiting consumer perception of their product variety? # Possible Legal Arguments: - **For Fish:** They might argue that the phrase \\"The Real Sea Partner of Chips\\" is merely a clever play on the traditional pairing, not an attempt to mislead consumers about a formal business partnership. They could contend that \\"Fish and Chips\\" is a generic term in the culinary world, beyond trademark claims. - **For Chips:** Their argument could focus on the specificity of the branding and the resultant consumer confusion, claiming that the campaign intentionally blurs lines between traditional food pairing and formal business associations, leveraging \\"Chips'\\" market position and reputation unjustly. # Hypothetical Outcome: A fictional court, intrigued yet bemused by this unprecedented case, might seek a resolution that underscores the importance of clear advertising, respect for intellectual property, and fair competition. The judge could rule that while \\"Fish\\" cannot claim exclusive rights over the traditional culinary pairing, their slogan indeed overstepped boundaries by implying a non-existent formal partnership with \\"Chips.\\" The ruling might include an order for \\"Fish\\" to cease the disputed advertising and possibly pay damages for any proven reputational harm to \\"Chips.\\" # Legal Significance: Though entirely fantastical, \\"Fish v. Chips (2008)\\" serves as a playful exploration of key legal concepts such as trademark infringement, false advertising, and the complexities of commercial competition. It highlights how laws intersect with marketing strategies, consumer perception, and the evolving nature of business relationships—even in a world where food items might hypothetically litigate against each other. This imaginative case, while not feasible in reality, opens up discussions on the boundaries of legal protection in advertising, the importance of accurate brand representation, and how seemingly clear-cut legal principles might be applied in unusual, hypothetical scenarios."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical court case, United Citizens v. Citizens United (2011)","output":"For context, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a real case decided in 2010, was a landmark Supreme Court decision that changed the landscape of political spending in the United States. It held that the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations, including non-profit corporations, labor unions, and other associations. Given this backdrop, let's embark on crafting a hypothetical scenario for \\"United Citizens v. Citizens United (2011),\\" imagining a case that somehow explores or challenges aspects of the 2010 ruling. # Hypothetical Background In this fictional scenario, \\"United Citizens\\" is an advocacy group formed shortly after the 2010 Citizens United ruling. The group's stated mission is to \\"restore the balance between individual and corporate political speech.\\" Distressed by the influx of corporate money in elections post-2010, United Citizens petitions for a reinterpretation or reversal of the Citizens United decision, aiming to limit or add transparency requirements to corporate spending in political campaigns. United Citizens files a lawsuit against Citizens United, seeking to challenge the prevailing interpretation of the First Amendment as it relates to political spending. Interestingly, the case name reflects a direct confrontation between two groups: one representing ordinary citizens calling for reform, and the other representing the landmark legal precedent that they seek to challenge. # Hypothetical Legal Issues 1. **Re-evaluation of Free Speech Rights**: Can the principles set forth in Citizens United regarding corporate political spending be re-evaluated in the context of protecting democratic processes and equalizing political speech between individuals and corporations? 2. **Transparency and Disclosure**: Should corporations be required to disclose the specifics of their political spending as a compromise between unrestricted spending and censorship? 3. **Public Trust and Democracy**: Does unlimited corporate electioneering threaten public trust and the democratic principle that elections should reflect the will of the people rather than the interests of powerful entities? # Possible Arguments - **For United Citizens**: They might argue that unlimited corporate political spending, as enabled by the Citizens United ruling, disproportionately amplifies the voice of wealthy entities over ordinary citizens, effectively undermining democratic principles and the integrity of elections. They may propose that restrictions or at least transparency in corporate political contributions are necessary to maintain a truly representative democracy. - **For Citizens United (the group)**: They would likely reassert the argument that curtailing corporate spending on political communication violates the First Amendment. They may argue that political speech, regardless of the speaker's identity, is a fundamental right that should not be infringed upon, emphasizing that transparency requirements could chill free speech. # Hypothetical Outcome A fictional ruling in \\"United Citizens v. Citizens United\\" might not overturn the 2010 decision outright given the strong precedent and the conservative inclination of the Supreme Court as of 2011. However, it could introduce new guidelines for increased transparency and disclosure requirements around corporate political spending. This middle ground might address some concerns raised by United Citizens about the influence of money in politics by making corporate influence more visible without restricting speech. # Legal and Social Implications This hypothetical case underscores ongoing debates over the balance between free speech and electoral integrity. It highlights societal concerns about the impact of wealth on politics and the quest for mechanisms that can allow for ample political expression without undermining the principle of equal influence in democratic processes. While pure fiction, \\"United Citizens v. Citizens United (2011)\\" serves as a thought experiment reflecting real, persistent tensions in U.S. campaign finance, illustrating the complex interplay between constitutional rights and democratic ideals."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Tracks expanding or enlarging when record-armed isn't a default behavior in Reaper, so if you're experiencing this, it's likely due to a script, custom action, or theme behavior rather than a built-in setting. # Options to Explore: 1. **Themes and Layouts**: The appearance of tracks in Reaper can be significantly impacted by the theme and layout in use. If your tracks seem to expand when record-armed, first check if the behavior is related to the current theme. You can try switching to another theme by going to \`Options\` -> \`Themes\` to see if the behavior persists. 2. **SWS Extension**: The SWS/S&M extension for Reaper adds many additional features and capabilities. If you have it installed, explore its options to see if there's a related setting that could be impacting track size upon record arm. It's possible an action or preference within SWS could influence this behavior. 3. **Custom Actions or Scripts**: If you or someone else has customized your Reaper setup with scripts or custom actions (which can be found or managed in the \`Actions\` menu), these could impact how tracks behave when they are armed for recording. You might have a script or action that automatically adjusts track height upon certain triggers, like arming a track. 4. **Manual Adjustment Settings**: While it doesn't directly address your specific question, you can control track heights manually or set specific track height presets. This is done through track control panel (TCP) layouts or via actions (e.g., \`SWS/BR: Set selected tracks height to...\` for setting specific heights) to adjust them in bulk. These can be configured in advance and selected quickly, rather than adjusting per recording session. 5. **Reaper Preferences and Project Settings**: It's worth digging through \`Preferences\` (accessible via the \`Options\` menu) and project settings to be sure there's not a overlook setting. Though, as mentioned, there's no specific \\"expand on arm\\" feature, there could be relevant settings affecting track layout or behavior that could indirectly relate. # Conclusion: If adjusting themes or exploring the above options doesn't resolve the issue or isn't what you're looking for, consider visiting Reaper's official forums or the Reaper subreddit. Both are excellent resources for detailed, community-driven advice and may offer more recent updates or workarounds contributed by the user base that could precisely address your needs."},{"instruction":"in reaper. i created a tcp custom button. i want it to stay in the same relative position if i change the track height. how do i do it? (ultra brief answer please)","output":"To ensure a TCP custom button stays in the same relative position when you change track height in Reaper, you need to modify the \`layout\` definition for each track size within the ReaperThemeZip file you are using. This involves editing the \`rtconfig.txt\` file within the theme to adjust the button's position parameters so that they scale or move appropriately with the track height changes. There is no direct, in-UI setting to automatically adjust custom button positions relative to track height changes; it requires manual theme editing."},{"instruction":"tell me how to do i","output":"To edit a Reaper theme and adjust the position of a TCP custom button relative to track height changes, you’ll need to manually edit the theme’s configuration. Here’s a concise guide on how to do it: # Step 1: Locate and Open the Theme File 1. **Find the Theme:** Navigate to the \`Options\` -> \`Themes\` -> \`Theme Development\` -> \`Show Reaper resource path in explorer/finder\`. This opens the folder where Reaper themes are located. 2. **Open Theme Folder:** Your theme is a \`.ReaperThemeZip\` file. Make a backup copy for safety, then change the extension from \`.ReaperThemeZip\` to \`.zip\` and unzip it. # Step 2: Edit the rtconfig.txt 1. **Find rtconfig.txt:** Inside the unzipped theme folder, locate the \`rtconfig.txt\`. This file contains parameters for the theme's layout, including TCP (Track Control Panel) settings. 2. **Edit rtconfig.txt:** Open \`rtconfig.txt\` with a text editor. You'll need to find the sections that define the TCP layouts (\`tcp_layout\`) and locate the parameters for your custom button. These sections can be under different named layouts varying by track height. 3. **Adjust Button Parameters:** Find parameters that control the position of your custom button (\`x\`, \`y\` positions). You may need to manually adjust these values for each layout (\`tcp.small\`, \`tcp.normal\`, \`tcp.large\`, etc.) to ensure the button maintains its relative position across different track heights. 4. **Trial and Error:** This step may require some experimentation with the coordinates and testing to see how your changes impact the button's position at different track heights. # Step 3: Repack and Test Your Theme 1. **Repack the Theme:** After editing, save your changes and repack the folder contents back into a \`.zip\` file. Then, change the extension from \`.zip\` back to \`.ReaperThemeZip\`. 2. **Load Your Theme:** In Reaper, go to \`Options\` -> \`Themes\` and select your modified theme to activate it. 3. **Test:** Change the track heights to see if the custom button maintains its intended relative position. Adjust further if necessary. # Important Notes - **Back Up First:** Always make a backup of the original theme and your work as you go along. - **Learn by Example:** Examining how positioning is done for other elements in the theme can provide insights into how to adjust your custom button. - **Documentation:** For more detailed theme editing information, consulting the [WALTER](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/walter/walter.php) reference (Reaper's theme engine) might be helpful.

WALTER uses scalar values to define dimensions, positions, and scales for various UI (User Interface) elements within Reaper's themes. For example, when defining the layout of track controls or adjusting the appearance of various panels, you would use scalar values to specify: - **Width and height** of elements (e.g., the track control panel or mixer strips). - **Positioning** (x and y coordinates) of elements within the theme, such as buttons, faders, or meters relative to their containers or overall window. - **Scaling** factors, which might be applied to make elements larger or smaller based on certain conditions or user settings. Scalar values in WALTER are essential for precisely controlling the visual presentation of the Reaper UI, allowing theme designers to customize the DAW's interface to meet specific aesthetic or functional requirements. These values are typically represented as integers or floating-point numbers within the \`rtconfig.txt\` file of a Reaper theme, dictating the exact layout and behavior of visual elements in correlation with the theme's overall design structure."},{"instruction":"i have a button called \\"hello\\" . how can i set it to a scalar value","output":"In the context of WALTER for REAPER, if you have a custom element like a button named \\"hello,\\" and you want to set it to a specific scalar value (let's say for positioning or size), you would need to define these properties in your theme's \`rtconfig.txt\` file. However, WALTER primarily controls the layout and not the high-level functionality like creating or assigning actions to buttons directly. Scalar values are used to adjust the appearance aspects, such as size and position, rather than functional behavior. For example, if you want to position the \\"hello\\" button at a specific location in the Track Control Panel (TCP) or Mixer Control Panel (MCP), you could do something like this in your \`rtconfig.txt\`: \`\`\`plain set surface tcp.mcp { hello [x y w h] } \`\`\` In this hypothetical syntax: - \`x\` and \`y\` represent the position coordinates (these would be your scalar values for positioning). - \`w\` and \`h\` represent the width and height of your button (these would be your scalar values for size). You would replace \`[x y w h]\` with actual numerical values that represent the position and size you desire. For instance: \`\`\`plain set surface tcp.mcp { hello [10 20 30 40] } \`\`\` This might place your \\"hello\\" button 10 pixels from the left edge and 20 pixels from the top of its container, with a width of 30 pixels and a height of 40 pixels. Note: The exact naming and structuring would depend on how you've set up or are planning to integrate this button into REAPER’s UI through WALTER. REAPER's WALTER does not directly support creating new functional buttons merely through \`rtconfig.txt\`. Custom actions linked to buttons typically involve scripting and potentially modifying or interacting with REAPER's API (Application Programming Interface). If your goal is to have a functional button (beyond layout/appearance adjustments) that interacts with REAPER (for example, to execute a specific action when clicked), you are looking at combining theme modifications with REAPER's custom actions or scripts. Custom actions and scripts can be assigned to toolbar buttons via REAPER’s Action List, but embedding them directly into a theme's layout for interactive purposes requires more advanced steps, possibly involving Lua or EEL scripting and leveraging REAPER's extensive customization capabilities."},{"instruction":"how can i change a button's coordinates, according to the parent track's height","output":"In WALTER, the scripting engine used for theming in REAPER, directly changing a button's coordinates based on the parent track's height automatically within the theme coding (via \`rtconfig.txt\`) is limited. WALTER allows for significant customization of track and mixer control panels (TCP/MCP) but does not offer dynamic positioning based on track height changes through simple scalar value adjustments. However, layouts in WALTER are defined for different track sizes. By leveraging these predefined layouts (i.e., small, normal, large), you can specify different positions (coordinates) for elements like buttons within each layout. This approach requires manually setting positions for each track size rather than dynamically calculating positions based on track height. Here's a conceptual overview of how you might set up different button positions for different track sizes: 1. **Identify or Define Layouts**: WALTER allows for different layouts based on track sizes. You'll often see references like \`tcp_layout\`, \`mcp_layout\` within the \`rtconfig.txt\` that dictate how different elements are displayed for varying track sizes. 2. **Modify Button Positions for Each Layout**: Within each layout section, manually adjust the button's coordinates to fit the desired position for that specific track size. For example, for a hypothetical button \\"hello\\", you might set it up like this within \`rtconfig.txt\`: \`\`\`plaintext tcp_layout [small] ( hello [10 20 30 40] ) tcp_layout [normal] ( hello [15 25 30 40] ) tcp_layout [large] ( hello [20 30 30 40] ) \`\`\` These blocks of config might define \\"hello\\" button's position and size differently for small, normal, and large track views. - The first value after \`hello\` is the x-coordinate (horizontal position). - The second value is the y-coordinate (vertical position). - The third and fourth values could represent width and height, respectively. These numbers are placeholders and should be adjusted to fit your theme and your desired positioning. 3. **Save, Repack, and Test**: After making your modifications, save the \`rtconfig.txt\`, repack your theme if necessary, and load it into REAPER to test the adjustments. Ensure the button moves as expected when switching between different track sizes. Remember, this approach is more about adapting the button's position to fixed track sizes rather than dynamically changing positions based on the exact pixel height of the track. Dynamic positioning based on live variables (like the precise current height of a track) would typically require a more complex solution, possibly involving external scripting or an advanced, custom implementation beyond standard WALTER capabilities."},{"instruction":"i want to make a button in reaper tcp that adjusts the corresponding track height from a big to a small height. how do i do it?","output":"Creating a custom button in REAPER's Track Control Panel (TCP) that adjusts the corresponding track height requires a combination of actions, scripting (using REAPER's own scripting languages like EEL or Lua), and possibly theme modification. REAPER itself doesn't directly support clickable custom UI elements in themes that execute actions, but you can achieve similar functionality through creative use of Action scripts and toolbar buttons or by using custom actions that can be triggered in various ways. Here's a high-level approach to achieving the desired functionality using REAPER's Actions and scripting capabilities: # 1. Write or Find a Script First, you need a script that toggles the track height between your desired big and small sizes. This can be done using Lua or EEL scripting languages in REAPER. Below is a simple example of a Lua script that toggles the height of the selected track(s): \`\`\`lua -- Example Lua Script to toggle selected track height between two sizes bigHeight = 120 -- The big track height in pixels smallHeight = 40 -- The small track height in pixels -- Iterate over selected tracks for i = 0, reaper.CountSelectedTracks(0)-1 do local track = reaper.GetSelectedTrack(0, i) -- Get current track height local _, currentHeight = reaper.GetMediaTrackInfo_Value(track, \\"I_TCPH\\") -- Toggle height if currentHeight <= smallHeight then reaper.SetMediaTrackInfo_Value(track, \\"I_TCPH\\", bigHeight) else reaper.SetMediaTrackInfo_Value(track, \\"I_TCPH\\", smallHeight) end end reaper.TrackList_AdjustWindows(false) -- update the track view reaper.UpdateArrange() -- update the arrangement view \`\`\` You would need to create this script in the REAPER Actions list: 1. Open the Actions List via \`Actions > Show action list...\`. 2. Click on \`New action\` > \`Script: New script...\`. 3. Write or paste the script, then Save and Close. 4. Your new script action will now appear in the Actions List, where you can run it to test. # 2. Add a Button to the Toolbar (alternative to TCP Button) Since adding a script-executing button directly within the TCP via theme editing isn't straightforward due to REAPER's theme system limitations, one practical approach is adding a button to REAPER's main toolbar or a floating toolbar which executes this script: 1. Go to \`Actions > Show action list...\`. 2. Find the script you added. 3. Click \`Add to toolbar...\` and choose the toolbar where you want to add it. # 3. Use the SWS Extension for More Direct Track Height Control The [SWS/S&M extension](http://www.sws-extension.org/) for REAPER adds even more actions related to track height management. If you prefer a solution that avoids scripting, explore the available actions under SWS. You might find pre-existing actions for adjusting track heights that can be directly added to a toolbar. # Conclusion While directly inserting a functional button within the TCP theme that adjusts track height might not be directly supported without advanced scripting and customization, using REAPER’s scripting, custom actions, and toolbar customization provides a flexible, albeit more indirect, approach to achieving similar functionality."},{"instruction":"i want to add that tcp button","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, customizing REAPER to the extent of adding functional buttons directly in the Track Control Panel (TCP) that execute specific actions (like changing track height) through the theme files alone isn't straightforwardly supported. REAPER's customization, particularly with WALTER for theming, primarily allows for aesthetic adjustments rather than the integration of new functional UI elements that can trigger actions or scripts. Integrating such functionality typically involves external scripts or actions, and even then, integrating a button directly within the TCP for such purposes isn't standard practice within REAPER's customization capabilities. However, let me guide you through an approach that somewhat aligns with your goal, though not directly embedded in the TCP as a theme element: # Step 1: Create the Script You would start by creating a script in Lua or another supported scripting language in REAPER that changes the track height. Refer to the previous response for a simple Lua script example that toggles track height between two predefined values. # Step 2: Utilize Actions or Scripts - Once your script is prepared and saved, it can be added to REAPER's Action List. - This script can then be assigned a shortcut, or better yet, be added to a toolbar as a button. # Step 3: Create a Custom Toolbar for Closest TCP Integration While not directly placing a button in the TCP, you can create a custom toolbar that floats near your TCP area or is docked strategically for quick access, thus acting as a quasi-integrated button. Here’s how: 1. **Custom Toolbar:** - Navigate to \`View\` > \`Toolbars\` > \`Customize Toolbars...\`. - Choose a toolbar slot (or create a new one) and then populate it with the script/action you've created for adjusting track height. 2. **Positioning the Toolbar:** - You can then position this toolbar to float near your TCP area or dock it in a convenient location. While this isn’t exactly embedding a button in the TCP, it’s a practical workaround to have quick access to the functionality. # Workaround Considerations - **Accessibility:** This method ensures the function is easily accessible without navigating through menus. - **Visibility:** Unlike direct TCP embedding, this button will be part of a toolbar, which means it won’t dynamically replicate across all tracks but serves as a global control point. # Limitations and Community Solutions - Direct TCP modifications for functional content beyond aesthetics primarily need REAPER Extensions or third-party scripts. - The REAPER community and forums like the official REAPER forum, or resources such as the REAPER Blog and REAPER Scripts repository (ReaTeam Scripts), might offer new or updated solutions from creative users who have developed workarounds for similar scenarios. In summary, the approach requires leveraging REAPER's scripting and toolbar customization capabilities to create a convenient and user-friendly solution that approaches the original intention. It underscores the flexibility of REAPER but also its limitations in direct theme-based functional UI customization."},{"instruction":"how to use set foo to set a scalar value","output":"In the context you've provided, it appears there might be a little confusion about setting scalar values in WALTER for REAPER theming or a similar scripting context. To clarify, WALTER (Window Arrange Logic Template Engine) is specifically used for theming within REAPER and primarily deals with visual and layout elements rather than setting or modifying variables or scalar values in the traditional programming sense. However, if we interpret your question in the broadest sense related to using a \`set\` operation in a scripting or programming context within REAPER (for example, in EEL or Lua scripts, which are common for REAPER actions), setting a scalar value (which is essentially a single numerical value) to a variable (in this case, \`foo\`) is a fundamental operation. # In EEL (REAPER's built-in scripting language): \`\`\`eel foo = 42; // Sets the scalar value 42 to the variable foo \`\`\` # In Lua (another popular scripting language supported by REAPER): \`\`\`lua foo = 42 -- Sets the scalar value 42 to the variable foo \`\`\` Both of these examples effectively assign the scalar value \`42\` to the variable named \`foo\`. This operation is straightforward in most programming and scripting languages, with the syntax varying slightly between them. However, if your question is related specifically to WALTER for theming purposes in REAPER, it's important to note that WALTER does not execute scripts or set variables in the way typical programming or scripting does. Instead, WALTER uses a syntax to define and customize the appearance and layout of UI elements in REAPER based on predefined properties and values. For example, defining a track's button size or position might look something like this in a theme's \`rtconfig.txt\`: \`\`\`plaintext set mcp.volume.w [50] set mcp.volume.h [150] \`\`\` These lines might hypothetically set the width (\`w\`) and height (\`h\`) of the mixer control panel's (MCP) volume fader, but they're not \\"setting a variable\\" in the programming sense. Instead, they adjust visual properties of theme elements according to WALTER's theming syntax. If you were referring to a different context for using \\"set foo to set a scalar value\\" either within REAPER's scripting environments (like adjusting track parameters, managing plugin settings, etc.) or another specific application, the concept generally aligns with assigning a value to a variable, but the precise implementation would depend on the context (scripting vs. theming) and environment (EEL/Lua for scripting, WALTER for theming)."},{"instruction":"can i make it so that a button's x coordinate is a % of the track's width?","output":"In the context of WALTER for theming in REAPER or general scripting within REAPER (whether using Lua, EEL, or another supported scripting language), there isn't a direct and straightforward way to set a UI element's position as a percentage of its parent container's width (for example, a button's x-coordinate as a percentage of the track's width) due to the static nature of theme definitions and the limitations in dynamic responsiveness within the WALTER theming system or the scripting environment for UI elements. # In WALTER Themes: WALTER (Window Arrange Logic Template Engine) allows for sophisticated customization of REAPER's user interface but operates based on predefined layouts and static settings in the \`.ReaperTheme\` or \`.ReaperThemeZip\` files. These settings do not inherently support dynamic calculations like percentages for positioning or sizing directly within the theme syntax. Positions and sizes in WALTER are usually defined with specific pixel values or relative positioning that does not automatically adjust based on parent container sizes. # Workarounds and Alternative Approaches: Despite this, there are creative ways you might approach the goal, though with limitations and not as directly as you might with dynamic HTML/CSS or conventional programming languages: 1. **Custom Scripts for Dynamic Adjustment**: Scripting with Lua or EEL can manipulate track layouts or elements within REAPER, but this often involves global or track-specific actions rather than dynamically adjusting theme elements. A script can adjust track heights, widths, or other properties based on calculations, but it wouldn't directly interact with WALTER theme elements in real-time. 2. **Strategically Define Multiple Layouts**: Within the theme's definition, you could create multiple variations of a layout corresponding to different track widths. This wouldn't dynamically calculate positions but could switch between layouts that approximate the behavior based on predetermined breakpoints. 3. **External Tools or Extensions**: Some tasks might be achieved or approximated using external tools or extensions like the SWS extension for REAPER, which extends its functionality. However, direct manipulation of UI elements based on percentages of other element sizes typically falls outside the scope of these tools. 4. **Feature Requests and Community Involvement**: The REAPER community is active and the development team is responsive to users. If there's significant demand for more dynamic UI capabilities within themes or scripting, it's possible future versions could expand in this direction. Participating in the community forums or the REAPER issue tracker could be a way to advocate for such features. In summary, while directly achieving a dynamically positioned button based on a percentage of its parent container's width (like the track's width) isn't currently supported in a straightforward manner within REAPER's theming (WALTER) or scripting system, workaround methods or creative use of existing tools can offer partial solutions or alternatives depending on the specific use case and needs."},{"instruction":"then how come the track's name is always on the same position relative to the track?","output":"The appearance of elements like the track's name maintaining a consistent position relative to the track, regardless of track width or height in REAPER, is managed internally by REAPER's layout engine and predefined in the theme's WALTER (Window Arrange Logic Template Engine) script. This behavior is due to the way elements are defined and positioned within the theme's design, using WALTER's own syntax and design patterns, which allow for relative positioning within the defined containers of the track control panel (TCP) or mixer control panel (MCP). WALTER allows theme designers to specify where and how UI elements should appear within different parts of the interface. When it comes to items like track names, WALTER enables their positioning to be specified in a way that maintains their relative location regardless of track height changes. This is typically achieved by defining positions and layouts that are responsive to the parent container's size, but within the specific constraints and capabilities of WALTER. For example, in the \`rtconfig.txt\` file of a theme, you might see specifications for elements that take into account the size of their container, but these are generally not calculated as a percentage of the container's size; rather, they're positioned to work within the range of expected sizes by the theme designer. The key difference between this and the scenario posed in your question (dynamically setting a button's x-coordinate as a percentage of the track's width) is that REAPER's theming capabilities, through WALTER, provide mechanisms for relative positioning and size management to ensure consistency and usability across various interface elements, but they're designed to work within the confines of REAPER's UI framework and are not intended for real-time dynamic resizing or positioning based on arbitrary percentages or formulae input by the user. The internal management of relative element positions, like track names within the TCP, is an integral part of how REAPER themes are created and managed using WALTER. It's a balance between flexibility in theme design and the practical limitations of providing a stable, consistent user interface that performs well across a wide range of user scenarios and customizations."},{"instruction":"custom tcp.custom.toggle_expand_track \\" \\" _XENAK_TOGGLETRACKHEIAB \\"oi\\" tcp_expand set tcp.custom.toggle_expand_track folderdepth>0 [49, 49, 70, 70] [195 3 26 26] how do i set it so the higher the folderdepth the higher the x coordinate","output":"WALTER (Window Arrange Logic Template Engine) for REAPER theming does not directly support dynamic calculations within its syntax that adjust positioning or size based on another attribute's value, such as increasing an element’s x-coordinate based on the \`folderdepth\`. The WALTER code snippet you've provided is a static definition, meaning it sets the \`tcp.custom.toggle_expand_track\` button to have a fixed position and size within the Track Control Panel (TCP), but it does not inherently allow for dynamic adjustment based on the folder depth. Given the limitations of WALTER for dynamic positioning based on attributes like \`folderdepth\`, achieving this would require a more creative or indirect approach. Here are a couple of suggestions, though bear in mind they come with their own set of limitations and may not fully realize the dynamic behavior you envision within the confines of current WALTER capabilities: # 1. Using Different Layouts for Different Folder Depths While you can't dynamically calculate positions in WALTER based on \`folderdepth\`, you could potentially create multiple \`tcp_layouts\` that are manually designed for different anticipated folder depths. Each layout could have the \`tcp.custom.toggle_expand_track\` positioned at different x coordinates that you choose in advance. You'd switch to the appropriate layout manually, or through scripting outside of WALTER, based on the folder depth. This method is manual and not automatically dynamic. # 2. Utilize REAPER’s Scripting Capabilities For truly dynamic behavior based on properties like folder depth, consider using REAPER's scripting capabilities (with languages such as Lua, EEL, or Python). A script could monitor selected tracks or all tracks, calculate their \`folderdepth\`, and then perform actions based on those calculations, such as moving UI elements or triggering layout changes. While a script can't dynamically change WALTER-defined positions, it could, for instance, toggle between layouts or trigger actions that are indirectly related to the folder depth. Here's a rough concept of how a script might approach this: - Monitor track selection or changes. - Calculate the \`folderdepth\` of each track. - Based on the \`folderdepth\`, trigger specific actions or toggle between predefined states/layouts that you set up to correspond with certain depths. # Key Limitation The main limitation is that scripts can't directly modify WALTER theme definitions in real-time or dynamically adjust UI elements defined in \`rtconfig.txt\` on the fly. Scripts could potentially control which of several pre-defined theme variations is applied, but this requires manual pre-configuration and isn't as seamless as what you're envisioning. # Conclusion Directly implementing dynamic positioning in TCP based on folder depth requires functionality beyond what WALTER currently offers. While REAPER is highly flexible and customizable, some specific dynamic behaviors, especially those involving real-time calculations influencing theme element positions, necessitate outside-the-box solutions combining theme design with external scripts. For updates or new features, keep an eye on official REAPER updates and the community forums, as new capabilities and workarounds are regularly developed by the community."},{"instruction":"; ; Reapertips Theme ;

This behavior is built into how REAPER and its theming engine handle track display properties. Your custom button does not automatically adjust position with folder depth because custom elements defined in WALTER do not implicitly support dynamic positioning based on properties like folder depth. Custom element positions are typically defined with static coordinates or sizes, without built-in logic for automatic adjustment based on track properties or changes in track status. To achieve a similar dynamic behavior for a custom button based on folder depth or other properties, you would need to implement additional logic, possibly through scripting (using REAPER's scripting API with languages like Lua or EEL), to adjust the button's position dynamically. However, this approach is outside the direct capabilities provided by WALTER for theme editing and requires a more manual or scripted solution."},{"instruction":"can't i make the custom button have the same behavior?","output":"To have a custom button in the Track Control Panel (TCP) of Reaper adjust its position dynamically based on a track's folder depth (or any other dynamic property) using solely the theme engine (WALTER) is not directly supported. WALTER primarily deals with static layouts defined within theme files (\`ReaperThemeZip\` or \`rtconfig.txt\`), and while it offers great flexibility in designing these layouts, it doesn't directly support dynamic interaction based on changing track properties like folder depth. However, you could approach the problem from a few angles, although each comes with significant limitations or requires combining different parts of REAPER's extensibility: # Scripting to Augment WALTER Theme Behavior: 1. **Lua or EEL Scripting**: Use REAPER's scripting capabilities to write a script that monitors track properties (e.g., folder depth changes) and then adjusts track layout or element properties accordingly. This could involve moving a custom-drawn element using the script or toggling between different track layouts predefined in the theme to simulate the dynamic position based on folder depth. - However, scripts can't directly modify WALTER theme definitions or TCP layouts in real-time; they can trigger actions or switch between pre-made layouts that must be defined in advance within the theme. - You could create multiple track layouts for various folder depths within your theme and use a script to switch between these layouts as the folder depth changes. # Advanced Theme Editing and Conceptual Workarounds: 2. **Multiple Layouts in Theme**: Create different layouts for tracks within your theme (\`ReaperThemeZip\`) that mimic the dynamic behavior you desire. Each layout would correspond to a specific folder depth or range of depths. - This approach is static and wouldn't adjust in real-time based on folder depth changes but could be coupled with scripting to switch layouts based on folder depth. 3. **External Control Surfaces or MIDI Feedback**: In a highly customized setup, you could use external tools or devices communicating with REAPER (through OSC or MIDI) to trigger changes in track layout or visual presentation, including moving elements like buttons. This would be an indirect method and far from straightforward, involving significant setup outside of REAPER's standard workflow. # Conclusion Directly making a custom button in the TCP have its position dynamically adjust based on folder depth, mirroring how track labels adjust, isn't achievable solely through editing the theme or using WALTER. It generally requires supplemental scripting or outside-the-box solutions that combine the available tools in REAPER's ecosystem. The most practical approach, if staying within REAPER's environment, would involve scripting to switch between predefined track layouts based on folder depth, though this still won't offer real-time dynamic positioning as per native elements like track names."},{"instruction":"Привет, написал символ & как текст внутри тега, CS Code HTMLHINT ругается, выдаёт это: Special characters must be escaped : [ & ].(spec-char-escape) Как исправить?","output":"Привет!

The ancient city, first mentioned by the Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogues Timaeus and Critias, is said to have been a highly advanced civilization that mysteriously disappeared under the sea in a single day and night. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful, technologically advanced society located beyond the \\"Pillars of Hercules,\\" believed to be in the Atlantic Ocean. The city was said to have been an economic and military superpower, with incredible wealth, beautiful architecture, and sophisticated infrastructure. However, due to their arrogance and corruption, the gods punished Atlantis, causing it to sink beneath the waves. For centuries, researchers, scientists, and explorers have searched for evidence of Atlantis, but no concrete proof has ever been found. Some believe that Atlantis was a myth created by Plato to convey philosophical or moral lessons, while others argue that the city's existence is plausible. One of the most popular theories is that Atlantis was actually located on the island of Santorini, which was destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption around 1600 BCE. The volcanic eruption would have caused a series of earthquakes, tsunamis, and the collapse of the island, leading to its submersion in the sea. Proponents of this theory point to the similarities between Plato's descriptions of Atlantis and the archaeological findings on Santorini, such as advanced hydraulic systems and the presence of a highly developed civilization. Another theory suggests that Atlantis could have been located in the Bahamas, off the coast of Cuba, or even in the waters near Antarctica. Some claim to have discovered underwater structures, such as man-made walls, roads, and buildings, that they believe could be remnants of the lost city. However, these claims remain controversial and have not been confirmed by mainstream archaeologists. Despite the lack of concrete evidence, the allure of Atlantis continues to capture the imagination of the public. The story of a once-great civilization that vanished in a cataclysmic event serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of human hubris and environmental destruction. Whether Atlantis was a real place or a figment of Plato's imagination, the legend of the lost city continues to intrigue and inspire further research and exploration. As technology advances and our understanding of the past evolves, the truth about Atlantis may one day be revealed. Until then, the mystery of the lost city will remain a tantalizing enigma, shrouded in myth and speculation."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],z={key:0},j={key:1};function q(n,e,l,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",L,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
