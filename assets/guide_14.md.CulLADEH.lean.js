(1) The old high school became the Upper School , while the new building became lower school . (2) The new high school became the Upper School , while the old building became the Lower School . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing. They depict completely opposite scenarios in terms of which school is referred to as the \\"Upper School\\" and which one is referred to as the \\"Lower School.\\" In sentence (1), \\"The old high school became the Upper School, while the new building became the lower school,\\" it suggests that the older high school structure was re-designated as the Upper School. This could imply that maybe programming for older or more advanced students (commonly, Upper School refers to grades traditionally covered by high schools, from grade 9 to 12) was transferred to the original building. Meanwhile, the new building is being referred to as the Lower School. Typically, Lower School refers to early education levels such as elementary school (kindergarten to grade 5, or sometimes up to grade 8). Therefore, this suggests that the new building was perhaps created or allocated for younger students or for beginning grades. On the contrary, sentence (2) \\"The new high school became the Upper School, while the old building became the Lower School,\\" suggests an entirely opposite scenario. Here, the newly built high school has been designated as the Upper School, implying that the new building is being used for the high school grades. On the other hand, the old building is being re-purposed as the Lower School, which would indicate that the older or original structure is now being used to house the younger, early education level grades. Both scenarios are quite common when educational institutions grow, shift, or change their infrastructure to better accommodate their programming needs, student population, or the evolving dynamics of their education system. But it's crucial to note that despite both sentences discussing similar changes, they are inversely related regarding their outcomes. The opposite buildings are becoming the Upper and Lower Schools in each sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Sentence:","output":"Ahmet Ertegun was an influential figure in the world of music, particularly in the development and promotion of the rhythm and blues genre. As a genre, rhythm and blues has its stylistic origins in blues music, which was born from the African American community's experiences and struggles. Drawing from these deep roots, rhythm and blues emerged as a distinct genre characterized by its unique beats and powerful, emotive vocals and has since become a vital part of the global music scene. Rhythm and blues resonated with a wide range of audiences and throughout its evolution, it has given birth to many subgenres and derivatives. One notable derivative of rhythm and blues is disco, which became increasingly popular during the 1970s. Disco built on the rhythmic foundations and energy of rhythm and blues, but it added an uptempo beat and a more light-hearted, danceable vibe to the music. In its essence, rhythm and blues is a genre with rich foundations in blues, and it has continued to expand and inspire the creation of a wide variety of musical styles, such as disco.

In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies, there is often, though not always, sexual parity as well.

Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers, who continue living nearby in the same camp.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything. During a rainstorm that evening The Lady faces off with Eugene Dred after Dred rapes a young girl at the saloon. She defeats him... Answer:","output":"In the movie plot, the unnamed gunslinger, The Lady, enters the town of Redemption and becomes involved in a single elimination gunfighting contest organized by the town's ruthless mayor, John Herod.

Premise: A man on a motorcycle rides donuts with a crowd watching Hypothesis: The motorcycle rider is performing tricks. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, because the premise provides us with specific details about the event that supports the hypothesis. The premise states that a man on a motorcycle is riding donuts with a crowd watching. Let's break down the premise to better understand why it supports the hypothesis. 1. \\"A man on a motorcycle rides donuts\\": Riding donuts on a motorcycle is a stunt or trick that involves maneuvering the motorcycle in tight circles, often producing circular patterns on the ground or causing the motorcycle's tires to leave a circular, skid mark. This implies that the motorcycle rider is demonstrating skill, control, and mastery over the motorcycle, which are essential components of performing tricks. 2. \\"With a crowd watching\\": A crowd watching the event signals a display or a performance of some sort. When a crowd gathers to watch a person on a motorcycle, it indicates that there is likely something interesting, difficult, or impressive occurring. People are less likely to gather around to watch mundane activities, and the presence of the crowd suggests that something exciting, such as a motorcycle trick, is taking place. Based on the premise, we can observe that the motorcycle rider is performing a donut, which is a stunt or trick as mentioned earlier. Additionally, the presence of an audience implies that the rider is putting on a show or displaying their skills, which aligns with the hypothesis that the motorcycle rider is performing tricks. Therefore, given the premise, we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is true, as the details provided in the premise support the idea that the motorcyclist is executing tricks."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Possible answers: [I] Your counselor may ask you, \\" how do you feel about our friendship? \\" or \\" how do you see our relationship changing? \\" you should also clarify your perspective so that a counselor understands where you're coming from. For example, \\" my partner is busy with work, and our friendship has become more serious. [II] Be prepared to say a lot about your relationship with this person, but also let him/her know why you want to take the time to discuss your relationship. The answers will work best if you know your counselor on a first come, first served basis. [III] Your counselor will ask about your history as a couple, why you sought treatment, and other questions to see where you are as a couple. Make sure you get everything out on the table about your relationship. [IV] Without being judgmental, consider how effective your sessions might be at removing naysayers.

This helps the counselor to understand your relationship and provide the best guidance. Why other answers are wrong: I. The counselor is unlikely to ask about \\"our friendship\\" or \\"our relationship\\" because they are not part of the relationship. Instead, the counselor will ask about your and your partner's relationship. II. The first come, first served basis is not applicable to couples counseling. Counselors will provide guidance based on the couple's needs, not based on the order in which they met them. IV.

The user is expressing gratitude and the desire to show support but is hindered by their circumstances. 2. Recognize the different parts that contribute to the sentiment: The tweet contains gratitude, positivity, and limitation. The gratitude and positivity can be seen in the thanking of another user and the desire to show support. The limitation arises from the user's current location, which prevents them from fully expressing their support. 3.

Considering that the word \\"useful\\" indicates a positive experience or some level of satisfaction with the product or service, it can be deduced that the review is more likely to lean towards a higher rating than a lower one. However, the lack of specificity and the brevity of the review might not convey strong feelings or a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Thus, it can be reasonably assumed that the ★-rating might not be the highest. Taking these factors into account, the most likely ★-ratings for this review could range from a ★★★☆☆ (3 stars) to ★★★★☆ (4 stars). A ★★★☆☆ (3 stars) rating would suggest that the product/service was indeed useful but may have had some drawbacks or limitations. On the other hand, a ★★★★☆ (4 stars) rating would express that the product/service was useful and provided a good experience, but it may have lacked certain qualities or features that would have made it exceptional, warranting a ★★★★★ (5 stars) rating. In conclusion, without more context or information, it's difficult to accurately determine the exact ★-rating.

Then, we cue to Bonnie Parker's dressing up to leave home in a cheap apartment in Oklahoma City in 1932.Bonnie Parker (Dorothy Provine) works in a cheap dirty bar. This is the only job she could get, because she was married to Duke Jefferson (Richard Bakalyan), who has got one hundred and seventy-five years in jail. Guy Darrow (Jack Hogan) wants to go out with her, in spite of her being married. He goes to see her in the bar she works a night when she feels tired, her feet hurt, and the diner cook (Ken Lynch) is beginning to go off-limits with her. Bonnie throws some hot oil from the frying pan to Guy because he had said she was hot.In spite of everything, Guy will follow her home after work. He insists, so she threatens him by showing off a gun. At that moment, the bar owner arrives, dressed up to the nines. He tries to force Bonnie, so she throws him down the stairs, while Guy keeps himself hidden, listening. Guy tells Bonnie that she would like working as a whore in some seedy street corner if she doesn't leave with him - the hint is that the cook is dead. Guy says this while holding a tommy-gun.Wichita Fall, Texas: Bonnie and Guy wait until it's about closing time to rob a bar. Whey they have taken all the money from the till, they shoot all over the place reducing the bar to debris, although the bar patron himself is not hurt.

Question: What items discussed here briefly have limitations? Context: Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as 850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \\"heads\\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \\"upside down lettering error\\" coins. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins. A:","output":"The items discussed here briefly that have limitations are the error coins and vending machines.

Information:  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Andinichthyidae is a prehistoric family of catfishes from the Cretaceous of South America .  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).

Article: One of the most popular and enduring myths about depression is that depressed people are sad all the time--and that by extension, people who are happy can't be experiencing depression, even if they say they are. It is a mistaken version of depression. Depression doesn't make you sad all the time. When I'm having a depressive feeling, I'm not walking around in black clothes, and weeping. I go out with friends. I play jokes. I keep working, and have friendly chats with the people I work with. I read books. Above all, I experience moments of happiness. Yet I feel a strange conflicting pressure. On the one hand, I feel like I need to engage in a sort of sadness for people to understand that I really am depressed and that each day is a struggle for me. Because that way I will appear suitably sad, and thus, depressed--and then maybe people will recognize that I'm depressed and perhaps they'll even offer support and assistance. On the other hand, I feel an extreme pressure to perform just the opposite, because sad depressed people are boring and no fun, as I am continually reminded every time I speak openly about depression or express feelings of sadness and frustration. I'm caught in a trap where if I don't perform sadness, I'm not really depressed, but if I express sadness at all to any degree, I'm annoying and boring and should stop being so self-centered. Depression can become your master, but you can slip out from under it occasionally. And many depressed people don't actually spend it fainting dramatically on the couch and talking about how miserable they are. Question: When feeling depressed, the writer usually avoids   _  .

The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help.

Under the N.B.A.’s new luxury-tax system, which punishes teams that wildly exceed a determined threshold, that salary could cost the Knicks an additional 35 million to 45 million in tax payments.      Although the Knicks were carefree with their payroll over the last decade, even Madison Square Garden has a limit. This contract might be it.      Photo      A person with knowledge of the Knicks’ deliberations said it was “more likely than not” that the team would decline to match the offer. The same person cautioned, however, that “it’s not definitive.”      Lin played brilliantly for most of February. He electrified the Garden and saved the Knicks’ season. He is a global marketing machine. But 60 million is an extraordinary amount, even in N.B.A. terms, to spend for a player who has started only 25 games.      Knicks officials have been typically silent, and they are under no obligation to tell anyone anything until Tuesday night — the deadline for matching Houston’s offer. It is unlikely there will be any clarity until then. (It is a well-established tradition for N.B.A. teams to wait until the last minute in these matters.)      The Knicks’ intentions appeared to be telegraphed Saturday night, when they unofficially reached a deal to acquire Raymond Felton, a veteran point guard, from Portland. Although Felton could simply be an insurance policy — a hedge against Jason Kidd’s age (39) and Lin’s inexperience — the move was widely interpreted as the first step in cutting ties with Lin.      Lin himself told associates that he believed Felton was acquired to replace him. Yet even Lin is not sure what the Knicks will do, those associates said. He has been told nothing directly by team officials. And no one in the Knicks’ hierarchy is talking, leaving fans to speculate and fret.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Comments like those were common as distraught fans grappled with the news. An online petition calling for the Knicks to keep Lin was already circulating. It had more than 2,000 signees by midnight Sunday.      The decision was never supposed to be this complicated or stressful. Lin is a restricted free agent, which allows the Knicks to match any offer. He has early Bird rights, which give the Knicks greater flexibility to pay him without regard to the salary cap.      Photo      And because of an obscure cap provision, no rival was allowed to offer Lin more than a 5 million starting salary. That provision, commonly known as the Gilbert Arenas rule, was created to ensure that teams could re-sign a breakout star like Lin without fear of being outbid by a team with cap room.      The well-intentioned rule is having unexpected consequences. The Rockets cannot outbid the Knicks, but because they are under the cap, they are permitted to give Lin a balloon payment — a so-called poison pill — in the third year of his deal. Houston originally set that figure at 9.3 million and then increased it to 14.98 million, close to the maximum allowed.      For cap purposes, Lin’s three-year salary would count as an average for Houston, or 8.4 million a year. But the Knicks would be charged the full amount in 2014-15, costing them 50 million to 60 million in a combination of salary and luxury taxes, rival executives said.      That said, Lin would arguably be undervalued in the first two years — at 5 million and 5.4 million — and the Knicks would have time to either rework their payroll or, as a last resort, to trade Lin by the third year, when his expiring contract would become a commodity. Those are considerations the Knicks are still weighing.      Lin’s salary would be the Knicks’ third highest in 2014-15, behind those of Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire. He would make slightly more than Tyson Chandler, the reigning defensive player of the year.      Even for N.B.A. players, who are used to seeing outlandish contracts fly every July, the offer to Lin appeared staggering. Anthony, speaking to reporters covering the United States Olympic team, said as much Sunday.      “It’s not up to me,” he said. “It’s up to the organization to say that they want to match that ridiculous contract.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The salary may indeed be ridiculous.

Lights flickered in nearby homes when Kidd demolished the pole, and neighbors lost cable and Internet service for about 12 hours.            “He did a lot of damage,” said a Cablevision worker dispatched to the neighborhood.            Ricky Soares, 55, who lives nearby said he was throwing a party when the accident happened.            “That’s when the lights went out for a second and then came back on ... the TV was out. The Cablevision was out,” Soares said.            “It was a nuisance,” added neighbor Bob Lax, 76. “Cable, telephone and everything else went out. I went to use to the phone; it was dead.”            Donna Engelson, a grandmother, scolded Kidd, a father of six, for being irresponsible.            “Just because he’s Jason Kidd doesn’t mean he can drive drunk and cause a lot of property damage that we may have to pay for,” Engelson said. “He inconvenienced a lot of people.”            It’s not the first time Kidd has been on the wrong side of the law. He pleaded guilty in 2001 to a domestic violence charge stemming from an incident involving his ex-wife, Joumana.            He led the New Jersey Nets to NBA Finals appearances in 2002 and 2003 before winning a title with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011.            As a member of the Knicks, Kidd was expected to mentor fellow point guard Jeremy Lin, who now appears to be headed to the Houston Rockets after signing a 25 million offer sheet that the Knicks appear unlikely to match.      Lin burst on the scene last season, captivating Madison Square Garden and sparking a phenomenon coined \\"Linsanity\\" as the Knicks enjoyed a long winning streak in the absence of All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony. He started 25 games before hurting his knee, which caused him to miss the playoffs.            The Knicks had no immediate comment on Kidd’s arrest.            But Knicks fans said the incident should spur the team’s brass to rethink resigning Lin, a devout Christian, before it’s too late.            “Letting Lin get away is a bad idea,” said Cristy Cobb, 23, of Brooklyn.

Christianity: Within the Christian tradition, especially in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, canon law refers to the set of ecclesiastical laws, regulations, and legal principles created and enforced by the Church's hierarchical authorities for the governance of both the clergy and the laity. Canon law governs various aspects of church life, such as the administration of sacraments, the selection of church leaders, establishment and governance of religious institutions, and the conduct of clergy and faithful members. In Protestant denominations, although there might be a similar concept like \\"church order\\" or \\"church law,\\" it does not follow the same structure and prominence as in the Catholic and Orthodox churches. 2. Judaism: In the Jewish tradition, canon law pertains more to the interpretation and application of religious law, otherwise known as Halakha. Halakha is derived from the written Torah, the oral Torah (Talmud), and rabbinic legal decisions. Similar to Christian canon law, Halakha covers various aspects of Jewish religious life, including dietary laws, prayer, Sabbath observance, and marital and family law. The interpretation and application of Halakha are overseen by Rabbis and scholars who have dedicated their lives to understanding and preserving Jewish religious law. 3. Islam: Islamic law, known as Sharia, functions as a kind of canon law in the Islamic tradition. Sharia is derived from the Quran, the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad), and the consensus of Muslim scholars (Ijma) and analogical reasoning (Qiyas). Sharia encompasses various facets of Islamic life, including religious rites, family law, business, and finance. Sharia is regarded as the divine law of Allah and is intended to guide and regulate the behavior of all Muslims. Sharia is interpreted and applied by religious scholars and jurists, and its implementation varies significantly between different Islamic societies and countries, depending on the prevailing legal system, customs, and cultural context. In conclusion, canon laws are applicable in religious traditions that have an organized system of governance, legal principles, and the need for regulatory mechanisms to maintain order and discipline within the community. The concept and application of canon law vary across Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, but the basic premise of regulating religious life and providing guidelines for the behavior of the faithful remains consistent across these traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem: triathlete dan runs along a 4 - mile stretch of river and then swims back along the same route . if dan runs at a rate of 10 miles per hour and swims at a rate of 6 miles per hour , what is his average rate for the entire trip in miles per minute ? Output:","output":"Let's break down the problem: Dan runs 4 miles at a rate of 10 miles per hour and swims back 4 miles at a rate of 6 miles per hour. We want to calculate his average speed for the entire trip in miles per minute. First, let's find the time it takes for each part of the journey. Time to run = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 10 miles per hour = 0.4 hours. Time to swim = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 6 miles per hour = 0.6667 hours. Now let's convert these times to minutes: Time to run = 0.4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 24 minutes Time to swim = 0.6667 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 40 minutes. Total time for the entire trip = Time to run + Time to swim = 24 minutes + 40 minutes = 64 minutes. The total distance Dan traveled is 4 miles (running) + 4 miles (swimming) = 8 miles.

Here are possible answers to this question: - windowsill - sea - disneyland - curtain - street  I believe the correct choice is \\"windowsill\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"windowsill\\". Windowsills are the edges of the spaces in a property's walls where windows are installed. The windows themselves are made of transparent materials, typically glass. This transparency allows light from outdoors to enter the building, brightening the room. By extension, this also means that sunshine, which is nothing but natural light from the sun, can enter a house through its windows. If it's a sunny day, you'll see that the area by your windows, including the windowsill, gets lit up. Simply put, a windowsill is a pathway for light, and in this context, sunshine, to permeate a room. The other options provided seem less plausible. \\"Disneyland\\" and \\"street\\" are clearly irrelevant to the question since these are outside locations that have no direct relation to sunshine entering your house. Disneyland is an amusement park, and the street is an outdoor public road. Apart from the occasional streetlight's glow that may creep in through your windows during the night, there's no connection with how sunshine comes into your house. The \\"sea\\" answer could be indirectly related to sunshine entering your house if your house is located near it and reflects sunlight into your windows. However, it's not the sea itself that allows sunlight into your house; it's the windows that play the core role. Therefore, it's not the appropriate answer. Finally, the \\"curtain\\" choice is somewhat related to windows as it's typically a piece of cloth used to cover windows. While curtains indirectly influence the amount of sunlight that enters a house by controlling how much of the window is exposed or covered, they do not allow light to enter the house. When a curtain is drawn, it often blocks or dims light. Thus, they don't let sunshine in; rather they're used to filter or block it out.  Therefore, based on the analysis of all the given options, \\"windowsill\\" is indeed the correct answer, because it is directly linked to allowing sunlight into your house."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Convert a disfluent question to a proper question.

Percentage of students who got first division = 29% 3. Percentage of students who got second division = 54% 4. Percentage of students who just passed = ? 5. No student failed. Now we are supposed to find the percentage of students who just passed. We know that the total percentage will always be 100%. So, let's add the percentages of first and second division students and subtract it from 100% to get the percentage of students who just passed. Percentage of students who just passed = 100% - (29% + 54%) Percentage of students who just passed = 100% - 83% = 17%. Now that we have the percentage of the students who just passed, we can find the number of students who just passed by multiplying the percentage with the total number of students. Number of students who just passed = 17% * 300 To calculate the percentage of a number, we can simply divide the percentage by 100 and multiply it by the number.

It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc. He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.  - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.  - Eugene Peyton Jarvis (born 1955) is an American game designer and programmer, known for producing pinball machines for Atari and video games for Williams Electronics. Most notable amongst his works are the seminal arcade video games \\"Defender\\" and \\"\\" in the early 1980s, and the \\"Cruis'n\\" series of driving games for Midway Games in the 1990s. He co-founded Vid Kidz in the early 1980s and currently leads his own development studio, Raw Thrills Inc. In 2008 Eugene Jarvis was named the first Game Designer in Residence by DePaul University's Game Development program. His family owns the Jarvis Wines company in Napa, CA  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - The West Coast Computer Faire was an annual computer industry conference and exposition most often associated with San Francisco, its first and most frequent venue. The first fair was held in 1977 and was organized by Jim Warren and Bob Reiling. At the time, it was the biggest computer show in the world, intended to popularize the personal computer in the home. The West Coast PC Faire was formed to provide a more specialized show. However, Apple stopped exhibiting at the West Coast Computer Faire, refusing to exhibit at any show other than COMDEX that also had PC-based exhibits. In 1983, Warren sold the rights to the Faire for US3 million to Prentice Hall, who later sold it to Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Interface Group and COMDEX. In total, sixteen shows were held, with the last in 1991. After Warren sold the show, it had a few more good years, and then declined rapidly.  - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - Smash TV is a 1990 arcade game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams. It is a dual-stick shooter in the same vein as its predecessor, \\"\\" (also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves of enemies by using guns. The plot of \\"Smash TV\\" revolves around a futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes as well as their lives.  - The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993. The Apple II marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market  branded towards American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists.   - Total Carnage is multi-directional arcade shooter released by Midway in 1992. Ports were released for the Super NES in 1993 and Amiga CD32, Amiga, and MS-DOS in 1994. It shares many gameplay elements with Midway's previous title \\"Smash TV\\", including two-player simultaneous play, and adds scrolling, large enemy vehicles, the ability to collect and place (using a dedicated button) bombs, and a much wider range of gameplay scenarios.  - Sneakers is a fixed shooter for the Apple II , created by Mark Turmell and published by Sirius Software in 1981 . It 's Turmell 's first published game ; he later worked on Smash TV , Total Carnage , and NBA Jam .  - A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.  - The Apple IIe (styled as Apple //e) is the third model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The \\"e\\" in the name stands for \\"enhanced\\", referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were available only as upgrades or add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes.  - Sirius Software was a video game publisher of Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64 and Commodore VIC-20 computer games in the early 1980s. Sirius also developed games for the Atari 2600 which were published by 20th Century Fox Video Games.    What is the relationship between 'sneakers ' and 'apple ii series'? Answer:","output":"\\"Sneakers\\" is a fixed shooter game created by Mark Turmell and published by Sirius Software in 1981 for the Apple II series. The Apple II series is a line of 8-bit home computers developed by Apple Computer. So, the relationship between \\"Sneakers\\" and \\"Apple II series\\" is that Sneakers is a game specifically developed and designed to be played on the Apple II series computers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Chaos Theory Context: Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds) is a professional speaker who lectures on time management and he lives by example by perfectly maximizing his efficiency through scheduling and planning his own life down to the minute. One day when his wife Susan (Emily Mortimer) decides to set the alarm clock back 10 minutes, in hopes of giving her husband an extra ten minutes of time in the morning; she accomplishes the exact opposite. From missing the ferry to arriving late to his lecture on time management, Frank experiences an off day. While driving home, he sees a pregnant woman in need of help of getting to the hospital and he decides to offer the stranger a lift. At the hospital, Frank is asked to fill out some paper work, and not thinking much about his situation, he puts his own information down and the nurses at the hospital misunderstand and assume he is the father.The following morning, before Frank arrives home, a nurse from the hospital calls attempting to reach him and his wife answers the phone. The nurse, in trying to contact who she thought was the father, leads Susan to believe it is Frank's baby and she presupposes he is cheating on her and leading a double life. When Frank arrives home, he is unable to clear up the misunderstanding and Susan throws him out of the house. Susan then refuses to speak to him, and only allows him to see his daughter after school. In an attempt to prove his honesty to his wife by demonstrating that it is not his baby, Frank sees a doctor and receives the news that he was never able to reproduce to begin with, since he has Klinefelter's syndrome.A few days later, the stranger brings her baby to the Allens' house in hopes of thanking him for his kindness, only to find his wife at home. After the stranger introduces herself and her baby to Susan, she clears up the misunderstanding, but the damage is done since Frank now knows that their child is not really his. The tides change dramatically as Frank realizes that he was the one in the relationship who was faithful, and goes through a...","output":"...series of emotions, trying to understand the implications of the recent revelations. Once Frank learns he has Klinefelter's syndrome, he delves deeper into understanding the condition and its impact on his life. Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males, typically resulting from an extra X chromosome. Males affected by this syndrome may have certain physical, learning, and reproductive characteristics, which may include infertility, gynecomastia, and mild learning disabilities. As Frank researches more about Klinefelter's syndrome, he learns that the common symptoms include reduced muscle mass, less facial and body hair, and a higher likelihood of developing osteoporosis. In addition to infertility, affected males may experience low testosterone levels, which can lead to fatigue, lower sex drive, and difficulty concentrating. Frank also finds out that Klinefelter's syndrome is usually not inherited, which means that it was not passed down to him from his parents and it is also not something he could have passed on to his child - although that point is moot since Frank learns he cannot father children due to the syndrome. This lack of inheritance further cements the fact that their daughter, despite not being biologically his, did not inherit the condition from him. Understanding the implications of Klinefelter's syndrome also makes Frank question his relationship with Susan. The news that he was not the biological father of their daughter means Susan must have had an extra-marital affair at the time of conception. Frank experiences a whirlwind of emotions, from betrayal and anger to sadness and disappointment. He must grapple with the knowledge that his entire family life was built on a secret he was not privy to until now. As Frank attempts to deal with the emotional fallout of his Klinefelter's syndrome diagnosis, he now also needs to reassess his life, his relationships, and his plans for the future. The once tightly scheduled and meticulously planned life Frank led has now been thrown into chaos. The revelation of his condition forces Frank to reflect on his priorities, values, and the true meaning of love and family. In the end, Frank is faced with a decision to either confront Susan about her infidelity and the fact that their daughter is not biologically his or to accept the situation and continue to love and care for his family despite the tumultuous circumstances. As the story unfolds, Frank and Susan must navigate the complexities of their relationship, the truth, and the consequences that come from a life carefully planned and thrown into disarray by a series of unexpected events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who wrote the novel Saturday Night, Sunday Morning?","output":"Alan Sillitoe wrote the novel \\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.\\" It was first published in 1958 and is one of his best-known works. Born on March 4, 1928, in Nottingham, England, Sillitoe grew up in a working-class family and drew on his own experiences and observations of life in a post-World War II industrial town to write this powerful novel. \\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\\" tells the story of Arthur Seaton, a young factory worker, who spends his weekends enjoying alcohol, partying, and engaging in illicit relationships, all while rejecting societal norms and values. The novel explores themes of class, individualism, and rebellion against the backdrop of a changing Britain. The story is set in the Midlands of England and paints a vivid picture of the grueling life of the working class in post-war industrial towns. Sillitoe was part of the \\"Angry Young Men\\" movement, a group of writers in the 1950s and 60s who were disillusioned with the promises of post-war British society and often explored issues of class, social injustice, and hardship in their works. Other authors associated with this movement include Kingsley Amis, John Osborne, and John Wain. \\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\\" was a critical success upon its publication and helped establish Sillitoe as an important voice in British literature. The novel was later adapted into a successful film in 1960, directed by Karel Reisz and starring Albert Finney as Arthur Seaton. Throughout his career, Alan Sillitoe authored numerous novels, short stories, plays, poetry collections, and even screenplays. Some of his other notable works include \\"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\\" (1959), a collection of short stories that deal with similar themes of working-class life and disillusionment, and \\"Key to the Door\\" (1961), a novel set in the British Army. Alan Sillitoe passed away on April 25, 2010, but his powerful, unapologetic portrayal of working-class struggles and the harsh realities of post-war British life continue to resonate with readers today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Q: What kind of solution might cause animal cells to burst?    Choices:  - Acid Solution  - monatomic  - eutrophic  - hypotonic  A: Answer:","output":"A: Hypotonic Step 1: Understanding the question The question asks about a solution that may cause animal cells to burst. This implies that we need to find a type of solution that would cause an influx of water into the cells, potentially causing them to burst due to the increased pressure. Step 2: Analyzing the choices - Acid Solution: Refers to a solution with a pH lower than 7. This may affect the cell's function, but it doesn't necessarily lead to the cell bursting. - Monatomic: Refers to a substance consisting of single atoms, which doesn't directly relate to the question of animal cells bursting. - Eutrophic: Refers to water bodies rich in nutrients that often cause excessive algae growth. This choice doesn't directly relate to causing animal cells to burst. - Hypotonic: Refers to a solution with a lower solute concentration than inside the cell. This causes water to move into the cell in an attempt to balance the concentration, potentially leading to the cell bursting. Step 3: Choosing the correct answer Based on the analysis, a hypotonic solution is the most likely to cause animal cells to burst, as it leads to an influx of water into the cells in an attempt to equalize solute concentrations, which can cause the cells to burst due to increased pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mega-Merger Fever Not long ago in Innovators Insight, we argued that mega-mergers in the telecom industry were likely to prove disappointing. Here, we examine how our analysis has held up. Merger fever continues to course through the global economy as companies with ample cash use acquisitions to satiate the growth desires of hungry investors. Even Cisco Systems , a company famous for focusing on small acquisitions, has expanded its merger efforts. In 2005, Cisco purchased video network equipment provider Scientific-Atlanta for 6.9 billion. This year, it purchased Web conferencing provider WebEx for 3.2 billion. One of the mergers described in last years Insight proves a cautionary tale for future mega-mergers. In April 2006, French communications equipment provider Alcatel announced plans to merge with Lucent creating Alcatel-Lucent , a giant with annual revenues of more than 25 billion and close to 90,000 employees. At the time, Patricia Russo, the CEO of the combined Alcatel-Lucent, said: “This presents extraordinary opportunities for our combined company to accelerate its growth. The combination creates a new industry competitor with the most comprehensive portfolio that will be poised to deliver significant benefits to customers, shareowners and employees.” Over the last year, Alcatel-Lucents stock price has sagged; it has had to deal with an employee march in Paris protesting job cuts; and in February it reported an 800 million fourth-quarter loss. This is probably not what Russo had in mind. Boston Scientific‘s well-publicized struggles to swallow Guidant are another cautionary example of how mega-mergers can be a huge distraction. Generally, companies facing disruptive threats should be cautious of undertaking a mega-merger. The inevitable distractions can divert attention when it is most needed. The other mega-merger described in last years Insight was the reconstitution of AT&T as a powerful telecom service provider. In March 2006, AT&T (itself purchased by SBC Communications in 2005) announced plans to swallow up BellSouth for 67 billion. The company doesnt seem to have stumbled over the same issues as Alcatel-Lucent: In the last year, AT&Ts stock has been rising. The company expects nearly 8 billion in cost savings over the next three years and plans to pour that money into innovation, such as its foray into television. Moving into television is unlikely to be sufficient for AT&T to weather the disruptive storms raging in the rapidly converging communications and media industries. And the companys mammoth size raises concerns about its ability to create booming new growth offerings. Why might size impair growth efforts? Large shadows can obscure high-potential opportunities. Its just hard to support small-starting growth efforts when revenues reach the tens of billions. An executive could easily dismiss a business that offers 220,000 in first year revenue. Of course, Google‘s first-year revenues were 220,000. Many great growth stories have similarly humble beginnings, but massive companies can struggle to prioritize the small beginnings that translate to blockbuster endings. Generally, the disruptive models suggest that companies generate greater returns from acquisitions if they systematically scan for small companies following disruptive strategies. A company can snatch the disruptor up at a reasonable price before the market fully realizes the disruptive potential. Electronics retailer Best Buy successfully followed this approach when it acquired tech service provider Geek Squad in 2002. Geek Squad provides an affordable way for consumers to access information technology experts in their home. Best Buy paid roughly 3 million to purchase the company. Analysts estimate that Geek Squad produced close to 1 billion in revenues and 280 million in operating profits in Best Buys recently completed fiscal year. Similarly, drug store retailer CVS purchased MinuteClinic–long a Strategy & Innovation favorite–for 170 million last year. Alcatel-Lucent has struggled, AT&T has surged, but in the long run our assessment is that both mega-mergers will end up being disappointments unless AT&T finds ways to give growth efforts sufficient space.

The options are - company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work. Eschach (Neckar) -  Eschach is a river of Baden-Württemberg Germany. Answer:","output":"The appropriate category for the given text, \\"Eschach (Neckar) - Eschach is a river of Baden-Württemberg Germany,\\" would be \\"natural place.\\"  The reasoning behind this selection is that the text describes a geographical feature, a river - Eschach, situated in the region of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Rivers are part of the Earth's natural landscape and are formed by the continuous flow of water from higher to lower terrain. As they constitute key aspects of our environment, rivers provide habitats for diverse ecosystems, often traversing multiple countries and regions, shaping the landscape, and contributing to the well-being of human and wildlife populations relying on them for their sustenance and survival. In this context, Eschach (Neckar) is a crucial component of the natural landscape in Germany, and hence, the fitting category for this text would be \\"natural place.\\" Other options like company, educational institution, or written work, amongst others, do not describe its essence as a river and its contributions to the surrounding environment."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English. هر جا ميرفتم .","output":"To come up with an appropriate translation for the given Persian sentence, it is crucial to understand the individual words and their meanings, as well as the overall grammatical structure of that sentence. Firstly, let us break down the sentence into its separate words and analyze their meanings: 1. هر: in English, this means \\"every\\", \\"each\\" or \\"any\\". 2. جا: this translates to \\"place\\" or \\"location\\" in English. 3. میرفتم: The verb is \\"رفتن\\" (to go), and \\"میرفتم\\" is the past continuous form of \\"رفتن\\" in the first person singular, which translates to \\"I was going\\" or \\"I used to go\\". Now that we understand the meanings of individual words, let's construct the English translation by combining them coherently. Taking into account the grammatical structure and the context, the most accurate translation would be: \\"Wherever I went.\\" Thus, by examining the definition and meanings of the words and understanding the structure, we were able to come up with an English translation for the given Persian sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: NOTE: We've posted the entire volume of 24,199 emails that Sarah Palin sent or received as governor in a series of large, downloadable files you can read here. The New York Times and msnbc.com have also made the emails available on their websites.      The state released the emails today as printed pages. The records begin when Palin took office in December 2006 and run through the fall of 2008, when she was a candidate for vice president (and media organizations requested them).      We've posted a who's who in the emails and want to hear what you're finding interesting. Email us at emails@adn.com with the details.      Daily News reporters reviewed a sampling of the emails throughout the day. Our notes:      Sarah, it's Lance      From Kyle Hopkins in Anchorage, 11:30 a.m., Saturday --      From: Lance Mackey      Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2008 7:59 PM      To: Governor Sarah Palin      Subject: RE: Other      Iditarod is closing in and still wondering if you are interested in riding my 2nd sled out of Anchorage?      The other option is an Iditarider which rides in the sled but is chosen by the highest bidder.all proceeds go to Iditarod. Please let us know ASAP and we can get into specifics or I can choose some one other than yourself If you are unable.      Lance      From: Governor Sarah Palin (GOV sponsored)      Sent: Friday, January 11, 2008 6:11 AM      To: Lance Mackey      Subject: RE: Other      Thank you for writing to Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. The concerns, opinions, and/or information you have sent are important and valuable to the Governor. Although she is unable to respond to each and every email herself, your message has been received and is being reviewed by the appropriate staff person in this office who can best address your need, suggestion, or comment.      \\"Play Tina Fey\\"      From Kyle Hopkins in Anchorage, 6:45 p.m. --      Pat Galvin to Palin on Sept. 16: Subject: \\"Tina Fey.\\"      \\"My suggestion is you offer to go on SNL and play Tina Fey, and you interview her as she plays you,\\" Galvin says. This advice seems unsolicited.      Haters and well-wishers      From Kyle Hopkins in Anchorage, 6:45 p.m. --      I've been going through the very last emails of the bunch, from the fall of 2008. This is post-fame Palin, and the messages reveal a little about what life was like in the governor's office after Palin had become a political rock star.      Haters and well-wishers e-mailed the official governor's account, seemingly in equal measure. Some called for Palin to be shot from a plane like an Alaska wolf. A Juneau woman decried the first dude's increasing role in state government. Others asked Palin to support charity runs or hold fund-raisers in their home states.      -- On Sept. 20, someone claiming to be a Wikipedia editor asked for a high-quality photo of Palin. The governor's office turned him down. \\"Any request that is any way campaign or partisan-related must be directed to the appropriate campaign,\\" wrote communications director Kate Morgan.      -- On Sept. 17, Mike Nizich e-mailed to say that Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, hoped to met Palin the following month in Dallas.      -- On Sept. 15, a woman from Utah writes to say that she's an old aquaintance. Their kids used to go to elementary school together at Iditarod Elementary. Plus, like Track, her son is in the military. The woman's 17-year-old daughter \\"finds herself in the same predicament as Bristol.\\"      \\"I hope you don’t mind if I feel I can (identify) with you in some small way,\\" she writes.      -- On Sept. 15, Pat Galvin writes that the national media have suddenly discovered AGIA \\"and they WANT it to be wrong somehow.\\"      \\"First, the New York Times wrote that the gasline is no sure thing, quoting Bert and Lyda as recent converts against it (\\"We're shocked that TC demands 500 million from the statel\\"), acting as if you had said the gas was practically flowing right now. Recently, we hear that a Newsweek reporter wants to \\"blow the lid\\" oli' the real story that everybody knows we'll never get through Canada, and AGIA was all a ruse to get you to the White House.\\"      \\"Holy cow,\\" Palin replies the next morning. \\"Thank you guys for continuing to get the truth out! And Meg can help.\\"      -- On Sept. 12, Barbara Dewberry of Dallas, Texas, writes that she was visiting Alaska and overheard Jay Ramras talking about Palin at the Snow City Cafe. \\"We said hello and asked if you were in town and that we loved you - wanted you to come to TX. He said you were not      smart and were dangerous.\\"      What's NOT being released      From David Hulen in Anchorage, 1:25 p.m. --      Hundreds of Palin emails are not being released, with various reasons cited by the state. Here are spreadsheets of what were withheld or redacted posted by msnbc.com. It's a big file.      Palin on Don Young: \\"I don't want to get chewed out by him yet again again\\"      From Richard Mauer in Anchorage, 12:20 pm. --      Here's an email that touches on Sarah Palin's difficult relationship with Rep. Don Young and her apparent weakness in dealing with him.      On Sept. 16, 2008, about three weeks after she was selected as John McCain's running mate. Chief of staff Mike Nizich tells Palin that Young wants a call from her. Palin responds: \\"Pls find out what it's about. I don't want to get chewed out by him yet again again, I'm not up for that.\\"      Ghost-writing letter to editor      From Kyle Hopkins in Anchroage, 11:35 a.m. --      In another example Palin’s effort to counter-punch criticism in the media, she ghost-wrote a letter to the editor – quoting herself – that would reply to a complaint that Palin had failed to appear at the 2008 Miss Alaska pageant.      In the July 26th, 2008 note to Frank Bailey, Kris Perry and Rosanne Hughes, Palin drafted a letter to the paper and asks her aides to find someone to send it to the Daily News under his or her name:      Palin writes:      “I’m looking for someone to correct the letter writer’s goofy comments, but don’t want the letter to ADN in response to come from me.”      Palin then provides her aides a draft of the letter:      “Dear Editor: To address Judi Spry’s Anchorage Daily News letter-to the editor on July 26 asking where the governor was during this year’s Miss Alaska Pageant:      First, when I asked Gov. Palin if she was ever Miss Alaska (as Ms. Spry stated), our Governor replied, “Nope, a mere “Miss Congeniality”, one of the runner-up sashes, and much-needed college scholarships were my wins as a participant in that scholarship program, about 100 years ago it seems now.’”      Palin tells her staff she wants the letter to argue that she didn’t blow off the pageant because of a “lack of support” for the event, but in order to keep a commitment to travel to Fairbanks to meet with U.S. Congressmen who were touring ANWR.      Palin aide Ivy Frye replied to the e-mail later that day, suggesting Palin friend Kristan Cole could send the letter.      “Kristan Cole would be perfect as she knows the pageant world but also she knows how busy you and Todd are. I’ll touch base w her today, and Frank too to make sure we’re sending variations and not duplicates of this letter,” Frye wrote.      “Also, we’re rallying the troops re: letters for dps and agia. Phil Schneider’s should run this wkend,” Frye added.      A few days later, on Aug. 2, a letter appeared in the paper attributed to Hughes, Palin's director of \\"external communications.\\" It paraphrased some of the same points that Palin made in her e-mail, but did not include the quote.      Palin on blog commenter: \\"Our security guys should check into her...\\"      From Sean Cockerham in Juneau, 11:10 a.m. --      Palin seemed to be particularly sensitive to the comments posted on the Anchorage Daily News politics blog, at one point asking that her security team check out one of the most critical commentators.      Palin wrote her staff on July 9, 2008 about comments posted on the ADN by Sherry Whitstine of Wasilla.      “I think our security guys should check into her because the times she’s blogged about Todd’s schedule and what we drive have really infringed on our privacy rights and potential safety when psychos know when Todd’s out of town,” she wrote.      Where to read the emails as they're posted      From David Hulen in Anchorage, 10:30 a.m. --      In addition to the links I posted earlier below, msnbc,.com now has a searchable archive of 500+ pages (out of 24,199) up online.      The Washington Post has posted a searchable PDF of roughly the first two months of Palin's governorship - December 2006 through most of February 2007.      Again, we want to hear from you about you're finding interesting as you read through these. Email us at emails@adn.com with the details.      \\"Now. About the blogs...\\"      From Sean Cockerham in Juneau, 10: 20 a.m. –      The emails show Palin and her team obsessive about countering criticism of the governor. One example, from April 24, 2008, is an email from Palin communications director Roseanne Hughes to the top members of the governor’s staff.      “Now. About the blogs. As you know, our boss is getting pounded. Let’s take action. TODAY.      Frank and Ivy, if you could get the word out to your contacts – grassroots supporters who love our boss – we need to get them out there FLOODING that Anchorage Daily News Alaska politics blog. I mean FLOODING.      She then offered ideas of what people could say, including “Quoting Newt Gingrich that Governor Palin is one of the most aggressive reformers in the country.”'      Per diem      From Sean Cockerham in Juneau 10:10 a.m. --      Another email string shows Palin chief of staff Mike Nizich giving Palin advice in how to handle the issue of her taking state per diem for nights she spent in her own home.      This email, sent to a personal account of sp@hslak, was from Sept. 11, 2008, as Palin was running for vice president.      It includes talking points like “State of Alaska rented an apartment in Anchorage for Governor Murkowski” and “Governor Murkowski’s travel in 2006 totaled 525,392.”      It also said that Palin prefers to driver herself, “no chauffeur” and that Palin does not travel with an entourage.      “Just some info we have used to counter comments on the per diem issue,” he wrote to Palin.      Tell us what you're finding in the emails      From David Hulen in Anchorage, 10:05 a.m. --      It looks like the New York Times has a partial easily searchable archive of emails up online now. it covers nine days, with new material being added. The Huffington Post also has some emails posted.      Readers: As you're going through the documents, we want to hear what you're finding interesting or newsworthy. Email us at emails@adn.com with as many specifics as possible.      A list of the emails withheld from release has been scanned and posted by msnbc.com. It's a big pdf.      \\"This is of course ridiculous.\\"      From Sean Cockerham in Juneau, 9:50 a.m. --      I’ve just started going through the 24,199 pages of Sarah Palin’s emails. One, from July 3, 2008, has Palin expressing incredulity that the Daily News is working on a story about the state paying for her daughter, Piper, to come with her to an event in Barrow,      “Huh? Is he writing a story on the First Family’s invitation to attend a native celebration? The state bought one, one-way ticket for only one other member of the First Family (only the return flt,) as not all 7 of us attended of course.      …And we didnt even spend the night so no hotel! And my travel is ¼ what Murk’s was, despite having a large family that’s always invited to all these Alaskan first family events,” Palin wrote her top staffers from her gov.sarah@yahoo.com private email account.      Someone with the email account ftb907@yahoo.com wrote back (might be Palin aide Frank Bailey) Comparing Murki’s travel is key here.      “Also I bet Kris could get Mayor Itta or someone to indicate the desire and/or specific request from the community of Barrow for the whole family This is of course ridiculous. The community of Barrow was elated that you and Piper visited,” the person wrote.      \\"The emails detail a Governor hard at work. Everyone should read them.\\"      Update, 9: 05 a.m.:      This from the Palin camp:      Statement on email release by Tim Crawford, Sarah PAC Treasurer.      \\"The thousands upon thousands of emails released today show a very engaged Governor Sarah Palin being the CEO of her state. The emails detail a Governor hard at work. Everyone should read them.\\"      Released      From Sean Cockerham in Juneau, 9:02 a.m. --      We picked up our set of the documents and are headed to the airport. The whole things seems to be going off without a hitch so far.      Palin emails to be released this morning      Original post:      From Sean Cockerham in Juneau, 7:19 a.m. --      In less than two hours the state will be handing over 24,199 printed pages of emails that Sarah Palin sent or received as governor, a massive trove that has the potential to give insight into how she governed Alaska before vaulting to celebrity.      I’m in Juneau to pick up the boxes of emails being released under public records requests made by more than a dozen media outlets, including the ADN. The document release has attracted intense media attention, with network television crews and reporters from the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and other outlets descending on Juneau to pick up their boxes.      Media organizations are recruiting volunteers from the public to help them sort through the enormous stack of emails, and going to convoluted lengths to figure out how to get them all scanned and posted up on their websites ASAP.      We're inviting readers to share what they're finding newsworthy or interesting (or not) as they read the documents later today. Let us know what you're seeing that's interesting at emails@adn.com      It’s not clear just what all this effort is going to reveal. The emails being released cover from when Palin took office at the end of 2006 until the end of September 2008, the heat of the vice presidential campaign. What they don’t cover are the tumultuous final months of Palin’s term, when she returned to Alaska after the McCain-Palin loss until her abrupt resignation in July 2009.      Other records requests have been filed for those emails, the state isn’t saying when they’ll be released.      The state is withholding more than 2,000 pages of Palin’s 2006-2008 emails, having deemed them private, personal or otherwise exempt from Alaska’s public disclosure law. The state’s lawyers made recommendations for what to withhold and the final decision was made by the governor’s office, which includes holdovers from the Palin administration. A set of the emails to be released was also previously sent for review to Palin’s lawyer, John Tiemessen of Fairbanks. The state says the Palin team made no requests to redact or withhold any of those records.      It’s also questionable if the state even has all of Palin’s emails. Palin did state business using her private yahoo account. The state has sought to retrieve those records, but it’s not clear how many of them remain outside of the public’s view.      But with Palin coming off her East Coast bus tour and flirting with the idea of running for president, the interest is enormous in whatever she had to say. For Alaskans, the release also has the potential of giving insight into how their governor and state government did the public’s work.      Our plan is to get our six boxes of emails as soon as they are released and use a hand truck to bring them to the Juneau airport. I’ll start going through them while waiting for the next flight to Anchorage, scheduled to leave at 12:20 p.m.      I’ll try to blog and post photos of what I see, although I’ll only be able to get a taste of what’s in the emails before we need to check the boxes for the flight to Anchorage. Once in Anchorage, though, the plan is to have a local document firm scan them into electronic form so we can post them for the public on adn.com starting later in the afternoon.      We plan to by Saturday have them up in searchable form, allowing readers to narrow their look at the huge email archive into topics, whether they’re interested in how Palin dealt with the oil companies, or what she had to say about specific issues or people during her time as governor. ||||| Sworn in as      governor.

(Andrew Burton/Getty Images)      Now, three years later, and after much wrangling with the State of Alaska, we’re finally getting 24,199 pages of emails from Sarah Palin’s time as governor. They’re going to be released—on paper—this afternoon.      Before Sarah Palin became a political pundit, reality TV star and household name, she did a whole lot of things in Alaska that raised eyebrows once she became a vice presidential nominee. Reporters began exploring some of those things at the time and filing public records requests to more fully explore her record.      Here's some quick background on the emails and suggestions on what to look for. We’re also going to be updating this post, highlighting interesting nuggets, if any, that people come across.      So… where are these emails from?      The emails are from the beginning of 2007 to September 2008. That covers most—but not all—of Palin’s tenure, which was from December 2006 to when she resigned in mid-2009.      ProPublica filed a public records request for the emails in fall 2008 and teamed up with Mother Jones and msnbc.com when we realized they had done the same. The state ultimately got enough requests that it lumped all of them together, and after many deadline extensions—Alaska state agencies are supposed to get 10 days to fulfill a request, but they can request extensions—it’s releasing the documents today.      Why are they only being released now?      For starters, Sarah Palin didn’t abide by transparency best-practices.      She used a number of private email accounts to conduct state business, complicating the process of sorting out which emails were truly private and which should be a matter of public record. (After the fact, in 2009, the State of Alaska announced a new email policy for executive branch employees: “State business must be conducted through the state email system whenever feasible. In instances where private emails are used, employees must send copies of emails to their state account.”)      Then there was the matter of cost. Alaska at one point quoted prices as high as 15 million for some of the emails. The price for the emails being released today ended up being 725 per news organization.      And, of course, there was lots of lawyering that had to be done, and the state decided to withhold some documents and redact others. According to the state of Alaska, that’s why the emails are now on paper. The state said it didn’t have the technology to redact the emails electronically.      Wait, they’re on paper?      Yes. The emails, which presumably could fit on a few discs, now fit in six boxes and weigh 250 pounds per set. Journalists have trekked to Juneau to pick up them up. (Mother Jones notes that the state is helpfully lending journalists “hand trucks” for hauling the boxes out.)      Alaska’s decision to provide only paper copies has been puzzling. While nothing in the state’s public records law requires the state to provide records in electronic form, public agencies are “encouraged” to “make information available in usable electronic formats to the greatest extent feasible.” Though government agencies have fumbled on redactions in the past, software certainly exists to safely redact electronic data. (We do it all the time.)      Various news agencies have joined the scramble to sift through the documents and restore them to an electronic format. The Anchorage Daily News, ABC News, New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian, Bloomberg News, CNN, CBS, Los Angeles Times and Associated Press have all jumped onboard with varying plans to scan and upload the documents for public consumption.      Also, Mother Jones and msnbc.com have teamed up with us to put up a full searchable archive quickly. (It’s using a service provided free of cost called Crivella West.)      What should we expect to find in them?      We’re not sure. Among the unknowns are how extensive the redactions will be. (Update: Here's a list of them.)      But here are some suggestions on what to look for. You may recall that as governor Palin was involved in a number of controversies that emerged after she was picked as John McCain’s running mate.      In what became known as “Troopergate,” Palin and her husband were accused of personally pressuring a state employee to fire a state trooper who went through an ugly divorce and child-custody battle with her sister. When he refused, he himself was fired. Palin has denied that she pressured anyone. (Here’s the background.) Look for more on this, or on anything she wrote about the Alaska legislature’s investigation into it.      Palin was also caught in a contradiction on a famed “Bridge to Nowhere” construction project. She campaigned for the governorship in favor of it, but as a vice presidential nominee touted her role in killing it. “Thanks, but no thanks” was how she characterized her response to Congress in regard to using federally earmarked funds on the bridge.      The project never really died, either—at least not in its entirety. As we reported at the time, Palin’s administration continued to pursue a road to nowhere—originally intended to be connected to the bridge—with the help of as much as 73 million in federal earmarked funds. Look for whether the emails say anything about that.      The emails also overlap briefly with her time as a Republican vice presidential nominee. Chances are slim, but they could be interesting if there’s information about the presidential campaign or observations to be made about emails sent in the run-up to her selection as McCain’s running mate.      Can I look through the emails too? And how should I share what I find?      Sure. A lot of news organizations are going to be putting bits and pieces of the emails online as the day goes on and even into the weekend.

Question: \\"What was one reason that the rollback policy for unification did not work out\\"  Context: \\"The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"One reason that the rollback policy for unification did not work out was the intervention of Chinese forces in the Korean War. As the UN forces, led by Douglas MacArthur, advanced towards the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the river and launched a series of surprise attacks. These attacks pushed the UN forces back across the 38th Parallel, forcing President Truman to reconsider his initial goal of unification through rollback and instead opt for a containment policy that would split Korea. The Chinese intervention demonstrated the risks associated with attempting to unify the peninsula under a single, non-communist government, and ultimately led to the continued division of the two Koreas at the 38th parallel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Viseu is a city and municipality in the Centro Region of Portugal and the capital of the district of the same name, with a population of 99,274 inhabitants, and center of the Viseu Dão Lafões intermunipical community, with 267,633 inhabitants.  - Politika is a Serbian daily newspaper, published in Belgrade. Founded in 1904 by Vladislav F. Ribnikar, it is the oldest daily newspaper still in circulation in the Balkans and is considered to be Serbia's newspaper of record.  - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - Manuel Maria Ferreira Carrilho ( Portuguese pronunciation : ( mnu mi kiu ) ; b. Viseu , 9 July 1951 ) is a Portuguese philosopher , academic and politician .  - A private military company (PMC) is a private company providing armed combat and/or security services. PMCs refer to their staff as \\"security contractors\\" or \\"private military contractors\\". Private military companies refer to their business generally as the \\"private military industry\\" or \\"The Circuit\\". The United Nations, in a convention so far ratified by 35 states, considers PMCs to be mercenaries and prohibits them; the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and the United States are not signatories to the convention, and the United States has rejected the UN's classification of PMCs as mercenaries.  - Academi is an American private military company founded in 1997 by former Navy SEAL officer Erik Prince as Blackwater., renamed as XE Services in 2009 and now known as Academi since 2011 after the company was acquired by a group of private investors. The company received widespread notoriety in 2007, when a group of its employees killed 17 Iraqi civilians and injured 20 in Nisour Square, Baghdad for which four guards were convicted in a U.S. court.  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

In this sentence, \\"es descubierto\\" means \\"is discovered\\" in English, and \\"el pión neutro\\" refers to the \\"neutral pion\\". The neutral pion is a subatomic particle that plays a significant role in particle physics. It is a type of meson, which is a hadron composed of a quark and an antiquark, and has a neutral charge.  The discovery of the neutral pion was a crucial development in the understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. This interaction is responsible for the binding of protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei, as well as binding quarks within the protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. The neutral pion was first predicted in the late 1940s by Cecil Powell, César Lattes, and Giuseppe Occhialini, who were studying cosmic ray interactions. They discovered the charged pion (π±) in the process and realized that a neutral version (π0) must also exist. The identification of the neutral pion came in the early 1950s, when the notable physicist Murray Gell-Mann proposed its properties and suggested experimental methods to observe it. Neutral pions are unstable and decay primarily into two photons (γ) with a mean lifetime of around 8.4 x 10^-17 seconds. The decay of the neutral pion into photons is an essential process in the study of quantum chromodynamics, as it allows physicists to verify the validity of their theoretical predictions. Overall, the discovery of the neutral pion has significantly advanced the field of particle physics and provided valuable insights into the fundamental forces and particles that govern the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bed and Breakfast (B&B): Bed and breakfasts are small, privately-owned accommodations that primarily provide overnight lodging and breakfast in a cozy, homelike atmosphere. Most B&Bs feature a few guest rooms, each with a bedroom-centric layout that emphasizes the importance of the sleeping area. B&B rooms may also feature en-suite bathrooms, seating areas, and decorative elements that reflect the establishment's unique style and ambiance. B&Bs are popular choices for travelers seeking a more personalized and intimate experience compared to hotels.  4. Lofts: A loft is an open-concept living space, often converted from a commercial or industrial building, where the primary focus is on creating an effective use of space. This type of dwelling offers flexibility in arranging the living and sleeping areas, often featuring a bedroom-centric layout where the bedroom serves as the focal point. Lofts are particularly popular among artists and creative professionals who desire a unique, urban living environment.

The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States.  - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving.  - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college.  - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia . This agency is under Ministry of Education . The PTPTN 's Chairman is Shamsul Anuar Nasarah , member of the Malaysian Parliament for the seat of Lenggong in Perak .  - Postgraduate education, or graduate education in North America, involves learning and studying for academic or professional degrees, academic or professional certificates, academic or professional diplomas, or other qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is required, and it is normally considered to be part of higher education.

Justin stood in front of Benjamin which completely hid them from view behind them since","output":"both boys were quite tall for their age. They were about to embark on what they believed was going to be the adventure of a lifetime. They had discovered an old, tattered map in Justin's grandfather's attic, and were now determined to follow it to its mysterious destination. The attic had long been the source of many wistful tales and lore, stories passed down from generation to generation in the small town where they lived. The boys had heard whispers of treasure, ghosts, and secret passages, always instilling in them the thrill of the unknown. When they had first uncovered the rolled-up parchment, yellowed with age and painstakingly etched with cryptic symbols, they knew they had stumbled upon something special. The winding path on the map led through the dense forest that bordered their town, making its way up to the highest peak and back down into a hidden valley, where a small 'x' marked what they hoped would be a place filled with treasures beyond their wildest dreams. It was this hope, this greedy yearning for ancient riches, that drove the boys to hatch a plan to follow the path in secret. They didn't want to alert their parents or bring others into their exclusive adventure, so they carefully gathered supplies and researched as much as possible about navigation, survival, and wilderness exploration. To keep their quest under wraps, they decided to embark on their journey before dawn, while the rest of the town was still asleep, allowing them ample time to navigate the forest's edge before anyone realized they were gone. That morning, as the sky turned a pale blue and the first hints of the sun began to peek over the horizon, they set out, Justin leading the way with the map firmly in his grip and Benjamin carrying their collective supplies in a backpack. The first part of their journey went smoothly; they followed the trail on the map, always keeping the forest to their right, and in no time at all, they found the first of many markers whispered about in those ancient tales – a gnarled and twisted tree, its limbs intertwined to form an eerily precise circle at the center – just as the map indicated. They continued to trek further, following the path that now led them deeper into the forest. The sunlight filtering through the canopy above dappled their surroundings in a mosaic of light and shadow, the sounds of birdsong and rustling leaves filling their ears. As they traveled, they discovered more markers that matched those on the map: peculiar rock formations, streams that abruptly began or ended, and an assortment of oddly-shaped trees that seemed too strange to have grown naturally. After what felt like an entire day of walking, they found themselves at the base of the mountain peak that loomed in the distance from their small town. The map indicated a challenging climb, leading to a hidden cave entrance high above. With determination in their eyes, the boys began the ascent, their excitement for the treasure propelling them upward. As they climbed, the sun sank lower in the sky, casting golden rays across the mountainside. The winds grew colder with each foot the boys scaled, but they pressed on, driven by the tantalizing mystery of the 'x' on the map. When they finally arrived at the cave entrance, dusk was upon them, and they settled down to rest and recuperate. Ignoring the biting wind and the shadows creeping in from the edges of the cave, they shared the meager provisions they had brought and studied the final stretch of the map. It seemed to indicate that the treasure lay hidden somewhere deep within the mountain, in a chamber accessible only through a labyrinth of tunnels. Gulping down the final, dry bites of their meal, Justin and Benjamin stiffly rose to their feet, steeled their nerves, and stepped into the darkened cavern, the faint beams from their flashlights cutting through the pitch-black void as they ventured into the unknown. As they navigated the winding tunnel system, a growing unease began to settle within them, as though they were being watched. The walls seemed to close in on them, and every so often, they caught movement in the periphery of their vision, an unsettling presence just beyond the reach of their lights. But with each step closer they took, the boys could not help but feel the overpowering allure of the treasure, the promise of wealth and untold secrets that lay just a little further down the path. And it was with this pursuit of knowledge, riches, and fame that Justin and Benjamin descended deeper into the mountain, unaware of the larger forces they had tapped into by unearthing that fateful, ancient map. Little did they know that, beyond the darkness of the labyrinth, a world of magic, forgotten history, and grave danger awaited them. With each step forward, the boys were entwining themselves with a legacy that had been lost to time, and they would soon find themselves facing challenges that would not only test their courage and wit but also reveal the true nature of friendship, loyalty, and the weight of destiny."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - clubs is arbroath cardiff city barry town    - caps is 40 172    - position is defender    - years is 1955 -- 1957 1957 -- 1965 1965 -- ?      - birth date is 4 june 1937    - fullname is alexander soutar milne      - birth place is dundee , scotland    - goals is 0 1    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of person who in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"?, what is it ?

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Here is an article: The denizens of Forbes’ 400 Rich List and Billionaire’s Row would have been ecstatic yesterday when French economist Thomas Piketty, much-heralded author of “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” made his debut at the Kennedy School of Government to a standing room crowd including Harvard faculty members and local investment managers. The entire affair was introduced with splendid reverence by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is bound to be one of the most talked about books of 2014, as it raises to a new crescendo the much-debated and alarming rise in the disparity of wealth not only in the US, but around the globe. It is already the first Harvard University published book to make it to the best-seller list of the New York Times in a very long time. What many will find alarming is Piketty’s prognostication for the ultimate concentration of wealth along 19th century lines: “accumulating that keeps on accumulating,” and assuming a slow growth of the population the “inequality might reach 19th century oligarchic levels.” I suppose that means more and more Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerbergs. Piketty’s research, he claims, suggests that the top of the wealth distribution is growing at a pace three times faster than any other group. He calls the “the return to the patrimonial society,” suggesting that Forbes’ list of billionaires globally is about to become a far larger number of individuals and will be held in even greater powerful positions in their societies than before. The left is going to find this a very scary concept. I await the scathing diatribes against Piketty’s research. However, the economists around me in the crowded Harvard classroom assure me Piketty has collected a mass of statistics comparing the growth of income in relation to the growth of capital, and finds capital expanding at a much greater rate. I thought I heard Piketty allege that the level of taxes is not as salient as the rate of economic growth compared to the accumulation of capital. I guess the simplest way to explain it is that the average rate of stock gains per year over history has been running at 6%-7%, which is about triple the rate of economic growth in the US and Europe right now. So, if you are an entrepreneur with a stock everyone wants to own, your wealth is going to magnify faster than if your holdings expand in line with annual economic growth. Or as Martin Wolf put it in the Financial Times of London: “In normal times capitalists save a sufficiently large share of their returns to ensure that their capital will grow at least as fast as the economy. This is especially likely to be true of the seriously wealthy, who are also likely to enjoy the highest returns. Small fortunes are eaten; big ones are not. The tendency for capital to grow faster than the economy is also more likely when the growth of the economy is relatively slow, either because of demographics or because technical progress is weak.” As we are not seeing moderate rises in wealth, undoubtedly we will be living with immoderate rises in power to the rich. Piketty underscores the predicament of rising inequality. Maybe these new oligarchs had better become subject to ”the far higher marginal tax rates on top incomes and a progressive global wealth tax.” Sounds to me the new oligarchs are going to be emigrating to the low or no wealth tax regimes that will always exist. This debate over Piketty’s books is going to be one of the liveliest intellectual issues of 2014 and beyond. Forbes Magazine ought to be in the forefront of the debate and take a stance on what is most right for the United States economy and democracy.

President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions.

The whole time I was either vacant of thought, or had a fleeting one which screamed \\"TURN IT OFF!!!\\". But I didn't. And actually, I'm glad I did. The animation is stunning. Very artistic, odd and dark. I personally loved it for the amazing animation, but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myself. A young boy--well, cat--goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part she's lying sick in bed, and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper. Her soul is split in half. One is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lost. Then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me, honestly. I expect they go back, and their world is... perhaps slowly falling apart? Maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this, for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world's in. First there's a giant flood, and next it dries up into a bleak desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to either what is God or fate, as you will see). Then I believe they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, totally didn't get that, but it sends shivers down my spine each time.

Solve this instance: Passage: A few months before the D-Day landings during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than Normandy. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson, is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information. This happens quickly and their aeroplane is (unsuccessfully) attacked on leaving Gibraltar.  Question: What is the full name of the character who \\"Jimmy\\" is supposed to impersonate? Student:","output":"Part #1: Write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. Usage: The full name of the character who \\"Jimmy\\" is supposed to impersonate is General Bernard Montgomery. This answer involves references to multiple entities such as \\"Jimmy,\\" \\"actor,\\" and \\"Monty\\" which all relate to the person (M. E. Clifton James) attempting to impersonate General Montgomery. The answer addresses the question unambiguously, identifying the person to be impersonated. Part #2: The answer to the question should be unambiguous. Usage: General Bernard Montgomery is an unambiguous answer as it is taken directly from the paragraph, not leaving room for confusion about the identity of the character in question. It is specific and clear, unlike just saying \\"Monty\\" or \\"the general.\\" Part #3: The answer should be a phrase in the paragraph. Usage: The phrase \\"General Bernard Montgomery\\" is directly taken from the passage, specifically in the sentence that says, \\"Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery.\\" This part of the passage provides the specific name of the character \\"Jimmy\\" is supposed to impersonate. Part #4: Most questions can have only one correct answer. Usage: In this case, there is only one correct answer to the question, which is General Bernard Montgomery. There are no other characters mentioned in the paragraph who \\"Jimmy\\" could impersonate. No other possible answer fits the criteria of the question posed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Article: The measured Afghanistan endgame that President Obama outlined this week suffered new setbacks Thursday, as the Taliban suspended peace talks with the United States and Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded that NATO withdraw forces from the small, rural outposts that are at the heart of its military mission here.      The developments are the latest in a cascade of challenges to the exit that the administration and its coalition partners are planning, including a gradual turnover of security responsibility to Afghan troops, a paced U.S. and NATO withdrawal and a negotiated peace with the Taliban.      Administration officials had steeled themselves for fallout after the burning of Korans by U.S. service members last month and the massacre of 16 Afghan civilians Sunday, allegedly by an Army staff sergeant who went on a rampage.      But Thursday’s statements caught Western officials in Kabul off guard and sparked new concerns that the U.S.-led operation here could unravel as trust erodes between Afghans and their foreign benefactors.      “Afghanistan is ready right now to take all security responsibilities completely,” Karzai said in a statement issued shortly after he met with visiting Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. “To speed up this process, authority should be given to Afghans.”      The statement set no deadline for what it called the “withdrawal of international forces from villages.” It reiterated Karzai’s insistence that foreign troops should not be allowed to conduct night raids on Afghan homes. U.S. commanders rely heavily on these operations to net suspected insurgents.      Karzai has a long history of making demands that the international community ignores or implements slowly, and he has cried wolf many times. But if he presses ahead with the demand for withdrawal of NATO forces from the countryside, the U.S. military could face many of the same challenges it contended with in Iraq in 2009, as Baghdad sought to curb the movement and authority of American troops.      The effect in Afghanistan could be considerably more complex and dangerous. Iraq’s insurgency had begun to wane at the time, but militants in Afghanistan remain strong, despite coalition progress in some areas, and Taliban leaders continue to have sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan.      Coalition commanders see the constellation of small outposts in insurgent-plagued provinces as essential to their goal of providing enough security for the Afghan government to take root. That objective remains elusive in much of the country, and the Afghan government, whose military forces are still a work in progress, still depends almost entirely on foreign funding.      In a news conference in Washington with visiting British Prime Minister David Cameron on Wednesday, Obama acknowledged “multiple challenges along the way” but said that “in terms of pace, I don’t anticipate at this stage that we’re going to be making any sudden additional changes to the plan that we currently have.”      “If we maintain a steady, responsible transition process, which is what we’ve designed, then I am confident that we can put Afghans in a position where they can deal with their own security,” he said.      The plan NATO adopted in late 2010 has already undergone some changes. Although it had indicated that the turnover of security responsibility to the Afghans would not be completed until 2014, with NATO combat forces withdrawing by the end of that year, the alliance now hopes to transition to a supporting role throughout the country by the end of next year.      Karzai’s statement said the transition should be completed in 2013, and it was unclear whether he was proposing a game plan different from NATO’s.      Obama also said that he expected a U.S.-Afghanistan strategic partnership agreement to be completed by the next NATO summit, in Chicago in May. But that agreement, designed to set the terms for a reduced but continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014, has foundered over the issue of night raids.      Karzai has “just generally always been concerned that night raids are intrusive and heavy-handed, whereas what we’ve pointed out is that they’re central to our ability to degrade Taliban operations and battlefield leadership,” said a senior administration official in Washington, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. “We’re trying to find the appropriate course of action.”      Administration officials played down the significance of the Taliban statement suspending peace talks, describing it as part of a roller coaster they have grown familiar with ever since a series of U.S. meetings with the insurgents, most of them in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar, began in late 2010.      But the talks have been stalled for nearly two months, and the new announcement further diminished U.S. hopes that progress could be announced at the NATO meeting as planned.      Late last year, agreement was reached between U.S. officials and Tayeb al-Agha, an aide to Taliban leader Mohammad Omar, on the exchange of five Taliban suspects being held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for a Western official held by the insurgents. The Washington Post has withheld the name of the official for safety reasons, at the administration’s request, since the fall.      Other elements of the tentative deal included what U.S. officials said would be a Taliban statement recognizing the authority of the Afghan government and renouncing international terrorism, and the establishment of a Taliban office in Qatar. But the plan faltered when Karzai objected, saying he had not been consulted. He later suspended ties with Qatar, where Taliban negotiators had established a beachhead.      By January, Karzai reversed course, and U.S. officials said the opening of the Qatar office would also mark the moment when the Afghan government would enter the talks. Congress was briefed on the exchange, under which an initial three Taliban prisoners were to be transferred to house arrest in Qatar, with the other two following 60 days later.      Administration optimism rose when an Afghan government delegation visited the Guantanamo prisoners last week and when Karzai announced Saturday that he would send a senior representative to Qatar for talks with that government. But spirits fell again Sunday at news of the massacre of the Afghan civilians.      In the Thursday statement, posted on its Web site, the Taliban said it was suspending all talks “until the Americans clarify their stance.” It accused the United States of breaking its promise on the prisoner exchange and imposing a new “list of conditions” — an apparent reference to the statement on international terrorism that the insurgents have yet to make.      It also reiterated that Taliban would talk only to the “American invaders” and not to the Karzai government.      “Now they say it’s the Americans who are the problem,” said a second administration official, referring to the announcement. “It was too much to expect that nothing would happen” in the wake of Sunday’s incident, he added.      DeYoung reported from Washington. Staff writer Greg Jaffe in Kabul contributed to this report. ||||| The Afghan Taliban have announced the suspension of all negotiations with the United States, talks that had been seeking an end to the decade-long war in Afghanistan.      \\"The Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend all talks with Americans taking place in Qatar from today onwards until the Americans clarify their stance on the issues concerned and until they show willingness in carrying out their promises instead of wasting time,\\" the armed group said in a statement on Thursday.      The statement said the US had continued to change the terms of the negotiations and had presented a \\"list of conditions\\" in their latest meeting that was in contradiction to earlier arrangements.      Also on Thursday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded foreign troops pull out of villages, another blow to the US military presence in the country.      Karzai's demand came days after a US soldier’s pre-dawn shooting spree in southern Kandahar province left 16 civilians dead.      The soldier, an army staff sergeant, was flown out out of Afghanistan to Kuwait on Wednesday.      \\"Our demand is that this process should be executed sharply and the responsibility should be handed over to Afghans,\\" Karzai said in a statement after meeting with Leon Panetta, the US secretary of defence.      Karzai added that both sides \\"should work towards completing the transition of security responsibilities to Afghan forces in 2013, and not the announced date of 2014\\".      A US defence official told Reuters news agency the US does not believe Karzai is seeking immediate pull out from villages.      \\"There is a schedule for security transition...and President Karzai did not ask for any change in the current schedule (at the meeting),\\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reporters traveling with Panetta.      Oana Lungescu, a NATO spokesperson, said \\"NATO remains committed to enabling the Afghan security forces to take full responsibility for security as soon as practically possible.\\"            'Spiralling downward'      According to reports, the Taliban's pre-condition that five of their high-ranking officials be released from US detention in Guantanamo Bay seems to have halted any progress in peace talks.      Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, said the Taliban had expected the release of the high-ranking prisoners by now and it seems that they have given up on that happening.      \\"I think from the US perspective, you have to see things going from bad to worse in their Afghan policy. All recent events point to a spiralling downward, including the Quran burning incident and then the killings of the 16 villagers, now Karzai is asking the US remove troops.      \\"There is sense that the US [policy] is heading to some sort of disarray at the moment.”      The Taliban announced the opening of a political office in Qatar in January, what was considered a major step in reaching a compromise agreement to end the 10-year war.      Karzai showed little support for the announcement, but eventually endorsed the move.      \\"The Americans initially agreed upon taking practical steps regarding the exchange of prisoners and to not oppose our political office but with the passage of time, they turned their backs on their promises,\\" the Taliban statement said.      \\"An American representative presented a list of conditions in his latest meeting with the Islamic Emirate which were not only unacceptable but also in contradiction with the earlier agreed upon points.\\"      Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington DC, said the situation has certainly raised concerns for US officials.      “One thing the officials will be looking at is whether this is a critical blow to the overall peace process about working a reconciliation deal,\\" she said.      \\"Is this just political posturing on the part of the Taliban, or whether there are deeper problems in the initial stages of confidence building.” ||||| According to a statement from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), four coalition soldiers have died in Afghanistan.      Saturday's deaths, including two soldiers killed in an attack by anti-government fighters in the south, brings the death toll of international troops in Afghanistan to 2,990, since 2001, according to the Reuters news agency.      Those four deaths bring the number of soldiers from the NATO-led forces killed this month to 19.      Though the Reuters news agency reports 2,990 casualties, including 1,959 US forces since the war began in 2001, icasualties.org, an indepdent website that documents casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, including non-combat deaths, puts the total coalition fatalities at 3,002. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The Taliban suspended peace talks with the United States and Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded NATO withdraw forces from rural outposts in Afghanistan, leading to increased concerns for the planned exit strategy.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: If you sit back and think about nice memories you will be able to? Options: - sit quietly - concentrate - wake up - stay focused - relax  Explain why a human would choose \\"relax\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"relax\\" to answer the question above because thinking about nice memories often leads to feelings of comfort, happiness, and contentment. These positive emotions help to counteract stress and anxiety, resulting in an overall sense of relaxation. When one sits back and reflects on pleasant memories, they mentally revisit enjoyable experiences and positive emotions associated with those events. This can help to calm the mind, as it becomes occupied with the feelings of warmth and happiness from those memories. In contrast, other options listed do not necessarily produce the same effect: - Sit quietly: Sitting quietly may not always result in relaxation, especially if one's mind is filled with stressful or distracting thoughts. - Concentrate: Concentrating typically involves focusing one's attention on a task or thought, and while it can be productive, it does not inherently provide the warmth and comfort associated with thinking about nice memories. - Wake up: Waking up does not specifically relate to the act of reflecting on pleasant memories, so it seems unrelated to the goal of relaxation. - Stay focused: Similar to concentration, staying focused requires engaging with a task, thought or activity. While it can be helpful for productivity, it does not imply relaxation or the mental comfort associated with pleasant memories. In summary, the best answer is \\"relax\\" because thinking about nice memories tends to elicit positive emotions and feelings of comfort, which ultimately results in relaxation as the mind and body loosen and unwind."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Created by Glenn Chandler, the show was set in Glasgow, Scotland, and revolved around the exploits of a dedicated team of detectives working to solve murders and other heinous crimes. \\"No Mean City\\" itself is a phrase often used to describe Glasgow, reflecting its gritty and enduring character. The lyrics and music for the theme tune were composed by Mike Moran and Maggie Bell. Mike Moran is a celebrated British keyboard musician, songwriter, and record producer who has worked with prominent musical acts, including Queen and Ozzy Osbourne. To create the theme tune that perfectly fit the tone of the crime series, Moran powerfully fused rock and blues elements into an atmospheric and dark melody, complementing the show's investigative theme. The series \\"Taggart\\" originally featured the character Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Jim Taggart, played by the late actor Mark McManus. Taggart was a tough, no-nonsense Glaswegian detective who was deeply committed to his work and catching criminals. The show continued even after the death of Mark McManus in 1994, and various other lead characters were introduced to keep the captivating spirit of the series alive. Some of these characters included DCI Michael Jardine (played by James MacPherson) and DCI Matt Burke (played by Alex Norton). Over the years, \\"Taggart\\" became known for its memorable catchphrase \\"There's been a murder!\\", often spoken by the lead character.

Write highlights for this article: A mother has warned the medication she takes for her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm – and is now speaking publicly about her experiences of getting it back. U.S. blogger Crista Anne switched antidepressants last year and discovered she was unable to reach climax through masturbation. Experts warn that a delay in the ability to orgasm is a common side-effect of many antidepressants, faced by up to half the people who take them. Crista, a mother-of-three, is now sharing intimate details of her sex life online in order to raise awareness to the side effects of antidepressants. Scroll down for video. U.S. blogger Crista Anne (pictured) has warned the medication she takes to treat her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm. Around half of all antidepressant users experience this effect, an expert has said. Crista has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the years she has tried various treatments including supplements, diets, lifestyle behaviours and the most widely prescribed antidepressants known Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). Last year she switched antidepressants and began taking amitriptyline, an older antidepressant which is no longer used as a first-line treatment. It is thought to block the effects of two chemical messengers called serotonin and norepinephrine, regulating mood and controlling depression. But writing on her blog, Crista says while the medication allows her to 'feel alive for the first time', she began to experience side effects such as sleepiness, a dry mouth and the inability to orgasm. She found ways to cope with the dry mouth and sleepiness, but found the lack of orgasm – or anorgasmia, as it is known medically – a bigger problem. She said on her blog: 'After an IUD [contraceptive coil] installation and starting medications for fibromyalgia and an antidepressant, my orgasm disappeared briefly. 'At the time of recording, with partnered sex I was missing my explosive orgasm. Only experiencing gentle waves. Anorgasmia - the inability to orgasm - is a known side effect of some antidepressants. Crista has blogged about her experiences of anorgasmia, and wants to raise awareness to this side effect. 'While those waves were nice, they were nothing close to the restorative experience I so depend on for a mental, emotional and physical recharge.' ‘A few weeks later I can blissfully report that universe creating powerhouse orgasms have returned via partnered sex. ‘The bad news is that orgasm via masturbation is still gone. Nada. Nil. Nothing.’ She has started a project called #OrgasmQuest, in which she aims to achieve one self-induced orgasm a day, with the hope of regaining her ability to climax through masturbation long term. She tweets updates of whether she has been able to achieve orgasm, to break down stigma. For example:. In her first #OrgasmQuest blog post she describes how being able to orgasm on her own has always helped her battle her depression. She said: 'Masturbating is my zen. It’s my meditation. It’s almost my religion. Masturbation is part of my identity, a part that I am not about to give up on. ‘My high sex drive and orgasmic superpower have been the most dependable parts of my identity. 'Sex has been my go-to pick me up for combating depression, allowing myself to feel something other than the darkness. Until now.' Anorgasmia, or the inability to orgasm, is a common side effect of antidepressants. It is not completely clear why some people experience anorgasmia while taking the drugs. David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, said that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm. He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body. 'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another. 'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. But it also delays time to orgasm.' He explained that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm. 'If you stimulate that serotonin receptor, it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax,' he said. 'There's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation.' However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant. Anorgasmia as a side effect of antidepressants is extremely common, David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, told MailOnline. He said almost half of people who take antidepressants experience this side effect. Globally, more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression, according to WHO figures. In 2011, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  identified about 11 per cent of people took antidepressants - a 400 per cent increase since the 1980s when previous surveys were taken. In the UK, recent government figures revealed more than 50 million prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England last year. A 2013 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found 4 million people in the UK take SSRIs. Crista says she has already tried a wide range of treatments for depression, and does not want to stop taking amitriptyline. Writing on her blog, she said: 'The anorgasmia is not enough to make me want to get off this medication or try another, as I believe that I can work through and return to some sort of orgasmic state. My libido has not been affected.' She wants to raise awareness to this problem as there is a stigma associated with discussing sexuality in public. This means means many people taking antidepressants might suffer in silence, she says. 'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' she told the Daily Dot. 'While my doctor spoke to me in depth about it, the stories I get from hundreds of other people are horrific.' One woman says multiple partners have left her because of her ability to orgasm. Professor Taylor explains that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm. He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body. 'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another. 'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' Crista said. She believes there is a stigma about talking about orgasm in public, which prevents people taking antidepressants getting help. 'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. 'But it also delays time to orgasm.' He added that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm.

However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant. Antidepressants are a type of medication used to treat depression or prevent it recurring. They can also be used to prevent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is thought antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, can improve mood and emotion, although this process is not fully understood. Increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain. Some of the side effects of antidepressants include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm. Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Some include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm. And while antidepressants can help treat the symptoms of depression, they do not always address its causes. This is why they are usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions caused by emotional distress.

When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Problem:Context: Anna Foster (Mandy Moore) is the daughter of the President of the United States, James (Mark Harmon) and First Lady Michelle Foster (Caroline Goodall).When a hassle of Secret Service agents ruins a first date, Anna demands some freedom. Her dad agrees to send only two agents with Anna and Gabrielle La Clare (Beatrice Rosen) to a concert when Anna goes to Prague with her parents. A sexy new look for Anna causes her father to renege. When Anna discovers the concert is filled with agents and that her father has broken his promise, Gabrielle helps Anna elude her protectors. Outside the concert, Anna meets Ben Calder (Matthew Goode), and asks him to drive her to escape the agents. Anna goes to a bar with Ben and proceeds to get drunk. Unbeknownst to Anna, Ben is with the Secret Service, and tells agents Alan Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Cynthia Morales (Annabella Sciorra) where Anna is. The President orders the three agents to have Ben guard Anna without telling her who he really is, to give her an illusion of freedom with a guarantee of safety. Believing herself free of her guards for the first time in years, Anna jumps into the Vltava River naked, mistaking it for the Danube, and Ben has to fish her out (he stays clothed). Weiss and Morales buy the camera from someone taking pictures of the skinny-dipping Anna. Anna and Ben climb a rooftop to watch an opera being shown in a plaza, where Anna eventually falls asleep with Ben guarding her, and Weiss and Morales watching from another roof.The next morning, Anna calls her parents to avoid getting into further trouble with them. Knowing she is safe, her father is initially indulgent, and Anna is about to return, but his tone changes when he is shown the photos of her nude in the river. The First Lady, however, asks, \\"What happened to 'let freedom ring?'\\" (That had been his earlier line when he had decided to let her stay out with Ben.) Anna is outraged at both her dad's sudden imperious tone and finding out that he traced her call. She decides to meet Gabrielle at the Love Parade in Berlin and return to her parents right before the plane trip home. Ben goes with her on the train, where they meet Scotty McGruff (Martin Hancock), a flighty romantic obsessed with Six Million Dollar Man stickers and the interconnectivity of the world, he gives them a stack of stickers and tells them to stick them up in random places, then one day when they are unhappy, they will see one and it will make them smile. Through him, the two learn that they have boarded a Venice-bound train. When they arrive in Venice, Ben calls the other agents to tell them where they are but has to leave the phone dangling when he realizes he can no longer see Anna. He finds her and McGruff getting new clothes, and the three explore Venice - until McGruff steals their wallets. Ben is about to tell the cafe they cannot pay when Anna is recognized and races off to avoid being identified as the First Daughter. Ben follows, and they tell a story of marrying, against the wishes of Anna's parents, to get a gondola ride from a kind-hearted gondolier, Eugenio (Joseph Long). Ben kisses Anna during the ride to hide her from the cafe staff's sight. Since they have no place to stay, Eugenio invites them to his and his mother Maria's (Miriam Margolyes) house. That night, thinking the kiss meant that Ben cares for her, Anna offers herself to him. To dissuade her, Ben is disingenuous and harsh. Anna finally gets in the bed alone, while Ben lies on the floor.The next day, Eugenio drives them to the Austrian border, as Weiss and Morales show up at Maria's looking for the gondolier with whom Anna and Ben were last seen.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the isotope is more unstable happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, a more unstable isotope can indirectly affect the growth of vegetables, but it won't affect the process you described. Let me explain how. The isotopes we're discussing here are usually radioactive isotopes, such as those of certain elements like uranium, thorium, potassium, etc. When these isotopes are unstable, they can decay and release radioactive particles and energy. This radioactive decay can potentially affect the vegetable growth in several ways, mainly: 1. Soil Contamination: If the isotopes are in the soil, their radioactive decay can release radiation, causing harm to the plants. It can damage plant tissues and impair their ability to photosynthesize, grow, or reproduce. Therefore, it might prevent the seeds from growing into healthy vegetable plants. 2. Water Contamination: If a water source gets contaminated with these isotopes, and if we use that water for watering the seeds/plants, it can potentially harm the plants. The harmful effects would be similar to what happens in the case of soil contamination. However, this perturbation doesn't directly affect the process you listed. You'd still carry out the steps in the same order and in the same manner: get seeds, plant them in a spot, water them, etc. What might change, however, is the outcome of the process. The seeds might not grow as well (or at all) if they're exposed to harmful radiation from the unstable isotopes. Lastly, remember that the presence of unstable isotopes and their possible effects depend on various factors, including their concentration, the specific isotope type, the duration of exposure, etc. In situations where you might be dealing with radioactive isotopes, it's crucial to use proper safety procedures and seek expert guidance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a lover of themed cafes, I was excited to pay a visit to this whimsically named spot, full of promises of an enchanting dining experience. Unfortunately, the reality fell significantly short of my expectations, and I feel obliged to share my observations in this negative review. Upon entering the cafe, I couldn't help but notice the lackluster ambiance. For a place called The Enchanted Forest, I was hoping for an atmosphere full of magic and wonder. Instead, the decor consisted of a few poorly maintained potted plants and faded posters of forest scenes on the walls. The air was heavy with the scent of mustiness, and I couldn't shake the feeling that the furniture and fixtures hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. The service was also a major disappointment. Although we were one of the few tables occupied that day, it took a considerable amount of time for the waitress to acknowledge our presence. When we finally received menus, we were taken aback by the limited range of dishes available. A themed cafe should have an interesting, unique menu, but The Enchanted Forest Cafe's offerings were limited to ordinary sandwiches, salads, and a small selection of entrees that seemed out of place in the mystical realm I had been expecting. When our food arrived, it was less than satisfactory. The presentation was lackluster, and the taste was bland at best. To be honest, it seemed as if the chef had given little thought to creating vibrant flavors or presenting the dishes in a way that would have captured the essence of an enchanted dining experience. Moreover, our meals were served cold, and we had to ask multiple times for condiments before they were finally brought to the table. The prices were also exorbitant, especially for the quality of the food. I paid a hefty sum for a subpar sandwich and lukewarm soup, which left me feeling like I'd been cheated. Instead of walking away with fond memories and a full stomach, I was filled with regret over spending my money on a meal that did not live up to the promised enchantment. On a positive note, the only enchanted aspect was a live performance in one corner of the cafe. The musicians played enchanting melodies, providing a glimmer of the magic we were looking for. Yet, the background music did little to make up for the overall disappointing experience. In conclusion, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend The Enchanted Forest Cafe. While the idea of an enchanting themed dining experience is appealing, the execution is painfully lacking in virtually every regard. From the disappointing decor and atmosphere to the subpar food and service, there is little to celebrate about this establishment. If you are seeking a delightful, otherworldly experience, it would be wise to look elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

CHAPTER X  BACK AT SCARCOMBE  The news of their destination had created great satisfaction among the crew, as there was little honour or prize-money to be gained, and the vessel had been for some time incessantly engaged in hunting for foes that were never found. Not the least pleased was Will. He had left England a friendless ship’s-boy; he returned home a midshipman, with a most creditable record, and with a fortune that, when he left the service, would enable him to live in more than comfort.  On arriving at Portsmouth the crew were at once paid off, and Will was appointed to the _Tartar_, a thirty-four gun frigate. On hearing the name of the ship, Dimchurch and Tom Stevens at once volunteered. They were given a fortnight’s leave; so Will, with Tom Stevens, determined to take a run up to Scarcombe, and the same day took coach to London. Dimchurch said he should spend his time in Portsmouth, as there was no one up in the north he cared to see, especially as it would take eight days out of his fortnight’s leave to go to his native place and back.  On the fourth day after leaving London the two travellers reached Scarborough. Tom Stevens started at once, with his kit on a stick, to walk to the village, while Will made enquiries for the house of Mrs. Archer, which was Miss Warden’s married name. Without much trouble he made his way to it; and when the servant answered his knock he said: “I wish to see Mrs. Archer.”  Answer the following questions: 1. Was the crew happy about the news they received? 2. Why? 3. Where was the ship headed? 4. Did they have to leave again immediately? 5. How much time did they have there? 6. Where did Will and Tom decide to go? 7. Where was the first stop on their journey there? 8. How did they go to London? 9. Did Dimchurch come with them? 10. Did he go to his home instead? 11. How many days from London was Scarborough? 12. Did Will and Tom continue together after reaching there? 13. Where did Tom go? 14. And Will? 15. Did she have another name formerly? 16. What was it? 17. Why did she change her name? 18. What was her first name? 19. Was it difficult for Will to find her house? 20. Who answered the door there? Numbered answers:","output":"1.

To answer this, it's important to think about what kind of water is suitable for making Kool-Aid. Kool-Aid is typically mixed with clean, fresh water which is free from high salt content or any other impurities that could alter its taste. Now, considering the answer options according to these criteria: A. Faucet water: Many households use faucet water for drinking and food preparation. It's generally treated and safe to consume, making it suitable for mixing Kool-Aid.   B. Well water: While well water might have some impurities depending on the source, many rural areas rely on it for drinking and food preparation. It can be suitable for mixing Kool-Aid as well, after ensuring it is safe to drink. C. Seawater: Seawater, as noted in the initial fact, contains large amounts of salt. This saltiness would be undesirable in Kool-Aid and could also pose health risks if consumed in large quantities. D. Bottled water: Bottled water is often purified and very safe to consume, making it suitable for mixing Kool-Aid.

It may not come close to Agatha Christie or even Thin Man mysteries as a film noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical \\"boy meets girl\\" or \\"let's put on a show\\" backstage musical.

Sure, but the search is fun, even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief (luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls, Toby Wing).

What did the U.S. buy from Russia for 2 cents an acre? What is the answer?","output":"Step 1: Identify the question The question asks what the U.S. bought from Russia for 2 cents an acre. Step 2: Recall relevant historical events The United States purchased land from Russia in 1867. This transaction is known as the Alaska Purchase or Seward's Folly, after the US Secretary of State William H. Seward who negotiated the deal. Step 3: Identify the price and calculate the cost per acre The Alaska Purchase involved the United States paying Russia 7.2 million for approximately 586,412 square miles of land.  Step 4: Calculate the price per acre We want to find out if the cost was indeed 2 cents per acre. First, let's convert the total price to cents by multiplying it by 100: 7,200,000 * 100 = 720,000,000 cents. Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of acres: 720,000,000 cents / 586,412 square miles. Step 5: Convert square miles to acres 1 square mile is equal to 640 acres. So, 586,412 square miles * 640 acres = 375,302,080 acres. Step 6: Calculate the final price per acre Now we can determine the price per acre: 720,000,000 cents / 375,302,080 acres ≈ 1.92 cents per acre. Step 7: Answer the question The U.S. bought Alaska from Russia for approximately 1.92 cents per acre, which is close to the 2 cents mentioned in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This piece exemplifies the musical genre known as ragtime, which emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. Ragtime was a precursor to jazz, and it played a crucial role in shaping the development of American popular music. Ragtime is characterized by its syncopated, or \\"ragged,\\" rhythms, created by playing against the regular metrical accents of a piece. The genre originated from African-American roots, particularly in the musical traditions of African-Americans in the South. It evolved over time with influences from European classical music, particularly the march form popularized by composers like John Philip Sousa. This blend of African syncopation and European classical forms birthed a unique and innovative musical style. One of the defining features of ragtime is its signature syncopated rhythm typically played on a piano. The pianist's left hand usually plays a rhythmically steady bass line with chords or a march-like rhythm, while the right hand focuses on the syncopated, or off-beat, melodic line. This integration of melodic syncopation against a steady rhythm creates a rhythmic tension, or \\"swing,\\" which is characteristic of ragtime music. Scott Joplin is widely regarded as the \\"King of Ragtime,\\" and his compositions, including \\"The Entertainer,\\" \\"Maple Leaf Rag,\\" and \\"The Easy Winners\\" are still celebrated today as benchmarks within the genre. \\"The Entertainer\\" is a perfect example of Joplin's compositional prowess; it features a catchy and memorable melody with intricate patterns of syncopation against a steady bass line – all hallmarks of ragtime music. While the ragtime genre was initially popularized through sheet music sold for piano players, it soon expanded to include other instrumental ensembles, most notably brass bands and small orchestras. During its peak around the 1910s, ragtime was featured in dance halls, saloons, and even early silent films as an accompaniment. Although ragtime's popularity began to decline in the 1920s with the emergence of jazz music and other forms of popular entertainment, it experienced a resurgence in the 1970s following the release of the 1973 film \\"The Sting.\\" The movie's soundtrack, which prominently featured Joplin's \\"The Entertainer\\" and \\"Solace,\\" rekindled interest in the ragtime genre, leading to a revival of both Joplin's music and the ragtime style in general. In conclusion, \\"The Entertainer\\" by Scott Joplin exemplifies the ragtime genre, characterized by its syncopated rhythms, piano-centered compositions, and blending of African roots with European classical influences. Ragtime laid the groundwork for the development of jazz and is still recognized today as a foundational element of American popular music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pioneer of party-plan marketing, Earl Tupper invented what during his stay at DuPont????","output":"Earl Tupper, a chemist and inventor, revolutionized the world of food storage and home products when he invented Tupperware during his stay at DuPont in the 1940s. Earl Tupper was born in 1907 in Berlin, New Hampshire. After working various jobs in the early 1930s, he joined the plastics division of DuPont in 1936, where he became interested in polyethylene, a newly discovered plastic material that he believed could be used to create a wide range of household products. Polyethylene was flexible, durable, and resistant to the effects of moisture, making it an ideal material for his purposes. During World War II, DuPont shifted its focus to supporting the war effort; however, Tupper continued his experiments with plastics. In 1942, he founded the Tupper Plastics Company to produce and sell his plastic products. Although he created many items, his real ingenuity was applied in designing the containers we now know as Tupperware. Tupperware containers were unique and innovative. They featured airtight seals, which hadn't been used before in consumer food storage products. The 'burping seal' was a pioneering design that allowed air to escape from the container, ensuring that the contents stayed fresh by preventing oxygen from entering. Earl Tupper's invention quickly became popular due to its effectiveness in preserving food freshness and preventing spills. It was during this time that he also created the party-plan marketing model, which played a crucial role in the success of Tupperware. Party-plan marketing was a direct sales approach that relied on hosting parties in people's homes to sell products. Tupper partnered with Brownie Wise, a successful saleswoman, in the late 1940s. Wise came up with the idea of Tupperware parties, where the host would invite friends and neighbors for a demonstration of the product. Guests could try out different containers, order customized ones, and even host their own parties. This innovative marketing method turned Tupperware into a household name and led to its sales soaring. It also gave rise to an entire industry based on the party-plan marketing model, which allowed people, especially women, to earn income and build their own businesses from home. Earl Tupper's contribution to society was twofold - his invention of the revolutionary Tupperware products and his adoption of the party-plan marketing strategy that made the brand so popular. His ingenuity transformed food storage and contributed to the empowerment of women, who became the backbone of Tupperware sales and established successful careers through this innovative means of entrepreneurship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Describe the negative aspects of the restaurant, with specific details and explanations. Unfortunately, the overall experience was quite disappointing. Firstly, we had to wait for more than 40 minutes to get a table, even though we had a reservation. Once seated, it took another 30 minutes for our order to be taken. The food, on the other hand, was underwhelming. My wife's pasta dish tasted bland, and it seemed as if the sauce was store-bought rather than homemade. My steak was overcooked, even though I specifically requested it to be medium-rare. The presentation was lackluster as well, with barely any garnishes or effort put into making the dishes visually appealing. Moreover, the service was equally unsatisfactory. The waiter seemed uninterested and took a long time to attend to our requests for drink refills, extra napkins, and the check.

The citrusy flavor left a sour note on her tongue that she preferred to avoid. Instead, she sought the comfort of a warm, sweet cup of tea that could soothe her nerves and provide a much-needed moment of relaxation. When she added the honey, the thick, golden liquid seemed to melt seamlessly into the steaming liquid, dissolving softly and imparting its rich, unique sweetness into the tea.  As she stirred the tea gently, she watched the honey create swirling patterns in the dark amber liquid, like a dance between two familiar elements. The delightful scent of her tea wafted up to her nose, inviting her to take her first sip.

Each sip was more delicious than the last, as the honey-infused tea seemed to envelop her taste buds in a gentle embrace, reassuring her at the end of a long and tiring day. The absence of lemon no longer mattered; it was the taste of golden syrupy honey that stole the show, transporting her mind to a quiet place of peace, tranquility, and indulgence. Over time, she had perfected her tea preparation routine, recognizing that honey was not only a preferred taste but also carried significant health benefits. The antioxidant properties, natural enzymes, and minerals present in honey made it an ideal addition to her daily cup of tea, providing immune-boosting benefits and contributions to her overall wellness – without the lemon's sharp tanginess. She found that the honey-enriched tea soothed her throat during cold months, while its antibacterial properties kept minor infections at bay. As she sat in her favorite armchair, cradling her steaming cup of honey-infused tea between her hands, she closed her eyes and let her thoughts drift away. Soaking in the peaceful ambiance, accompanied only by the steady rhythm of raindrops on the window, she realized that, with each sip of her tea, the weight of the day's worries seemed to dissipate. It was in these quiet moments of reflection, savoring the soothing taste of honey in her drink devoid of lemon's sourness, that she found the strength to face the next day's challenges with renewed energy and determination. In the end, leaving the lemon out of her tea and opting for generous dollops of honey created a beverage perfectly tailored to her taste and well-being. She had discovered a unique, personal ritual that not only provided her with moments of calm, but it also infused her life with a thread of sweetness and warmth – like the embrace of a dear friend who had witnessed her trials and triumphs, and would be there for her whenever she needed solace and comfort.

Sea cucumbers are deposit feeders, living on the ocean floor. They eat the tiny scrap particles that are usually abundant in the environments that they inhabit.   Q: What are are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter?   Choices:  - bottom feeders  - difference feeders  - waste feeders  - deposit feeders  A: The answer is:","output":"Deposit feeders. Deposit feeders are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter, typically found in the top layer of soil or sediment. These feeders play a vital role in the recycling of nutrients within their respective ecosystems, as they consume and break down organic debris into smaller particles. This in turn makes the nutrients more available to other organisms, promoting overall ecosystem health and stability. As mentioned in the given paragraph, sea cucumbers are an example of deposit feeders in marine environments. Living on the ocean floor, they consume tiny bits of organic matter, or detritus, which are abundant in their habitats. This feeding method not only provides nourishment for the sea cucumbers but also supports an array of other organisms that share their habitat. Simultaneously, deposit feeders help to maintain the balance of nutrients within their environments by breaking down organic matter and facilitating its cycling through the ecosystem. In comparison, the other options provided do not accurately describe organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter: - Bottom feeders: This term refers to aquatic animals or fish that feed on or near the bottom of a body of water. While some deposit feeders may be classified as bottom feeders, the term bottom feeder is more general and does not specifically identify organisms feeding exclusively on small organic particles. - Difference feeders: This is not a recognized term for any specific type of feeding behavior or group of organisms in the field of ecology or biology. - Waste feeders: While some deposit feeders may consume waste materials, this term is not specific enough to describe all deposit feeders. Waste feeders can refer to a broader range of organisms that feed on the waste of other organisms, but this does not exclusively involve feeding on small organic particles. In conclusion, deposit feeders are the organisms that specifically feed on small pieces of organic matter, playing a significant role in nutrient recycling and ecosystem health. Sea cucumbers are a prime example of deposit feeders in marine ecosystems, contributing to the overall functioning and balance of their environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is Saudi arabia?\\"  Context: \\"According to Johnson and Grim (2013), Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910, of which 137 million were in Asia, to 495 million in 2010, of which 487 million are in Asia. According to them, there was a fast annual growth of Buddhism in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and several Western European countries (1910–2010). More recently (2000–2010), the countries with highest growth rates are Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and some African countries.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is a sovereign country located in the Middle East and occupies the majority of the Arabian Peninsula. As the largest country in the Middle East, it is bordered by Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen, as well as the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Although the context you provided discusses the growth of Buddhism in various countries, including some Middle Eastern nations such as Lebanon and Saudi Arabia from 1910 to 2010, it is vital to clarify that Saudi Arabia is predominantly an Islamic country. The nation is known for its significance to Islam, as it is home to the religion's two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, where millions of Muslims from around the world visit annually to perform Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. The establishment of the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia dates back to 1932 when Abdulaziz Al Saud unified the kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd. It has since evolved into the center of power in the region. Due to its vast oil reserves, Saudi Arabia is considered an economic powerhouse and a major player in global energy markets. The country is one of the founding members of the OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and has the second-largest proven oil reserves globally. Although Saudi Arabia is primarily an Islamic country, the context implies that there has been a noticeable growth in Buddhism from 1910 to 2010. Indeed, other religious groups, including Buddhists, are present in the nation primarily due to its vast expatriate workforce drawn from various countries for employment opportunities. However, these non-Muslim religious practices are typically restricted to private spaces, as Saudi Arabia's legal system adheres to a strict interpretation of Sunni Islamic law, leaving no room for other forms of public religious expression. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has undergone several economic and social reforms under its ambitious Vision 2030 plan, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This plan seeks to diversify the country's economy away from oil dependency and make significant strides in areas like education, infrastructure, and tourism. These changes may gradually lead to increased multiculturalism and a more open environment for people of different faiths, including Buddhists, to practice their religion, albeit discreetly and privately. In conclusion, Saudi Arabia is a powerful and influential Islamic nation situated in the Middle East, with a strong connection to Islamic culture and history. The context provided regarding the growth of Buddhism in Saudi Arabia and other countries during the 20th and 21st centuries suggests that the presence of diverse religious groups has expanded, predominantly owing to expatriate workers. Nonetheless, public religious expression remains limited to Islam, with non-Muslims typically restricted to practicing their faith privately."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was mamas mink jacket?\\" is \\"A friend hand-me-down\\"?","output":"No, sweetie, that's not correct. Mama's mink jacket was described as a \\"family hand-me-down\\" in the story. That means it was given to her by someone in her family who used it before. It is like when your older brother or sister gives you toys they no longer play with. Those toys are hand-me-downs because they were handed down to you. So, we can say that Mama's mink jacket was an old jacket passed down from someone else in her family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Now, I have a new situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  Answer this question please: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force?","output":"The group whose cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force is Group George. The kinetic-molecular theory you described provides an explanation for this scenario. The heat from the campfire added kinetic energy to the air molecules inside the soup cans. As a result, these air molecules began moving faster, colliding with the container walls more frequently and with greater force.  In the case of Group Jones, they did not vent the cans before heating them. This meant that the interior of the can became a closed system, with no opportunity for the increasing pressure to escape. As the can heated, the air molecules inside moved faster due to an increase in thermal energy from the fire, which led to more frequent and stronger collisions with the can walls. This escalation in pressure ultimately exceeded the physical limit of the can, causing it to explode. On the other hand, Group George vented their cans before heating them. This provided an outlet for the pressure to escape as the air inside the can heated up and expanded. The movement of the air molecules and their impact against the can wall would still increase due to the heat, but the force of these impacts would be significantly reduced because the excess pressure could escape through the vent hole. This venting action effectively prevented a dangerous build-up of pressure inside the can, allowing Group George to safely heat their cans of soup over the campfire. As a result, the air molecules inside the cans of Group George would have impacted the container walls with considerably less force than those in the unvented cans of Group Jones. Therefore, Group George's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force."},{"instruction":"Q:Where do investment bankers hang out in the suburbs? - wall street - city hall - monopoly game - michigan - country club  The best answer is A:","output":"country club"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... Question: what are the factors that make one a refugee === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The factors that make one a refugee are primarily based on the definition provided by the 1951 United Nation's Refugee Convention. According to this definition, a refugee is someone who: 1. Has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. This means that the person has a genuine and significant reason to believe that they will be targeted and harmed due to their identity or beliefs. 2. Is outside the country of their nationality. To be considered a refugee, a person must have fled their home country and crossed an international border. Individuals who are displaced within their own country are referred to as internally displaced persons (IDPs), and while they may face similar challenges, they are not considered refugees under international law. 3. Is unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their own country. This indicates that the person cannot safely return to their home country, either because the government is unable or unwilling to protect them from harm, or because the individual fears retaliation upon their return. It is important to note that these factors are considered in the context of specific circumstances in a given country or region. The factors that make someone a refugee may vary depending on the nature of the conflict or persecution taking place. For example, refugees fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, Iraq, or Libya primarily face violence, civil unrest, and political instability, whereas refugees from other countries might be escaping targeted persecution by their governments or other groups due to their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason prefers eating tangerines over oranges, because the  Pick from: --tangerines are smaller and easier to eat.; --oranges are smaller and easier to eat.;","output":"tangerines are smaller and easier to eat. In comparison to oranges, tangerines have thinner skin that makes them faster and more convenient to peel. Their small segments are easier to separate and enjoy one by one, making them an on-the-go snack that doesn't require much effort. In Jason's busy life, having a food item that is simpler to handle is particularly appealing. Furthermore, Jason enjoys the unique flavor profile of tangerines. Tangerines have a sweeter and less acidic taste compared to oranges, which is highly appreciated by many, including Jason. That is because tangerines have a higher concentration of natural sugars, while still providing the vit-C kick and a boost to the immune system, making them a healthy and tasty choice. Another reason why Jason prefers tangerines over oranges is their portability. Tangerines are known for their small size, which means they can easily fit into lunchboxes, purses, or even pockets. Their distinct shape and easy-to-handle nature make them a go-to snack not only for Jason but also for many people who are looking for a quick, healthy bite. In addition, tangerines are often found to have a thinner pith than oranges. Pith is the white, spongy layer between the fruit's skin and the flesh, and it is often bitter in taste. Since tangerines have a thinner pith, there is less of it to remove, ultimately easing the overall process of enjoying their succulent taste. This contributes to Jason's preference for tangerines, as it further emphasizes the convenience factor. An added bonus to choosing tangerines over oranges is that they are usually seedless or have very few seeds. This difference makes a huge impact on the overall eating experience, ensuring a smooth and pleasant consumption. Not having to worry about seeds is particularly important to Jason, who enjoys focusing on the taste of the fruit and not having to deal with seeds getting in his way. In conclusion, Jason prefers tangerines over oranges due to their smaller size, thin skin, unique sweet flavor, portability, thin pith, and lower seed content. Overall, tangerines provide Jason with a convenient and enjoyable snacking experience that is unmatched by their larger counterpart, oranges. It is their ease of eating and distinctive taste that makes tangerines Jason's preferred choice of citrus fruit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.  Question: \\"What is the physical property that causes particles to attract or repel each other?\\" Answer: \\"Electrical charge causes particles to attract or repel each other\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. Based on the paragraph, electrical charge is indeed the physical property that causes particles or objects to attract or repel each other. It is due to the presence of positive and negative charges in the form of protons and electrons within atoms. When an object gains or loses electrons, it becomes either negatively or positively charged, respectively. These charged objects then experience attractive or repulsive forces between them, depending on the nature of their charges (opposite charges attract, while like charges repel). This phenomenon is fundamental to the understanding of electromagnetism and the behavior of charged particles in various systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve -297*c - 54*c = 6669 for c.","output":"Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. We have two terms with the variable c (-297c and -54c). We will combine these terms by adding them together. -297c + (-54c) = -297c - 54c Step 2: Add the coefficients of the c terms. The coefficients of the c terms are -297 and -54. Add these two values together: -297 + (-54) = -351 Now the equation looks like this: -351c = 6669 Step 3: Solve for the variable c. In order to solve for the variable c, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since we have -351c on the left side, we will divide both sides of the equation by -351 to isolate c. -351c / (-351) = 6669 / (-351) Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. When we divide both sides of the equation by -351, we get: c = -19 So the solution to the problem is c = -19."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who succeed in repairing an aircraft? from the following article ?  The US Army is conducting a fighting retreat. A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up.  There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time. The remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting heavy losses and ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed, leaving only Dane, Todd, and a wounded Purckett alive. Purckett is shot, while Todd stabbed through the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead. Before he dies, Todd admits to Dane he is Burns.

The groups have voiced their concerns over the significant impact these emissions have on both air quality and climate change. In response, they are urging the EPA to implement stricter controls on the aviation industry in order to protect public health and the environment. Aircraft emissions are known to contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gases, leading to detrimental effects on human health, wildlife, and the climate. Studies have shown that emissions generated by the aviation industry account for a significant portion of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. As air travel increases in popularity, the industry's emission levels continue to rise. Environmental advocates argue that existing regulations are insufficient and outdated, leaving a major gap in protecting the environment and public health from the effects of aircraft emissions. They believe that the EPA has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue and must act with urgency to establish tighter emission standards. The groups recognize the complexities of regulating an industry that operates across international boundaries and may involve varying levels of environmental standards. However, they believe that the EPA has the authority to not only establish but also enforce emission regulations on aircraft within the United States. In doing so, the measure is expected to encourage other nations to follow suit, leading to a global reduction in aircraft-related emissions.  In their petition, the environmental groups also emphasize the need for the development and implementation of cleaner, more sustainable aviation technologies. They believe that by setting stricter emissions standards, the EPA can incentivize the aviation industry to invest in the research and development of innovative solutions that can contribute to greener and more efficient travel. This shift toward sustainable technologies would align with the overall objective of reducing global CO2 emissions and mitigating climate change. As the petition awaits further consideration and action from the EPA, the environmental groups behind the initiative remain hopeful that their efforts will pave the way for meaningful change in the aviation industry. By regulating aircraft emissions, the EPA could help to protect public health and the environment, while simultaneously encouraging industry-wide innovation in sustainable aviation practices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Consider putting together a basic routine to boost your fitness level. Whether or not you have access to a gym, start with the basics at home: push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and, if you have access to weights, basic squats, curls, and bench presses.  If you’re not sure of where to begin—what exercises to include in your routine, what weights to lift, etc.—talk to your gym coach or check online for teen weight-training recommendations. Before each workout, start with about 10 minutes of mild stretches. Warming up helps prevent injury and can help to maximize the calories burnt during your entire workout.  Similarly, if you take the time to taper off your workout with cooling-down stretches you will feel less taxed when you are done. Over time, if you find that you enjoy running, think about joining a cross country team. Find a friend who also wants to be active during the week and exercise with them. You can also ask members of your family (siblings, cousins, even parents) if they’d like to exercise with you. It’ll be easier to stay motivated to be fit if you have a friend or family member to exercise with and who can provide moral support. Having a friend to support you will make you more likely to stick with your exercise regime. Summary:","output":"To boost your fitness level, create a basic routine with exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and weight training.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: 11 Diagonal Street, location, South Africa; South Africa, leader, Cyril Ramaphosa; South Africa, ethnicGroup, Asian South Africans. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided consists of diverse information about South Africa, specifically pertaining to a location, the leader, and an ethnic group found within the country. 1. Location: 11 Diagonal Street, South Africa 11 Diagonal Street is a noteworthy location situated in Johannesburg, one of the most iconic cities in South Africa. Johannesburg serves as the economic heart of the country and has grown exponentially since the late 19th century, following the discovery of vast gold reserves. It is considered the largest city in South Africa, and its unique architecture reflects a rich blend of historical and contemporary influences. 11 Diagonal Street refers to a distinctive building within the city limits, designed by renowned architect Helmut Jahn in a structural expressionist style. Completed in 1984, this 80-meter high office building stands like a set of stacked cubes slightly twisted on their axis. The design allows the edifice to respond optimally to its unique location opposite the South African Reserve Bank, with reflective glass surfaces mirroring nearby buildings and urban scenes. As such, it has become a visual representation of Johannesburg's financial district and has contributed greatly to the city's iconic skyline. 2. Leader: Cyril Ramaphosa Cyril Ramaphosa is a distinguished political figure who serves as the fifth and current President of South Africa since February 2018. Born on November 17, 1952, in Soweto, Ramaphosa has a background in law, having studied at the University of South Africa before gaining prominence in both the trade union movement and the African National Congress (ANC) party.  As South Africa strived for equality during the apartheid era, Ramaphosa emerged as a key negotiator in the country's transition to democracy in the early 1990s. Following the historic election of Nelson Mandela in 1994, Ramaphosa occupied various political roles such as Member of Parliament and even chaired the Constitutional Assembly responsible for drafting South Africa's current Constitution.  In recent years, Ramaphosa has focused on addressing South Africa's most pressing issues, including economic reform, reducing inequality, and tackling corruption within the political sphere. His leadership is pivotal in steering the nation toward a more transparent and democratic governance that uplifts all citizens equitably. 3. Ethnic Group: Asian South Africans Asian South Africans represent a significant ethnic group within the diverse population of South Africa. Primarily hailing from South Asia (comprising countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and South-East Asia (comprising countries like China, Vietnam, and Malaysia), these communities have established deep roots within the nation across several generations. The history of Asian South Africans can be traced back to the late 19th century when indentured laborers from India were brought to work on sugar plantations in the area known today as KwaZulu-Natal. Over time, various waves of migration from other Asian countries have contributed to the diverse and vibrant melting pot that constitutes contemporary South African society. Although discrimination existed during the apartheid era, particularly against Indian South Africans with the introduction of the Group Areas Act, the post-apartheid period has seen efforts to rectify these historical injustices and embrace the nation's diversity. Today, Asian South Africans play pivotal roles across all spheres of society, including politics, business, and the arts. Their rich cultural heritage contributes significantly to South Africa's unique tapestry of ethnic identities and shared history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Jordan’s Bulls set an NBA record with 72 wins, but they were this close to 75 In May 1995, Michael Jordan had already stopped wearing No. 45. The front and back of his Chicago Bulls jersey was adorned with the 2 and the 3 — again. It was a reminder of the Michael Jordan of old — the Jordan the world knew before his baseball stint south of the Mason-Dixon line where his batting average hovered just above the Mendoza line. But even with his old number on his chest, Jordan’s team wasn’t having the success for which that 23 was known. The Bulls fell to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, Jordan’s first loss in a Game 7 since 1990. “It’s very disappointing,” Jordan said after the defeat. “I’ve got a whole summer to say what if. What if I made the jump shots down the stretch? What if I’d been here a whole season? What if I’d been here last season?” The following year, the what-ifs had subsided. The Bulls set fire to the league during the 1995-96 season, winning an NBA-record 72 games en route to the first of three more titles. But they were closer than you think to have an even better record. With the Golden State Warriors now threatening to break that 72-win record this season (through 62 games, they have 56 wins; the Bulls had 55), we’re taking a look back at how the 1995-96 Bulls could have really gone 75-7, if not for just a few bad breaks. [Lakers shock Warriors for biggest regular season upset in NBA history] For starters, Jordan’s Bulls lost three times over the final 21 games of the season. Each of those losses was by a margin of just one point. Even more surprising: Those were the Bulls’ only three games of the regular season decided by a one-point margin. And at least two of those games involved a player with a direct tie to the present-day Warriors, who may surpass the Bulls’ record. By the time March rolled around, Toronto had already lost to the Bulls three times in its bumpy inaugural NBA season. First, there was a pair of nine-point defeats. Then came a three-point loss in Chicago in January. Two months later, north of the border, the Raptors got their revenge. With 24 seconds remaining, Jordan missed a driving layup that was rebounded by Toronto’s Oliver Miller, who then promptly called a timeout. One problem: The Raptors didn’t have any timeouts remaining. As fate would have it, the Raptors were bailed out as Jordan was called for a foul prior to the timeout signal. Miller then made the first free throw and missed the second; Scottie Pippen rebounded and called a timeout. Leading to the final play… So yeah, maybe Steve Kerr (who now coaches the Warriors now) was planning for the future with this miss? But imagine the shot and Jordan’s subsequent rebound had come just a few tenths of second earlier. Jordan’s final bucket would have counted and the Bulls would have win No. 73. A cruel twist from the clock. The Bulls’ mastery at United Center had spanned 44 games (an NBA record for consecutive home wins until the mark was surpassed by the Warriors on Monday night), with Chicago’s last home loss on March 24, 1995 to the same team that would oust them from the postseason two months later — the Magic. Then the Hornets came to town. Charlotte star Larry Johnson played just 23 minutes with a nagging hand injury and scored just eight points. Off the bench came — who else? — Dell Curry. Yes, that Dell Curry. The father of Stephen Curry, who had just turned 8 years old March 24. And on this night, the elder Curry was the hero for the Hornets He scored 19 points and hit the final two free throws to give Charlotte the 98-97 lead prior to the Bulls’ final possession. In case you are keeping count, that is two straight Bulls defeats, by one point, in the final seconds, involving the Warriors’ current coach and the father of the best basketball player on the planet right now — who plays for the Warriors. Eerie. Nearly two years before this game, NBA referee Hue Hollins made probably the most memorable questionable call in the history of the Bulls franchise. And 23 months later, with .05 seconds remaining vs. the Pacers, Hollins called No. 23 for maybe the second most memorable questionable call. However, it might not have mattered the second time had Jordan made this jumper with seven seconds remaining. The Pacers pushed the ball up court to Eddie Johnson. He had made one bucket in 12 minutes prior to his final attempt. The foul sent Johnson to the line, who made just one of two free throws for the win. And in case you’re wondering, no, Johnson didn’t every play for or coach the Warriors. He was actually born in Chicago. So much for our Warriors connections. Back to 2016: If Golden State is perfect in its final 21 games, its 76 wins would top even this hypothetical win total by the Bulls. So “what if” wouldn’t even matter. But perhaps the biggest “what if” to take away from all of this: What if Pippen hadn’t shot 12-of-35 combined (28 total points) in those three Bulls defeats? Then there wouldn’t be a need for those two, nagging words. Dan is the sports design editor at The Washington Post.

Information:  - , or Capcom, is a Japanese developer and publisher of video games, known for creating multi-million-selling franchises such as \\"Mega Man\\", \\"Street Fighter\\", \\"Resident Evil\\", \\"Devil May Cry\\", \\"Ace Attorney\\", and \\"Monster Hunter,\\" as well as games based on the Disney animated properties. Originally established in 1979, it has since become an international enterprise with subsidiaries in North America, Europe, and East Asia.  - , commonly abbreviated as \\"SF\\" or  (\\"Suto\\"), is a fighting video game franchise by Capcom. The second game in the series is credited with establishing many of the conventions of the one-on-one fighting genre. The game's playable characters originate from different countries around the world, each with a unique fighting style. It is Capcom's second best-selling franchise, having had significant success worldwide. The first game in the series was released in 1987.  - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems.  - The , stylized as NINTENDO and often referred to as N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is the industry's last major successive home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, as all succeeding home consoles up until the Nintendo Switch used an optical format. In addition, current handheld systems (such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003.  - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - Body Blows is an Amiga versus fighting game. It was released in 1993 by Team17. The game is compatible with all Amiga systems, including the CDTV system with joystick support. It was followed by \\"Body Blows Galactic\\" and \\"Ultimate Body Blows\\". A version for DOS was also released. The game has a lot of similarities to \\"Street Fighter II\\", for example, both had two characters with projectile, rising uppercut and spinning kick special moves and played identically (as with Ryu and Ken).  - Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) is a fighting video game developed by Midway Games and first released into arcades in 1995 as the third game in the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" series. As in the previous games, it has a cast of characters that players choose from and guide through a series of battles against other opponents. The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors, as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn, who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm.  - Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a fighting video game released by Midway in 1996 as an update to \\"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3\\". Unlike the previous title, it was not released in arcades (except for prototypes), but was instead released for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn and PCs. Further versions were also released for the Game.com and R-Zone.  - Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (\\"UMK3\\") is a fighting video game in the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" series, originally developed and released by Midway Games to arcades in 1995. It is an update of 1995's earlier \\"Mortal Kombat 3\\" with an altered gameplay system, additional characters like the returning favorites Kitana and Scorpion who were missing from \\"Mortal Kombat 3\\", and some new features.  - Ultimate Body Blows is a 1994 Amiga CD32 and DOS fighting game . It is largely an amalgamation of Body Blows and Body Blows Galactic released in 1993 by Team 17 , featuring characters and locales from both games but using the HUD and menu interface of the first game . To this end , the game is comparable to Midway 's Mortal Kombat Trilogy , although the gameplay ( and several of the characters ) perhaps owe more to Capcom 's Street Fighter series .  - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - The is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe as the successor to the successful Sega Genesis. The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original titles.  - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.  - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems.  - Body Blows Galactic is a fighting game developed and published by Team17 in for the Amiga computers. It is a sequel to 1992's \\"Body Blows\\". Opponents and background graphics from both games were later merged into the compilation release \\"Ultimate Body Blows\\".  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer and Maria both had unprotected sex with the same man. This man, unbeknownst to them, has hepatitis b. Both women go to the doctor to get checked out. Jennifer reports that she is coughing frequently and has a congested nose. The doctor notices that Maria has yellow eyes and she tells the doctor that she has been throwing up.  But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.  What is an answer for this question: Who will probably not be prescribed medicine for their liver? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Jennifer will probably not be prescribed medicine for her liver. This is because her symptoms, such as coughing frequently and having a congested nose, do not align with the typical symptoms of Hepatitis B, which include vomiting and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Maria, on the other hand, exhibits symptoms consistent with Hepatitis B, such as yellow eyes and vomiting. Therefore, it is likely that the doctor would consider prescribing medicine for Maria's liver to help prevent liver damage.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the current is unusually strong because of rip tides happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Acid rain is a byproduct of human activity and natural sources involving the emission of gases containing sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These gases, when released into the atmosphere, react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which then fall to the ground in rain or snow. The process of acid rain has several negative impacts on the environment, including damage to rocks, soil, vegetation, and aquatic life. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an unusual event such as strong rip currents caused by fluctuating weather patterns could potentially lead to an increase in the harmful effects of acid rain. Rip currents are strong, narrow channels of water that move quickly away from the shore, typically through the surf zone. They are caused by the interaction of waves with the shape of the seabed and coastline. In this case, the perturbation hypothesis posits that the unusual strength of rip currents could indirectly impact the effects of acid rain on the environment. There are several ways that unusually strong rip currents could influence the effects of acid rain, including: 1. Redistribution of polluted water: Strong rip currents could potentially distribute acidic water over a larger area by dragging polluted waters from one location to another. This may increase the overall impact of acid rain on a broader ecosystem, potentially affecting plants and animals that were previously unaffected by the acidic conditions. 2. Soil erosion: Rip currents can cause significant erosion of the shorelines, particularly in areas with looser soil or sand. In turn, this alters the surrounding environment, potentially exacerbating the effects of acid rain. Soil erosion can lead to a loss of vegetation, which may further affect local wildlife and ecosystems. 3. Sediment disruption: Alongside soil erosion, strong rip currents can cause sediment to be churned up from the sea floor and introduced into the water column. This can have a disruptive effect on local aquatic ecosystems, as the added sediment can block sunlight from reaching underwater plants and disrupt the feeding habits of filter-feeding animals. In combination with acid rain, this disruption to the aquatic ecosystem could heighten the overall damage to the environment. 4. Interference with natural buffering and dissipation processes: Natural processes (both physical and biological) can help to neutralize and dissipate the acidity of rainwater, reducing its impact on the environment. The presence of strong rip currents could interfere with these processes, potentially leading to an increased persistence of acidic conditions in the affected area. In conclusion, while rip currents themselves do not directly contribute to acid rain production or increase its acidity, their influence on the environment can indirectly exacerbate the effects of acid rain. The unusual strength of rip currents may lead to a redistribution of polluted water, soil erosion, sediment disruption, and interference with natural buffering and dissipation processes, all of which may contribute to heightened environmental damage. As such, it is essential to monitor and mitigate the impacts of both acid rain and other environmental perturbations to protect the health and stability of our ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who was the majority group in Sao Paulo province?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.

Watchdog claims it needs to access records to monitor 'clinical quality' Experts describe it as 'fishing exercise' undermining patient confidentiality. CQC claims it has snooping powers under Health and Social Care Act 2008. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Privacy Concerns Rise as Health Inspectors Access Medical Records during Surgery Checks In a move that has raised alarm among privacy advocates and the medical community, health inspectors conducting surgery checks have begun to access patient medical records. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), the watchdog that oversees these inspections, claims this access is necessary to ensure the highest standard of clinical quality. Some experts, however, see this as a breach of patient confidentiality that may discourage patients from openly sharing sensitive health information with their healthcare providers. The CQC maintains that its inspectors require access to medical records and other pertinent patient information in order to properly evaluate surgery procedures and outcomes. This information, they argue, is crucial in determining whether a healthcare provider is fully meeting regulatory standards, as outlined by the Health and Social Care Act 2008. CQC officials state that this unprecedented level of access allows them to effectively safeguard patients and ensure the best possible quality of care. Nonetheless, critics argue that this so-called \\"snooping\\" goes beyond the boundaries of acceptable oversight and undermines the fundamental principle of patient confidentiality. To them, the CQC's decision to access medical records seems like a \\"fishing exercise\\" that could possibly reveal sensitive patient details, which may not have any bearing on the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals. Concerns over patient privacy have been exacerbated as several experts have pointed out that the CQC has provided vague guidance on how inspectors will preserve confidentiality while accessing patient records. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the potentially inappropriate handling of sensitive information, which could lead to breaches of patient privacy. Aside from the obvious privacy concerns, there are concerns that this practice could have negative consequences on the doctor-patient relationship. By accessing records without patient consent, CQC inspectors are potentially eroding the trust that exists between healthcare professionals and their patients. This could deter patients from being forthcoming about their medical history or mental health issues, fearing that their information may be accessed without their knowledge or consent. Some medical professionals fear that undermining patient confidentiality may lead to a decline in the number of patients who willingly disclose sensitive health information, persuading them to forego necessary care out of distrust. This, in turn, can lead to poorer health outcomes and a strain on medical resources, as conditions that could have been resolved early may worsen and require more extensive interventions.  In light of these concerns, many are calling on the CQC to reassess its approach and consider adopting alternative measures that prioritize patient privacy and respect the doctor-patient relationship. This could involve seeking explicit patient consent before accessing medical records or implementing additional safeguards to protect patient confidentiality during inspections. The controversy surrounding the CQC's medical record access highlights the tension between safeguarding patient data and ensuring exceptional clinical quality. As the debate continues, it is essential that regulatory bodies, healthcare providers, and privacy advocates work together to develop a balanced approach that prioritizes both patient privacy and effective oversight. Ultimately, fostering a transparent, trusting, and safe healthcare environment is crucial to ensuring optimal patient care and outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The senate's ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators. This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consulta. These were officially \\"advice\\" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates. The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC, this practice became less prevalent, as the Roman Dictator, Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members. What governing Roman body would self-select their own members during times of great distress?","output":"During times of great distress or military emergency, the Roman Senate would self-select their own members. This practice was more prevalent in situations such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC, when the regular appointment process by Roman Censors or the selection by newly elected magistrates was not as commonly followed.

Q: The spike (S) protein of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) mediates both cell attachment by binding to its receptor hACE2 and membrane fusion during virus entry. We have previously identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and residues important for RBD-hACE2 association. Here, we further characterized the S protein by investigating the roles of the cytoplasmic tail and 19 residues located in the RBD in protein accumulation, receptor binding, and pseudotype virus entry. For these purposes, we first identified an entry-efficient S gene template from a pool of gene variants and used it as a backbone to generate a series of cytoplasmic tail deletion and single residue substitution mutants. Our results showed that: (i) deletion of 18 aa from the C-terminus enhanced the S protein accumulation and virus entry, which might be due to the deletion of intracellular retention signals; (ii) further deletion to residue 29 also enhanced the amount of S protein on the cell surface and in virion, but reduced virus entry by 25%, suggesting that residues 19-29 contributes to membrane fusion; (iii) a 29 aa-deletion mutant had a defect in anchoring on the plasma membrane, which led to a dramatic decrease of S protein in virion and virus entry; (iv) a total of 15 residues (Y498, V499, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, G575, S576, E582, W585, Y590, T591, V593 and G594) within RBD were important for receptor binding and virus entry.

(b). positive.","output":"Based on the content and overall tone of the review provided, it is apparent that this review is (a) negative. The reviewer was highly critical, expressing intense dissatisfaction with nearly every aspect of the movie they watched. They criticized the plot, the pace, and the acting, going so far as to state that it's the \\"worst movie\\" they've ever seen. They also expressed that they perceived the movie as a waste of time and recommended others not to watch it. These are all indicative of a generally unfavorable or negative review. In the evidence provided, they state \\"this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life,\\" which suggests extreme dissatisfaction, and therefore negative sentiment. They also say \\"all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie,\\" implying a lack of professionalism or high-quality production, another negative point. Another negative aspect identified is the lack of structure and organization in the movie, as per the statement \\"there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming.\\" They expressed discontentment with the pace too, saying \\"i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie.\\" The story of the movie was also seen as an issue, the reviewer called it \\"so fake,\\" again showing negativity given that successful films generally require a believable or engaging narrative. Lastly, the strongest indication that this feedback is negative, is when the reviewer states \\"if you're considering watching this movie, don't. you're just wasting your time.\\" This discouragement not only reveals the reviewer's negative sentiment, but also tries to deter potential viewers from watching the movie, which is indicative of a negative review overall.

Sentence 1: \\"Shortly after the birth of her daughter, George Jones, Tina adopted Georgette Tina and her sisters.\\"  This sentence mentions that George Jones is the daughter of Tina. Shortly after George Jones' birth, Tina adopted Georgette, Tina, and her sisters. Tina is mentioned twice, which makes the sentence a bit confusing. It is possible that this is an error and that the first \\"Tina\\" in the sentence was unintentionally mentioned when it should have been someone else.  2. Sentence 2: \\"Georgette adopted Tina and her sisters shortly after the birth of their Daughter George Jones.\\" In this sentence, Georgette is the one who adopted Tina and her sisters. The daughter, George Jones, belongs to Tina and her sisters. This implies that George Jones is the daughter of Tina's family (most likely one of Tina's sisters). These two sentences do not mean the same thing due to the different adoption dynamics (who adopts whom) and the parentage of George Jones.

Article:","output":"Title: Crafting with Precision: Ribbon Projects Made Simple As the world whooshes forward, fueled by technological advancements, engaging in traditional activities like crafting can serve as a soothing moment of respite. Crafting with ribbons is one such activity that combines creativity and pleasure to harvest beautiful pieces as the end product. The first critical step to undertake before you plunge into your crafting escapade is gathering all your supplies. This implies that you need to secure high-quality crafting ribbon, which is easily available in craft stores or online. Depending on the particular project you have in mind, you may also require scissors, a ruler or tape measure, and a hot glue gun or fabric adhesive. The significance of collecting every required supply cannot be overstated, as these tools form the foundation of your crafting journey. Having everything at your fingertips helps to streamline your crafting process, eliminates unnecessary interruptions, and ultimately, enhances your crafting experience. Once your supplies are ready and within reach, it is time to move on to one of the most critical steps in crafting – measurement. It is crucial here to measure the ribbon carefully. Getting the dimensions right at this stage saves you from the odd possibility of having either a surplus or shortage of the ribbon further down the line. Measurement also ensures proportionality and symmetry in the final product, attributes that add to its aesthetic appeal. Utilize the ruler or the tape measure to help achieve accurate measurements. It is better to err on the side of excess while cutting, as you can always trim down an overly long piece, but cannot do much about a short one. The third vital step involves holding the loop. This stage is where your project starts taking form. Carefully create the loop in your ribbon, grasizing it securely but gently. It's an art form to find the perfect balance, ensuring the loop doesn't lose its shape or crinkle during handling. Manipulating the ribbon into your desired form requires delicate hands and a fair amount of patience. Remember to perform this action slowly and steadily for seamless execution. The art of crafting with ribbons can be an opportunity to express your personality, to relax, and to create something beautiful. In an era where virtually everything is mechanized, this art form stands as a testament to the value of handmade crafts. So capture your tools, measure your ribbon, maintain and hold your loop. It is through these systematic steps that your crafting journey begins, and the potential for creativity unfolds in your hands. The process may be elementary, but the satisfaction arising from it is genuinely magnificent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In Asia, various aspects of Buddhism often receive government support, especially in countries where it is recognized as the state religion or holds a significant cultural influence. Some of these supported aspects include: 1. Religious institutions: Buddhist temples, shrines, and monasteries may receive financial assistance, land grants, and other forms of support from the government to maintain their operations and preserve religious heritage sites. 2. Education: Governments may provide funding and support for Buddhist educational institutions, such as schools, colleges, and universities that focus on Buddhist studies and the teachings of the Buddha. This support helps preserve and promote Buddhist philosophy and knowledge. 3. Cultural preservation: Governments in Asia may invest in the preservation and restoration of Buddhist art, architecture, and archaeological sites. This aids in conserving the cultural heritage and history of Buddhism in the region. 4. Religious festivals and events: Governments may sponsor or support Buddhist festivals, events, and ceremonies, which help promote national unity and preserve the traditional aspects of the faith. 5. Social welfare: In some countries, Buddhist organizations receive government support for their charitable activities, such as providing food, shelter, and care to the needy. This support helps address various social issues and contributes to the overall well-being of the community. In summary, government support for Buddhism in Asia can manifest in various ways, including financial assistance, land grants, and support for institutions, education, cultural preservation, religious events, and social welfare.

Can the creator of Harry Potter do the same for a grown-up audience? The British author will find out on September 27, when more than 2 million hardcover  copies of her first novel for adults hit bookstores in the UK and the US, along with the digital edition. Set in a little English town, The Casual Vacancy is about an election held after an unexpected death. Michael Pietsch, Rowling's US publisher, says the novel reminded him of Dickens \\"because of the humanity, the humor, the social concerns, the intensely real characters\\". No magic though, apparently: \\"This book isn't Harry Potter\\", says Pietsch. \\"It is a completely different concern\\". As with Harry Potter, there are no advance copies for the media, no early reviews. To date, the seven-book series has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, and it became one of the most successful movie franchises in July 21, 2007. Back then, fans could buy books at midnight parties hosted by bookstores. But recent years have seen a great challenge for brick-and-mortar  bookstores. People are still buying books, indeed more books than in 2007, according to figures released by the Association of American Publishers. But they are reading them in a new format --the e-book. The Harry Potter series just became available digitally for the first time in April. It will be different for The Casual Vacancy, with the publisher _ releasing an e-book. For Rowling fans who once queued up for Harry Potter, this means that instant satisfaction is now only a click away. Moving from children's books to adult literature is a big transition. Will Rowling's new book be successful? Arthur Levine, the US co-editor of the Harry Potter books, seems confident: \\"If you read or re-read the Harry Potter books, you can see that Rowling has all the strengths she needs for great success as a fiction writer -you have great characters, an involving plot, a sense of humor and great empathy\\".

Rail riders along the California coast and the Boston-Washington \\"Northeast Corridor\\" are set to reap much of the benefits from 2 billion that Florida policymakers had earlier rejected for high-speed rail development. The Obama administration on Monday announced the reallocated funding, part of its push to spur environmentally friendly transportation and modernize the nation's infrastructure that's supported partly by the 2009 economic stimulus package. Fifteen states and Amtrak will receive the money to back 22 high-speed intercity passenger rail projects. Among other things, the funds will be used to improve speed and service in the Northeast, add faster rail lines in the Midwest and help spur more efficient train service between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nearly 300 million will be spent to reduce major delays for trains coming in and out of Manhattan -- the nation's busiest passenger rail junction. Within the next four years, high-speed rail advocate Petra Todorovich estimated trains between New York and Philadelphia will routinely move at 160 mph because of a host of upgrades aimed at improving \\"train speeds, capacity and reliability.\\" While billed as new funding, the money actually is previously pledged funds being directed to new recipients. Soon after taking office, Florida Gov. Rick Scott cited expected cost overruns and long-term operating costs for his call to block federal funding for an 84-mile-long high-speed rail line that would link Tampa and Orlando. Days after the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that allowed the Republican government to reject the federal money, the U.S. Transportation Department opened up a process to solicit fresh bids from other states and entities. It is all part of the 53 billion that the White House has proposed spending over the next six years to promote high-speed rail -- an initiative facing a chilly reception in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. \\"President Obama and I made a commitment to improve and expand America's transportation system,\\" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement. These new investments \\"will continue our progress toward making this vision a reality.\\" Biden, a regular Amtrak commuter between his home state of Delaware and Washington during his 36 years in the Senate, is known as a leading supporter of federally supported rail travel. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, on hand at New York's Penn Station for the announcement, insisted the funds will \\"help states across the country create jobs, spur economic development and boost manufacturing in their communities.\\" Obama said in January's State of the Union address that he was setting a goal of giving 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. The stimulus act has provided about 10.1 billion toward Obama's goal so far, according to the Transportation Department. \\"By 2050, the United States will be home to 100 million additional people -- the equivalent of another California, Texas, New York and Florida combined,\\" LaHood noted. \\"We simply cannot build enough highways and airports to accommodate this growth.\\" Supporters insist the emphasis on faster rail transportation is a necessary investment in the country's economic competitiveness. Critics contend it's little more than a massive boondoggle that is contributing to skyrocketing federal deficits while providing few proven benefits over the long term. Scott's decision this winter to reject what eventually worked out to 2 billion in federal funding for the Orlando-to-Tampa plan surprised a number of observers. This came after the Obama administration pulled another 1.2 billion in funding from Ohio and Wisconsin after their newly elected GOP governors vowed to kill high-speed rail projects that were under way. LaHood portrayed those cases Monday as relatively rare exceptions, noting that the Transportation Department received 10 billion worth of requests for the 2 billion available. \\"Who says America does not have a pent-up demand?\\" he asked. Amtrak officials note that they set a new annual ridership record of more than 28 million passengers for the last fiscal year. Regardless, the new spending makes little sense at the current time, according to Sam Staley, an analyst at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian-oriented Los Angeles-based think tank. The administration \\"seems to be completely deaf to the real concerns about whether this is a well thought out program,\\" Staley told CNN. \\"There are so many other transportation needs that are going unfunded, including just bring existing transit systems up to a good state of repair.\\" \\"I don't see how anyone looking at the numbers can say that high-speed rail is going to be a primary driver of economic growth\\" in the regions targeted by the new money, Staley said. \\"What it will do is supplement the existing transportation network and serve a very targeted niche of that market. But it's not going to be a broad-based transportation solution.\\" Todorovich, the director of the urban planning initiative America 2050, said she believed critics would continue to target the rail initiative because it is \\"one of Obama's signature initiatives.\\" But she believes such efforts run counter to the needs and wants of policymakers and citizens nationwide who want such infrastructure projects to go forward -- even if that's not true in Florida. \\"(This) announcement helps to restore public confidence in the program, as we see that many states around the country are ready to put Florida's unwanted funding to use,\\" she said. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.

With POP3 support, Gmail users will be able to transfer their messages to a client-side e-mail application and store the messages on their local hard drives, making them accessible off-line. What is this text about?","output":"This text is discussing a feature of Gmail which supports the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3). POP3 is a standard email protocol that deals with the transmission and storage of email and it is used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. When the user is connected to the internet, the email client interacts with the server to download new emails to the user's local machine or device. In the context of Gmail, being one of the most popular web-based email services, this feature greatly enhances the flexibility and accessibility for its users. By using a POP3-supported email client application like Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Apple Mail, Gmail users can download and locally store their messages on their computer's hard drive rather than keeping them online on Gmail's server. This feature permits users to access, read, and manage these emails even when they are not connected to the internet.  Once the emails are downloaded and stored locally, actions such as moving the emails to different folders, deleting them, or marking them as read will not affect the online version of those emails in the Gmail server. This is because, by default, POP3 protocol doesn't synchronize these actions between the email client and the server.  However, it's important to note that users need to correctly configure their Gmail settings and the settings in their email client application to use the POP3 feature. If not properly set up, there is a risk of messages being permanently deleted from the server when they are downloaded to the local machine.   In summary, the text is about leveraging POP3 support on Gmail to enhance user convenience. It allows users to manage their email off-line by transferring messages from Gmail's servers to a client-side email application, thereby storing them on their local hard drives for offline access."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Ziziphus -  Ziziphus /ˈzɪzɨfəs/ is a genus of about 40 species of spiny shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical regions throughout the world.

Plot title: The Green Mile Movie plot: In a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999, Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat. His companion Elaine becomes concerned and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935, which took place when he was a prison officer, in charge of death row and the state's electric chair. In 1935, Paul supervises fellow officers Brutus \\"Brutal\\" Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary on what they refer to as the \\"Green Mile\\", Death Row. Paul is suffering from a severe bladder infection and receives John Coffey, a physically imposing but mentally challenged black man, into his custody. John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls. One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak but is beyond reproach; he is the nephew of Louisiana's First Lady, but only Paul is bold enough to defy this. He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard \\"Del\\" Delacroix; he breaks Del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles, which Del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head; Del's body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain. John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures Paul's bladder infection, resurrects Mr. Jingles, and heals Melinda Moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. This last affliction he releases into Percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer William Wharton, dead.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will postpone a test vote next week on a bill to fight online piracy and counterfeiting, after a storm of protest from Internet companies and search engines who fear overregulation and censorship.      The protests included a blackout by Wikipedia this week and a petition by Google that generated more than seven million signatures.      Now at least a half-dozen senators who sponsored the measure say they oppose it.      Reid says he's optimistic about reaching a compromise that protects Americans' intellectual property and maintains openness and innovation on the Internet. ||||| WASHINGTON—The push for antipiracy legislation brought lawmakers together for much of the past year, but in the Senate at least, the support that remains after nationwide protests appears to be mostly from Democrats.      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is moving ahead with plans for a test vote on the legislation Tuesday, but the Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, on Thursday called for a postponement, citing \\"serious issues with this legislation.\\"      At least 14 Republican senators announced their opposition to the legislation this week as thousands of Internet sites, including online encyclopedia Wikipedia, went dark Wednesday to protest the bills. Seven Democratic senators said they either had serious concerns or couldn't support the legislation in its current form, adding their voices to a handful of Democrats who had previously opposed the bill.      The House and Senate are considering similar legislation—known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, in the House—aimed at cracking down on foreign-based websites that offer pirated movies, music and other content. The bills have received strong backing from the Hollywood studios and unions, which say the pirated sites are costing both money and jobs..      Google Inc., eBay Inc. and other Internet companies say the legislation would harm the Web's open nature and could lead to more lawsuits against U.S. Internet sites that inadvertently host pirated content. Google said Thursday that over seven million people had signed its online protest petition.      The battle has scrambled the usual Washington lines. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and labor unions, usually rivals, back the bills, while many activist groups on both the left and the right oppose them.      For most Republicans, pressure from vocal opponents is adding up to a no vote, or at least a \\"not yet\\" position. Some worry that the enforcement that's authorized could hurt U.S. cybersecurity efforts.      It's a tougher call for some Democrats, thanks in part to the bill's strong union backing and the fact that Hollywood has opened its collective wallet wider for Democrats historically. The bill is a top priority of the Motion Picture Association of America, which hired veteran Democratic senator Chris Dodd as its chairman last year. Mr. Dodd is barred from lobbying former colleagues now, but he remains friends with many of them.      The legislation has been particularly tricky for California lawmakers trying to balance the needs of both Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein met with Google and Facebook Inc. and other bill opponents to explain her support. A spokesman said Thursday that she \\"recognizes the bill needs further changes.\\"      —Amy Schatz ||||| Hollywood's top lobbyist and former Sen. Chris Dodd is threatening to cut off campaign funds to President Obama's re-election effort because of anger over the White House appearing to side with tech companies in a bitter fight over anti-piracy legislation.      In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Dodd fired off a warning to Obama -- his former Senate Democratic colleague in this election year -- \\"don't take us for granted.\\"      \\"Candidly, those who count on quote 'Hollywood' for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake,\\" Dodd told Fox News. \\"Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.\\"      Dodd, who became CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America after leaving the Senate in 2011, noted the movie \\"Avatar\\" was stolen by online pirates 21 million times. Such acts, he said, threaten to decimate his industry.      \\"You can complain and say, well, actors make a lot of money and they don't have to worry about this,\\" said Dodd. \\"You tell that to that camera guy, you tell that to that makeup artist, you tell that to that truck driver out there who made, makes a living because they work in this industry.\\"      \\"Avatar\\" was made by 20th Century Fox which, like Fox News Channel, is owned by NewsCorp. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of NewsCorp, has also been outspoken in promoting two pieces of anti-piracy legislation, the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act, known respectively as \\"SOPA\\" and \\"PIPA,\\" to protect copyrighted material.      Tech companies like Google charge that such a crackdown would result in censorship. Dodd said he was caught off-guard when the White House released a written statement last Saturday sharing some of the tech community's concerns about the legislation.      \\"I would caution people don't make the assumption that because the quote 'Hollywood community' has been historically supportive of Democrats, which they have, don't make the false assumptions this year that because we did it in years past, we will do it this year,\\" said Dodd. \\"These issues before us -- this is the only issue that goes right to the heart of this industry.\\"      Vice President Biden, in Reno, Nev. on Thursday, said that he met with tech officials Wednesday night and was meeting Thursday evening with Hollywood studio chiefs to try and broker a legislation deal.      A White House official later told Fox News the vice president isn't brokering a deal, suggesting Biden misspoke.      White House Press Secretary Jay Carney earlier this week stressed the administration did not take sides last Saturday and is simply trying to find the right balance to come up with reform that both sides can live with.      \\"Our firm belief is that we need to do something about online piracy by foreign websites, but we need to do it in a way that does not impinge upon a free and open Internet,\\" Carney said.      Meanwhile, it's unclear if Dodd will follow through on the threats --- or whether it will matter. Hollywood has so far ponied up over 4.1 million to the Obama re-election campaign. That's already higher than the 3.7 million it gave him in the 2008 campaign, according to Opensecrets.org. Several months remain for more money to flow.      In addition, any lost Hollywood support could be made up with votes and dollars from the tech community, which is lobbying the issue just as aggressively.      Fox News has learned from Democratic sources that several tech company officials attended a fundraiser for the president in Washington last Friday, one day before the White House publicly expressed its concerns about the proposed legislation that angered Hollywood so much.      While the fundraising event itself was on the president's public schedule, details of who attended were not released by the White House last Friday. Fox News on Thursday asked the Obama campaign to release the names of attendees but so far that has not been done.      An Obama campaign official did confirm \\"the event included both supporters who work for technology companies and those who do not.\\"      The campaign official said there was no connection between Friday's fundraiser and Saturday's announcement on the legislation, and noted the president does not take money from federal lobbyists so none was in attendance at the fundraiser. Other company officials for some of the tech companies, however, were there.      The president's re-election team also notes it has a broad base of financial support, and does not seem to be sweating any potential cutoff of more money than it's already received from Hollywood.      \\"This campaign is fueled by donations from more than 1.3 million Americans who come from different backgrounds and might disagree on some issues but contribute to the campaign because they believe in the president's vision to restore economic security for the middle class and to build an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility,\\" said the Obama campaign official. ||||| The European Union's Internet czar on Friday added her voice to resistance to the Stop Online Piracy Act, in an unusually open comment on pending U.S. legislation.      \\"Glad tide is turning on SOPA: don't need bad legislation when should be safeguarding benefits of open net,\\" Neelie Kroes, the EU's Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, said in a Twitter message.      The piece of legislation, currently in the House of Representatives, would allow the U.S. Justice Department to target legitimate sites where users share pirated content.      Outrage over SOPA earlier this week triggered a one-day blackout by Wikipedia's English-language service and other popular websites and sparked growing scrutiny of the bill.      The EU is also working to tackle online piracy, but is trying hard to do so without restricting Internet freedom.      \\"Speeding is illegal too: but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway,\\" Kroes said in a second tweet.      The EU usually avoids openly criticizing pending legislation in the U.S, one of its biggest political allies and trading partners. But politicians on different sides of the Atlantic often don't see eye to eye when it comes to regulating the Internet.      The Commissioner's spokesman defended Kroes's comments, pointing to the widespread criticism of the bill.      \\"It shows that people do have very serious concerns about their access to the Internet and it shows that in addition to enforcement, which is very important, we need to be increasing the number of legal content offers that are available online,\\" Ryan Heath told reporters.      He added that the EU already has legislation in place to fight online piracy and is currently working on an overhaul of it's rules for intellectual property rights in an effort to make it easier to obtain the rights to distribute content online legally.      Kroes, one of the most outspoken commissioners who imposed massive fines against Microsoft during her time as the EU's antitrust regulator, has embraced new media.      Also on Friday, she asked her more than 32,000 followers on Twitter to comment on the shutdown of popular file-sharing site Megaupload.com on her department's Facebook page. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to postpone a test vote on a bill against online piracy and counterfeiting after protests from internet companies and search engines, who were concerned about overregulation and censorship.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Prince and Me Movie plot: The movie opens with med-student bound Paige Morgan receiving a birthday cake from her teachers and colleagues. She suddenly realizes she is late for something and hurries out of the school and drives home. She has no time to talk to her mother as she goes to her room, grabs a dress from her closet, and hops in her truck. Meanwhile, in the country of Denmark we see the young & rebellious Prince Edvard and his servant, Soren, meeting up with a young man for what seems to be a race of some sort. Back in America, Paige is driving to a friend's wedding; she arrives in her father's pick up and nearly runs over half of the wedding party. At the reception, she and a friend discuss the subject of romance and marriage, neither of which Paige has time for because of her focus on her career. The bouquet is tossed, and by some twist of fate, it lands right in Paige's lap. Back in Denmark, the race is about to start; the cars speed down the open road and Edvard wins the race, where he is greeted with a threesome involving two teenage girls. He then realizes that, like Paige, he is also late for something very important. At the castle, 12-year-old Princess Arabella is playing a Gameboy as Edvard's parents, King Haraald and Queen Rosalind, wait anxiously for their eldest child to arrive before they are shown in public. Edvard arrives and is greeted with a hug by Arabella, though his parents don't seem so happy. He takes Arabella's arm and they step out onto the balcony. Later, Edvard and King Haraald are to meet with some members of the board; Haraald warns his son to behave himself, and Edvard glumly agrees. As they enter the room to sit down Haraald gets a bit dizzy, but when asked if he is all right he insists that he is fine. The meeting goes on. Edvard could care less about business and politics and he intentionally flirts with one of the women present.

First question: What is the history of government? Second question: What is the history of the government of Nepal? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [I] no. [II] yes.","output":"To answer both questions, I will research and provide a brief overview of the histories. First question: What is the history of government? Step 1: Research the origins of government systems Justification: Understanding the beginnings of government systems will provide insight into their early development. Governments have existed in various forms throughout human history. The earliest known forms of government were tribal, where decision-making and leadership were shared among a small group of individuals. As societies grew more complex, so did their governments, with the emergence of city-states in ancient Sumer and Egypt. Step 2: Explore various government systems throughout history Justification: By examining different types of governments, we can better understand how they evolved over time. Some notable examples include the Greek city-states with their mixed forms of government, the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire, the Chinese dynastic rule, and the European feudal system. The modern nation-state emerged in the 17th century, and various systems like democracy, monarchy, and dictatorship continue to evolve today. Second question: What is the history of the government of Nepal? Step 1: Research the early history of Nepal's government Justification: Understanding the early stages of Nepal's government will provide a basis for its evolution. Nepal has a long history that can be traced back to the Kirat period (800 BCE - 300 CE), followed by the Licchavi period (300 - 750 CE) and the Malla period (1200 - 1769 CE). During these periods, various small kingdoms and principalities were governed by monarchs and local rulers. Step 2: Explore the unification of Nepal and the Shah Dynasty Justification: The unification of Nepal under the Shah Dynasty is a significant event in its governmental history. In the late 18th century, King Prithvi Narayan Shah unified the various kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Nepal. The Shah Dynasty ruled until 2008, during which time the government underwent significant changes. In 1990, pro-democracy movements led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy with a multi-party system. Step 3: Discuss the transition to a republic and the current government system Justification: The establishment of a republic marks another significant change in Nepal's governmental history. In 2008, following a decade-long Maoist insurgency, the monarchy was abolished, and Nepal was declared a federal democratic republic. The current government system in Nepal is a federal parliamentary republic, with power shared between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent.

Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell).

Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job. According to the above context, answer the following question. After this job description, do you think he went back to work for the company at some point in the future? Answer:","output":"Definitely not. Based on the given context, it is clear that the individual had a negative experience with the company they briefly worked for as a waiter. They had to go through an unpaid training period, referred to as an \\"audition,\\" which is not typical for waiters, and their efforts during this period were not compensated even after they left the job. Moreover, upon attempting to claim the wages they rightfully earned and threatening to contact the labor board, the company dismissed their claims, stating there was no record of their employment and denying any owed payment. Given the unfair treatment, lack of proper compensation, and overall negative experience described in this situation, it is highly unlikely that this person would ever go back to work for this company in the future. They have already moved on to another, better job, and there is no indication that they would reconsider working for a company that mistreated them and refused to pay for their services."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  What is an answer for this question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background information, we can conclude the following: Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells (gametes) and can be passed on to the next generation. Somatic mutations occur in body cells and cannot be passed on to the next generation. In the situation presented, Dan studied multicellular organisms with mutations. Group A had germline mutations, and Group B had somatic mutations. Now we can address the question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Since germline mutations involve mutations in the DNA of sex cells and Group A organisms presented with germline mutations, it means that Group A had more organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells. Therefore, Group B (with somatic mutations) had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He is haunted by memories of Paro, his childhood love, whom he could not marry due to a difference in social status. Feeling unsupported by his family, Devdas decides to take a week off work and go on a solitary journey to find himself and search for meaning in his life. While on the journey, Devdas takes inspiration from the movies he loves and imagines a train ride that would take him back to his past, where he comes across different people who have made an impact on his life. On this \\"Train of Memories\\": 1. Young Devdas - An energetic, but insecure boy, eager to impress Paro and explore life beyond his village. 2. Paro - Devdas' childhood love, who represents the pure, unadulterated love he lost due to societal pressures. 3. Chandramukhi - A courtesan and former lover of Devdas, who represents the temptation and the darker side that came into his life after being rejected by Paro. 4. Devdas' strict father - A symbol of the societal and familial pressures that hold Devdas back and force him into a life he never wanted. 5. Devdas' wise old grandmother - A kind, gentle woman who offers advice and understanding of life's complexities, helping Devdas make sense of his past decisions and current struggles. As the imaginary train ride continues, Devdas gets to interact with these significant people, reflecting on their impact on his life and understanding how he can move forward.

An investment banker found dead after trying to climb the Northeast's highest peak was using a broken emergency beacon and could have saved herself if she turned her cellphone on, rescuers have claimed. Kate Matrosova, 32, dropped off by her husband Charlie Farhoodi  at the base of New Hampshire's 5,400ft Mount Madison at 5am last Sunday. Within hours she had activated an emergency beacon amid but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard because mountaineers say the sub-zero temperatures prevented it from working properly. Her body was discovered 24 hours later, with emergency responders being sent in the wrong direction by the faulty technology. Others have said it was 'negligent' for her to be up there and her decisions showed her 'inexperience'. Tragic: BNP Paribas credit trader Kate Matrosova, 32, was found dead 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked up Mount Madison. Married: Matrosova was dropped off at the range at 5am on Sunday by husband Charlie Farhoodi (left) who is listed on LinkedIn as the Vice President of JP Morgan. The couple shared a 1 million apartment in Manhattan. Emergency: A search team was unable to locate Matrosova (pictured in January) for 24 hours after her call. When she activated the tracking device, it triggered an instantaneous alert at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. Operators called the number associated with account, but it went straight to voicemail because her phone was switched off. It meant no one dialed 911 until her husband, who was sitting in his hotel room at the time, was contacted by staff at the Florida base. Volunteer mountain rescuer Steve Larson told the Boston Globe if they had Mastrova's correct location they would not have spent hours trekking through the woodland in the wrong direction. 'One lesson in all this, for all of this whiz-bang technology, it obviously is not spot-on,' he said. Fish and Game Lieutenant Wayne Saunders said her beacon was designed to function in temperatures as low as minus 20. But he said the air was far colder, meaning it could have tricked the technology. Mike Pelchat, a states park employee, added: 'Maybe she relied a little too much on the technology. Maybe she thought she could turn back. But the temperatures, and the wind, got the best of her.' Max Lurie, 28, who responded to the second Mountain Rescue Service call, told the Globe: 'It was cold — one of the coldest nights of the year — and the wind was howling. I don’t go up there when there are conditions like that. 'It was negligent for her to be up there. Her decision clearly speaks to her inexperience.' Grueling: Mt Madison (pictured, not with Matrosova) was hit by 100 mph winds and a blizzard on Sunday night. She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet. Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a 1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of  Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim. As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F. The BNP Paribas credit trader  sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon. After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back. 'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV. Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range. She was found between Mt Madison and Mt Adams (top right), believed to have died from exposure to the cold. Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own. Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams. A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area. 'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.' It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006. Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser. In 2012, she attended Harvard University Extension School to study Numerical Analysis before obtaining a masters in financial engineering from the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 2013. Vice President: Widower Charlie Farhoodi's job on LinkedIn is listed as Vice President of JP Morgan. Tribute: This picture was posted on Facebook in tribute to Matrosova with a friend called her 'a vibrant spirit' After interning for a year at BNP Paribas, she accepted the role of Credit Trading Associate in August 2014. Based on Facebook pictures, she appeared to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. Her interests are listed on LinkedIn as mountain climbing, judo and scuba diving. Friends and relatives paid tribute to Matrosova online, posting pictures of the 32-year-old. One wrote: 'Rest in peace...' with a photograph of Matrosova hiking through sunlight snowy woodland. Another described her as 'a vibrant spirit'. A blizzard watch was issued for coastal New England over the weekend that touched on the edge of the White Mountain National Forest, which encompasses the Presidential Range. The region saw up to 14 inches of snow in some areas. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Kate Matrosova, a 32-year-old investment banker, was found dead after attempting to climb the Northeast's highest peak, Mount Madison, in New Hampshire.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending, the task is to generate the counterfactual context that is aligned with the new ending. Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story. Problem:Premise: Tim was out on a hike in the desert.   Initial Context: He ran into a rattlesnake.   Original Ending: Tim got bit before he knew it. He called 911 and asked for help. They were able to give him antivenom.   New ending: Tim got dehydrated before he knew it. He called 911 and asked for help. They were able to give him water.  Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identifying the premise given in the problem Usage: \\"Tim was out on a hike in the desert.\\"  Explanation: This is the first sentence of the story, and it sets the overall theme and location for the story, which is Tim hiking in the desert. Part #2: Analyzing the initial context and original ending Usage: Initial Context - \\"He ran into a rattlesnake.\\"               Original Ending - \\"Tim got bit before he knew it. He called 911 and asked for help. They were able to give him antivenom.\\" Explanation: The initial context gives us more information about the story's plot, i.e., Tim encounters a rattlesnake, and the original ending tells us how he gets bitten and receives antivenom treatment. Part #3: Identifying the new ending given in the problem Usage: \\"Tim got dehydrated before he knew it. He called 911 and asked for help. They were able to give him water.\\" Explanation: The new ending provides an alternative conclusion to the story, focusing on Tim getting dehydrated and needing water instead of the antivenom for the snake bite. Part #4: Creating the counterfactual context based on the premise and new ending Usage: \\"He became thirsty but didn't have enough water.\\" Explanation: This counterfactual context slightly modifies the initial context to align with the new ending. Instead of running into a rattlesnake, Tim becomes thirsty and doesn't have enough water, leading to dehydration and the need for help and water provided in the new ending."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Sweating reduces body heat.

Normally the answer to this question would be anyone around you who you find truly inspiring. It could also be someone like J. K. Rowling or Martin Luther King Jr. who have proven to be strong and intelligent people. However, in today's world, stars are regarded as role models along with the heroes listed above, despite their intentions or actions. Teens attempt to imitate their actions for two major reasons. First, to be fashionable and accepted by popular culture, and second>>because stars' actions are so well documented by the media that it seems to grab our attention and turns it to following stars' lives. Much of the reports about stars is shocking and exhibits bad morals or lifestyles that aren't right for teenagers. In addition, almost everything stars do is described beyond truth to make a shocking story by taking it to the next level. However, teens must take responsibility for their actions. We can't always blame stars for influencing us. Only you have control over yourself and only you choose to do something. Our bodies and actions are in the hands of no one else. Now, who ever said stars are role models? Whether they choose to be or not, stars set examples as soon as they step into the spotlight. With reporters following and recording every move they make, it is impossible not to be watched and then be imitated. These people influence, teens whether or not they want to. Why should someone who doesn't want to be setting an example set one? So,should we look up to them or to people who are true and good role models?

A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key points The question asks 'What can we learn?' and the answer tells us 'The airport is closed'. This implies that the conversation must centre around the closure of an airport.  Step 2: Develop context To build a logical conversation, I'll first imagine a setting where such a discussion could happen. A scenario could be someone who needs to travel or an individual working in a job related to airline/airport services.  Step 3: Construct characters and relationships Next, let's construct two characters. For instance, one could be a person who is planning to travel and the other might be a travel agent. Their relationship could be a business one. Step 4: Formulate the conversation Now, let's write the conversation. The traveler might inquire about flight availability, and the travel agent will relate the closure of the airport. Since we want 'The airport is closed' to be what we learn, that has to be the key point of the conversation. Here is a conversation that fulfills the given requirements: Traveler: \\"Hi, I'm planning a trip to Los Angeles for the weekend. Can you check for any available flights?\\" Travel Agent: \\"I'm sorry, but due to adverse weather conditions, Los Angeles airport is closed until further notice.\\" Traveler: \\"Oh, that's unfortunate!

Die Europäische Union (EU) spielt eine zentrale Rolle in der heutigen Zeit, insbesondere in Bezug auf ihre Fähigkeit, Solidarität und Unterstützung für ihre Mitgliedstaaten bereitzustellen. Diese Unterstützung erfolgt insbesondere in Form von Finanzinstrumenten und Strukturfonds, die zur Förderung der wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und territorialen Zusammenarbeit in Europa beitragen. Ein solches Instrument ist der Solidaritätsfonds der EU, der Mitteleuropa dabei unterstützen soll, auf Naturkatastrophen und große Krisensituationen zu reagieren. Dieser Fonds kann beispielsweise zur Unterstützung von Ländern eingesetzt werden, die von Überschwemmungen, Erdbeben oder schweren Industrieunfällen betroffen sind. Die Strukturfonds hingegen sind ein zentrales Element der EU-Regionalpolitik. Sie bestehen aus dem Europäischen Fonds für regionale Entwicklung (EFRE) und dem Europäischen Sozialfonds (ESF). Der EFRE zielt darauf ab, die wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen Europas zu verringern, indem er in Projekte investiert, die Wachstum, Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Arbeitsplätze fördern. Der ESF hingegen konzentriert sich auf die Verbesserung der Beschäftigungsfähigkeit der Bürgerinnen und Bürger Europas und die Förderung sozialer Integration und Chancengleichheit.

Mark Twain one said, \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\" Well I tried, and after about 75 pages, I had to put this book down. The reason? A curious writing style more attuned to an historical novel than serious history. And although some may appreciate this style, I found it longwinded and short on substance. Additionally, the course of the war, in general, is difficult to follow because it is told via interconnected vignettes as seen by lower ranking GIs; there are no references (and many times no attribution at all) as to where the author gained his information or how they fit into the bigger picture.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Options: - desk drawer - purse - bank - keep accounts - keep track of emails  Explain why a human would choose \\"bank\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"bank\\" to answer the question above because an account book is a financial record used to keep track of transactions such as income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Banks are financial institutions that primarily deal with these types of transactions. They offer services like managing accounts, providing loans, and facilitating investments. In banks, account books are essential for maintaining accurate records of all financial transactions taking place.  While the other options might have some relation to an account book, they do not provide a clear connection to the purpose of the account book itself: - Desk drawer: an account book may be stored in a desk drawer, but the drawer itself does not use or maintain the account book. - Purse: similar to the desk drawer, an account book might be stored in a purse, but it is not where the account book is used or maintained. - Keep accounts: this phrase refers to the action of maintaining financial records, but it doesn't specify an institution or entity that would use an account book for this purpose. - Keep track of emails: while this is an organizational activity, it is unrelated to financial records and the use of an account book. Emails can be extremely helpful in keeping track of correspondence and document attachments, but they are not directly related to financial transactions.

Who led the Iceni against the Romans","output":"Boudica, also known as Boudicca or Boadicea, was the queen who led the Iceni tribe against the Romans in a significant uprising in 60 or 61 AD. The Iceni were a Celtic tribe that inhabited the area of modern-day Norfolk, eastern Cambridgeshire, and northern Suffolk in England during the late Iron Age and early Roman Britain. Boudica was married to Prasutagus, the king of the Iceni. Prasutagus had maintained a cooperative relationship with the Roman Empire during his rule, seeking to preserve Iceni independence by becoming a client-king under Emperor Nero's reign. This relationship allowed the Iceni tribe to enjoy a certain degree of autonomy while still being part of the Roman Empire. When Prasutagus died around 60 AD, he left a will that bequeathed half of his kingdom to his daughters, while the other half was intended for the Roman Emperor Nero to maintain this alliance. However, the Romans disregarded Prasutagus' will and instead chose to annex the entire Iceni kingdom, treating it as conquered territory. They confiscated the property of the Iceni elite, subjected Boudica to a brutal flogging, and allowed her daughters to be raped. These violent acts provoked Boudica and the Iceni people to rise in rebellion against Roman rule. Boudica, being a charismatic and courageous leader, amassed a sizeable force by allying with other tribes, notably the Trinovantes, who also harbored resentment toward the Romans. Together, they launched a violent revolt against the Roman occupation in Britain. The insurgents targeted the Roman settlements of Camulodunum (now Colchester), Londinium (now London), and Verulamium (now St. Albans), burning and razing them to the ground. It's estimated that over 70,000 Roman citizens and allies were killed during the revolt. Roman Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, who was campaigning in present-day Wales at the time, quickly gathered and led a considerably smaller Roman force against Boudica's army. Despite being outnumbered, they were able to achieve a decisive victory in an unnamed battle, now known as the Battle of Watling Street, owing to their superior military tactics, discipline, and organization. Boudica's army suffered heavy casualties, effectively ending the rebellion. Following the defeat, Boudica allegedly poisoned herself to avoid capture and humiliation by the Romans. The details of her death remain uncertain, as various ancient sources offer different accounts. Nonetheless, the story of Boudica and her rebellion remains an iconic symbol of resistance and defiance against the powerful Roman Empire, and she is still celebrated today as a British national heroine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"A man stands on a ladder doing some sort of work while he slowly gains public attention.\\", is the sentence \\"The man is sitting on a chair.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Based on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A man stands on a ladder doing some sort of work while he slowly gains public attention,\\" the sentence \\"The man is sitting on a chair.\\" cannot be considered a true statement. The reason for this is that there is a clear discrepancy between the positioning of the man in both sentences. In the original sentence, the man is described as standing on a ladder while performing some kind of work. This suggests that he is elevated and actively engaging in a task. Additionally, the fact that he gradually garners public attention might imply that his work is either noticeable or intriguing to those around him. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the man is sitting on a chair. \\"Sitting\\" denotes a different posture from \\"standing\\" and implies a more static or inactive position compared to the original scenario. Moreover, the mention of a chair as opposed to a ladder changes the context and location in which the man is found. A chair is typically used for resting or sitting tasks, while a ladder serves as a tool for ascending and reaching higher spaces. It is important to note that both sentences are not mutually exclusive in a broader context. For instance, the man could be initially standing on the ladder and then later switch to sitting on a chair after completing his work. However, when examined solely based on the information provided in each individual sentence, they describe vastly differing situations. To concur, the sentence \\"The man is sitting on a chair.\\" cannot be regarded as a true statement when referring to the specific scenario described in the original sentence. The change in the man's position, the tool he is using, and the potential nature of his activity contributes to this conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

Context: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. Question: Why was the daughter devestated?

Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: \\"He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me.\\" Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans' music video \\"Aankhon Mein\\", the producer Ramesh Taurani was keen to cast him in a film. However, upon meeting him, Taurani thought Kapoor, who was 20 years old at the time, to be too young and underweight to become an actor, and encouraged him to wait for a few years. Kapoor, meanwhile, turned down a lead role in N. Chandra's sex comedy Style in hopes of working with Taurani. Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance Ishq Vishk (2003), which Ken Ghosh was directing for his company. Kapoor, who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build, was eventually hired. Before beginning work on the film, he attended acting workshops with Naseeruddin Shah and Satyadev Dubey.  Ishq Vishk tells the story of Rajiv Mathur (Kapoor), a high-school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities (played by Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywala). Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films. Writing for The Hindu, the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be \\"hero material\\", adding that \\"boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face - but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department.\\" The film, however, proved to be a sleeper hit at the box office and won Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.  Following his debut, Kapoor reunited with Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk. The thriller Fida (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman (Kareena Kapoor) and her lover (Fardeen Khan) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor \\"shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy, who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies.\\" Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil Maange More in which he was paired opposite three women: Soha Ali Khan, Tulip Joshi, and Ayesha Takia. Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan's acting style. Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful.  The series of poorly received films continued in 2005, when all three of Kapoor's films failed at the box office. His first two releases that year were the comedies Deewane Huye Paagal and Vaah! Life Ho Toh Aisi!, both of which were largely panned. The former was plagiarised from the Hollywood film There's Something About Mary in which Kapoor played one of Rimi Sen's love interests; the critic Khalid Mohamed found Kapoor to be \\"the only likeable element in this travesty\\" but Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled him \\"colourless\\" and criticised his pairing with Sen. His final role was that of a righteous teenager drawn towards a life of indulgence in John Matthew Matthan's drama Shikhar, co-starring Ajay Devgan, Bipasha Basu and Amrita Rao. The critic Sukanya Verma found Kapoor to be miscast as a village boy in the film, but noted that he was \\"never short of spontaneity and youthful exuberance\\". So, was there another movie?","output":"Yes, Shahid Kapoor's career continued after 2005, and he went on to act in numerous movies. In 2006, he starred in the romantic drama \\"Vivah,\\" directed by Sooraj R. Barjatya, which became one of his major commercial successes. He played the role of Prem, who follows the Indian tradition of arranged marriage. The film received positive reviews, and Kapoor's performance was well-received. Kapoor continued working in various films throughout the years, including notable roles in \\"Jab We Met\\" (2007), \\"Kaminey\\" (2009), \\"Haider\\" (2014), \\"Udta Punjab\\" (2016), and \\"Kabir Singh\\" (2019).

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was developed by the federal government as a segregated community? ?  The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

When she arrived she realized it was too good to be true. There were red solo cups everywhere, Toby lived in a frat house. Can we infer the following? Toby only drinks alcohol out of red solo cups.","output":"While it may be tempting to make such an inference, it would be too hasty to definitively conclude that Toby only drinks alcohol out of red solo cups based solely on the fact that Erin found a lot of red solo cups in his frat house when she went back to his place after their blind date. Here's a more detailed analysis of the situation that can help us understand the factors and reasons that lead to this conclusion. 1. Situational context: Toby and Erin's date location –a frat house– might suggest that the abundance of red solo cups could be related to its typical usage in popular party games like beer pong or flip cup. This implies that their widespread presence in such a setting could just be an indication of the house's inhabitants participating in these games or hosting parties where they play these games regularly. Toby may choose to drink alcohol from red solo cups when he takes part in such activities, but it doesn't confirm that this is his only mode of alcohol consumption. 2. Association with other people: Since Toby lives in a frat house, it's important to consider that he shares the living space with several other individuals. As a result, the abundance of red solo cups could be attributed to other residents hosting parties and events where alcohol is served in red solo cups, and it might not necessarily be a reflection of Toby's specific drinking preference. 3. Red solo cups' other potential uses: Red solo cups are not just used for drinking alcohol; they might also be utilized for non-alcoholic beverages or even as containers for snacks in casual settings. Therefore, the presence of numerous red solo cups throughout the house may not directly imply that Toby uses them primarily for alcohol. 4. Limited information: Our knowledge of Toby is limited to his blind date with Erin and the fact that he lives in a frat house with many red solo cups. Drawing a firm conclusion about his drinking preferences from this narrow set of observations would be premature. 5. Openness to alternatives: Toby being the full package, as described by Erin, might imply that he has a diverse set of interests and tastes. This means he might be open to using different types of cups or glassware for his alcoholic beverages depending on the situation or event. In summary, while it's possible that Toby might frequently use red solo cups for alcohol in specific contexts such as parties or games, it would be an overgeneralization to conclude that he only drinks alcohol out of red solo cups in every situation. We must consider the broader context in which the red cups were found, Toby's shared living situation, and the possibility of alternative usage scenarios before making such an inference. Further information and observations would be needed to arrive at a more accurate and well-supported understanding of Toby's preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  A giant walrus  for the following movie plot:  Sinbad (Patrick Wayne), sailor and Prince of Baghdad, moors at Charak, intent on seeking permission from Prince Kassim to marry Kassim's sister, Princess Farah (Jane Seymour). He quickly gets used to the city and its people, but finds it under curfew. When he shelters in a nearby tent, a witch (whom the audience later learns is Zenobia) summons a trio of ghouls, which emerge from a fire. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls. Meanwhile, Farah and Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), turn Kassim into a baboon (one of Harryhausen's stop-motion creations) just as he was going to be crowned caliph. If Kassim cannot regain his human form within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will be caliph instead. Sinbad meets with Farah, who believes Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells. Sinbad, Farah, and the baboon Kassim set off to find the old Greek alchemist named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), a hermit of on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break the spell. Zenobia and her son, Rafi (Kurt Christian), follow in a boat propelled by the robotic bronze Minoton, a magical creature created by the sorceress which looks like a Minotaur. During the voyage, Farah proves to be the only person capable of calming the baboon. Sinbad is convinced that the baboon is Kassim after he witnesses it playing chess with Farah. Sinbad and Farah land at Casgar and find Melanthius and his daughter Dione (Taryn Power), who agree to help them. Melanthius says they must travel to the land of Hyperborea where the ancient civilization of the Arimaspi once existed. On the way to Hyperborea, Melanthius and Dione also become convinced that the baboon is Kassim. Zenobia uses a potion to transform herself into a gull to spy on Sinbad. Once aboard his ship, she turns into a miniature human and listens in as Melanthius tells Sinbad how to cure Kassim. Alerted by Kassim, Melanthius and Sinbad capture Zenobia. Unfortunately, her potion spills and a wasp ingests some of it. The wasp grows to enormous size and attacks the two...

Which state had more people inhaling organic chemicals from the wildfire smoke?  Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return.  Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","output":"Washington state had more people inhaling organic chemicals from the wildfire smoke. Since the paragraph mentions that Washington state had many wildfires year-round, while Oregon had almost no wildfires, it is logical to infer that the exposure to wildfire smoke and its components, including organic chemicals, would be higher in Washington state. This higher exposure would result in a larger number of people inhaling organic chemicals in Washington compared to Oregon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied?

I lost my hairless dumbo rattie suddenly a few months ago. He was very young still  Predict the sentiment of this tweet. Available options: [+] negative [+] positive","output":"Based on an analysis of the content, emotions, and words used in the tweet, it appears to be predominantly negative in sentiment. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. The use of the word \\"loss\\": This word automatically indicates that someone or something has been lost, which commonly brings about negative emotions. In the context of this tweet, the user @alteredattic seems to have experienced the loss of a pet or a loved one. As a result, sadness and grief are likely to be the dominant emotions felt by the user and evoked in others. 2. The phrase \\"I lost my hairless dumbo rattie\\": This statement specifies the source of the loss, which is the user's beloved pet. Losing a pet can be a deeply emotional and painful experience for animal lovers, as pets often become cherished family members. Thus, this statement contributes to the overall negative sentiment of the tweet. 3. The word \\"suddenly\\": The fact that the loss happened suddenly implies that it was unexpected and, therefore, more shocking to the user. The lack of time for emotional preparation or anticipation of the loss exacerbates the associated negative feelings. 4. The mention of \\"a few months ago\\": This reference to the passage of time may suggest that the user is still mourning the loss of their pet. While the tweet may not be strictly negative in expressing these feelings, it is evident that the grief and sadness it evokes carry significant emotional weight. 5. The statement \\"He was very young still\\": By emphasizing that the pet was still young at the time of its passing, the user highlights the apparent unfairness of the situation and the potential life experiences they were denied. This acknowledgment adds an additional layer of negative sentiment to the tweet. Considering these factors, the sentiment of the tweet can be classified as negative. However, it is important to note that the user is also reaching out to another person (@alteredattic) in an empathetic manner, creating a sense of connection and shared experience. While this element does not necessarily make the tweet positive, it does demonstrate that emotions can be complex, and people often communicate to support one another during difficult times."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What year did the football team inthe most educated, highest-income, and fourth largest combined statistical area in the United States join the Big Ten Conference?

Information:  - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.  - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures).  - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.  - In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons and/or protons). The difference in mass between the products and reactants is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \\"binding energy\\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \\"main sequence\\" stars, or other high magnitude stars.  - Neutron radiation is a kind of ionizing radiation which consists of free neutrons. A result of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion, it consists of the release of free neutrons from atoms, and these free neutrons react with nuclei of other atoms to form new isotopes, which, in turn, may produce radiation.  - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.  - The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is  (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:  - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table.  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - Embrittlement is a loss of ductility of a material, making it brittle. Various materials have different mechanisms of embrittlement.  - Neutron - induced swelling is the increase of volume and decrease of density of materials subjected to intense neutron radiation . Neutrons impacting the material 's lattice rearrange its atoms , causing buildup of dislocations , voids , and Wigner energy . Together with the resulting strength reduction and embrittlement , it is a major concern for materials for nuclear reactors . Materials show significant differences in their swelling resistance .

Article: The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. \\"It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility,\\" a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make \\"land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land\\". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming \\"carbon neutral\\" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from \\"green\\" sources. Question: Which of the following is NOT Nasheed's idea?  _ Answer:  1). To purchase land elsewhere in the world to help Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. 2).

Given the question: Given the below context:  The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario can be categorized as indirectly impacting a step of the process.  To elaborate, if the power station orders more coal to be delivered, there will be an increased demand for coal production and transportation. Consequently, the steps involved in the coal extraction and supply process must also be adjusted to accommodate this increase in demand.  In this context, the actual steps of the process, which include excavating the mine, miners removing the coal, and transporting the coal to the surface, remain unchanged. However, the indirect impact of an increased coal order would potentially lead to adjustments in the efficiency, speed, or capacity of coal removal and transportation activities. For instance, the mine may employ additional miners or require them to work longer shifts in order to extract more coal from the mine. Additionally, there might be a need for more trucks or larger vehicles to transport the extra coal to the power station. Thus, the perturbation due to the increase in the power station's coal order doesn't directly change any specific step in the process but rather creates an indirect effect that influences the amount of coal loaded and the resources needed to accomplish the task.

Write the answer: On which of the Greek islands did Bacchus find Ariadne, according to legend?","output":"According to ancient Greek myth, Bacchus, the god of wine and revelry, found Ariadne on the island of Naxos. To understand the story, we need to delve into the backgrounds of both characters and provide context on the events leading up to their encounter. Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and Queen Pasiphae. Her role in Greek mythology becomes significant during the tale of Theseus and the Minotaur. The Minotaur, a half-human, half-bull creature, was the progeny of Pasiphae and a bull, born as a result of King Minos' disobedience to the gods. To contain the Minotaur, King Minos ordered the construction of a labyrinth under his palace. Every seven years, Athens was forced to send seven young men and seven young women as a tribute to King Minos. Selected Athenians were to be placed in the labyrinth as a sacrifice to the Minotaur. However, the hero Theseus, son of King Aegeus of Athens, was determined to end this practice. He volunteered as one of the seven young men and traveled to Crete with the intention of killing the Minotaur. Upon his arrival, Ariadne fell in love with Theseus and decided to help him defeat the Minotaur. She provided him with a ball of thread, allowing him to retrace his steps and navigate through the labyrinth. With her assistance, Theseus was successful in his quest to slay the Minotaur and save the other Athenians. Eager to escape Crete together, Theseus and Ariadne set sail, with the intention of returning to Athens. However, they stopped to rest on the island of Naxos. Legend has it that Theseus either intentionally or accidentally left Ariadne behind on Naxos, depending on the version of the myth. Some accounts suggest that Athena, the goddess of wisdom, visited Theseus in a dream and instructed him to abandon Ariadne, while other versions propose that Theseus simply grew tired of her. Regardless of the reason, Ariadne found herself abandoned and heartbroken on the island of Naxos. It was here that the god Bacchus discovered her. Bacchus, known as Dionysus in Greek mythology, was the god of wine, agriculture, fertility, and revelry. Upon encountering Ariadne, he was smitten by her beauty and grace. The two fell in love, and together they celebrated with festivities and generous libations. Bacchus then took Ariadne as his wife. As a wedding gift, he presented her with a beautiful crown made of seven stars known as Corona Borealis. This constellation can still be seen in the night sky to this day. In conclusion, according to Greek legend, Bacchus found Ariadne on the island of Naxos after her abandonment by the Athenian hero Theseus. The tale of Ariadne's encounter with Bacchus speaks to the transformative power of love and the capacity for second chances in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Fun quizzes and tests can be a great way to do something a little bit different in the classroom, while still learning and teaching. To make the whole exercise a success, it's important that you don't overlook the evaluation and debriefing at the end of the test. This helps the students to appreciate the purpose of the game and what they learned. You can start this by recapping some of the key points covered in test and writing them on the board. You might like to try grading the tests either in small groups or as a class. If you have done the quiz in small groups in class you can swap answers with another group, so that each team marks another team's test. If different groups have different answers to a question, you can use this as an opportunity to discuss it as a class.  Discussing the question in detail with the different answer will enable you to help make sure that everyone understands which answer was correct and why. Encourage the group that got the question wrong to talk together to explain where they went wrong.  This can operate as a kind of simple peer assessment, where students mark each other's work. This can be very positive, but you should make sure everyone stays friendly and nobody is singled out. If you are doing a fast-paced quiz in class, you can make grading part of the game. If you have given your students buzzers or bells to answer questions, you can write up the scores on the board and update them after each question. This will make it more like a quiz show.  You could have a simple tally chart on the board, or you could have something more creative. Each correct score could reveal a letter or part of a picture that the teams have to uncover to win. It might be a fun test at the end of the term to revise some key material while letting off a bit of steam, or it could be a more serious test that counts towards the overall grade. Whichever way you choose to do the test, make sure that you are clear about it.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of using fun quizzes and tests in the classroom as a different approach to learning and teaching.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person David encouraged to write more songs for the band?  Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...

Choose your answer from: A. tube nucleus; B. pollen tube; C. cytoplasm; D. intine; Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Each pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the intine (Figure 32.7). The exine contains sporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells. Sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage. Female Gametophyte (The Embryo Sac) While the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases. First, in the process of megasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploid megasporangium—an area of tissue in the ovules—undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase, megagametogenesis, the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei—the polar nuclei—move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid central cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells, which later degenerate. The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells (Figure 32.8). The synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. Once fertilization is complete, the resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed.

Experts estimate  that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities  at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said.

The statement implies that the performance exceeded the writer's expectations, especially since they mentioned they were never a Heath Ledger fan initially. The writer's appreciation for Heath's Joker could be attributed to a number of factors such as the depth and complexity Ledger brought to the character, the powerful screen presence he had, or his ability to infuse the role with a unique blend of menace, humor, and intelligence. Furthermore, the writer may have felt that Ledger's performance elevated the film, making it more enjoyable and engaging even when they found some of the action scenes overly exaggerated or hard to follow.

Q: Passage: Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given strings: A = \\"RIWqLkXZp\\" B = \\"iMqLkvc\\" 1. Initialize an empty matrix of size 10 x 8 (as len(A)=9 and len(B)=7) and fill all elements with 0. 2. Create variables maxLength (current maximum length of the common substring) and endIndex (ending index of the maxLength substring in A). 3. Iterate through both strings, comparing characters one by one. For better understanding, let's see the matrix after the comparisons:     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0     0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. While iterating, we find that maxLength = 4 (longest common substring length) and endIndex = 8 (the ending index of the maxLength substring in A). 5. Using maxLength and endIndex, we can extract the longest common substring from string A as: A[endIndex - maxLength + 1 : endIndex + 1] which would be A[5:9] = \\"LkXZ\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the bleeding stopped quickly after the sneeze, then you can call your veterinary office, discuss the issue, and make an appointment to bring your dog in. If the bleeding has not stopped or took a long time to stop, then the dog should be taken to a veterinarian immediately, as the blood loss alone can be a threat to your dog's health. If your regular veterinary office is closed while your dog's nose is bleeding, then you should take your dog to an emergency pet hospital in your area. If your dog's nose stopped bleeding shortly after the sneeze, call the emergency pet hospital and discuss whether to bring the dog in or to wait until the dog's normal veterinary office is open. In order to get a diagnosis, your veterinarian will need to do a variety of tests on your dog. These tests, which may require several rounds of testing, will allow your vet to narrow in on the cause of the bleeding. Possible tests your vet will want to perform include:  Blood cell count Urinalysis X-rays Rhinoscopy  Blood pressure Cultures from nose Additional specialized testing There are a variety of things that could be causing your dog's nose to bleed. Once your veterinarian gives you a definitive diagnosis, they should also present you with a treatment plan.  Your dog's bloody nose could have simply been caused by the force of your dog sneezing or by a foreign body in the nose. If this is the case your dog should easily recover on its own once any foreign bodies are removed. However, this may not be the case if there is an underlying problem with the dog's blood clotting ability. Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by a simple sinus infection. A sinus infection is usually treated with a round of antibiotics and can be cleared up quickly.  Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by a tumor. Treatment for a malignant tumor usually includes surgery and chemotherapy, although these treatments can be difficult for tumors in the sinuses.  Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by an infection in its teeth that traveled up into its sinus cavity. If the dog's teeth are infected, your dog will need to go to a veterinary dentist and have its dental infection treated. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something, like a story or an article. So, for this article, the summary is: If your dog's nose is bleeding, you should take it to the veterinarian or call for help. The vet will do some tests to find out why your dog's nose is bleeding.

As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Choose your answer from: (i). yes (ii). it is not possible to tell (iii). no","output":"Based on the provided premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The writing was extremely crass\\" is likely true. The phrase \\"Other no story line, cheap puns, and heavy-handed sexual innuendo\\" suggests that the writing in question lacked a coherent narrative structure and relied on lowbrow humor and overtly sexual content. These elements often contribute to a perception of crassness in a piece of writing.  Crassness can be understood as a lack of refinement, subtlety, or sensitivity in expression. A crass work might be characterized by its appeal to the baser instincts of the audience, often relying on crude humor, excessive violence, or explicit sexual content to hold their attention. In the case of the premise provided, a lack of story line indicates poor narrative structure, and the emphasis on cheap puns and sexual innuendo suggests that the writing relied heavily on unrefined and tasteless humor. However, it is essential to consider the possibility that the explicit content and cheap humor could be deliberately employed as a form of satire, subversion, or parody of a specific genre or societal norms. In such cases, distinguishing between crassness and intended artistic choice might require additional context or a deeper analysis of the work as a whole.

Read the given story carefully and identify the main events related to the location of the object (green_pepper) and the characters' (James and Charlotte) actions and beliefs. 2. Identify the scenario that the story falls into: a) the individual's belief matches reality, b) the individual's belief does not match reality, or c) an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. 3. Single out the distractor sentences that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader. 4. Analyze the question to determine what it is asking about - in this case, it asks about James' thoughts on where Charlotte would search for the green_pepper. 5. Combine the information gathered in steps 2 and 4 using the story's context to provide an accurate answer. In this particular story: - James and Charlotte both enter the sunroom. - The green_pepper is initially in the green_treasure_chest. - Charlotte exits the sunroom. - James moves the green_pepper to the red_bucket. - James exits the sunroom. - Charlotte enters the sunroom again. The provided question is: \\"Where does James think that Charlotte searches for the green_pepper?\\" Following the story's events, the scenario is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. In this case, James might have a false belief about where Charlotte would search for the green_pepper. As Charlotte was not in the sunroom when James moved the green_pepper to the red_bucket, James would likely think that Charlotte still believes the green_pepper is in the green_treasure_chest.

Summarize this article: Iris Grace, who lives with her family in Leicestershire, began painting last year, and has already been praised by buyers, collectors and galleries for her work's intense colour, immediacy, and open composition.      Her paintings are sold to private art collectors in the UK and around the world for thousands of pounds each, with all profits going towards art materials and therapy.      Arabella Carter-Johnson, Iris’s mother, said that Iris loves being outside and that she can see “so much of nature in her paintings”.      Iris with her cat Thula “She will watch water, trees, wind, leaves, flowers, birds, clouds… she is so interested in movement and how it changes things.”      She added that Iris is “very musical” and has been since she was a baby.      “It was the one thing that always calmed her,” she said. “Iris is particularly into classical music at the moment and knows all of the orchestra instruments. She adores the violin.”      Iris’s cat Thula is another source of inspiration, and features regularly in her work, such as her painting ‘Raining Cats’.      'Raining Cats' by Iris Grace “There have been a lot of references to Monet because of the Impressionistic style. We have had many artists, dealers and galleries contact us who are very complimentary about her work which is lovely,” Iris's mother said.      “For us though the joy that Iris gets from creating her pieces is the highlight, how it changes her mood, how happy it makes her.”      Due to a lack of awareness, people with autism and their friends, family and carers often struggle to explain just how strong an impact it can have on a person’s life. Iris's mother said that her daughter had great success with play therapy, music therapy, and now a new form of speech therapy which uses video, created by a company called Gemiini.      “By following Iris’s interests, her ‘spark’, I have been able to engage her in many things,’ Iris's mother said.      \\"We have started our own activity club that supports children with autism, and run that every Saturday morning.\\"      Iris at work Celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher have shared Iris’s work on social media, while three-time BAFTA award winner Olivia Colman showed her support by reading a poem for a video about Iris.

But as Iris’ work grabbed the spotlight, the family also focused on protecting her and keeping her day-to-day life stable.      “We are trying to keep our lives as normal as possible for Iris, so our same routine continues,” wrote Carter-Johnson. \\"I am educating her at home and this week we have been concentrating on animals, so nothing has changed in Iris's world.\\"      Courtesy Arabella Carter-Johnson      While Iris’ parents say her autism likely helped her to create incredible artwork, it can also make her anxious around new people and she had trouble speaking until recently. While her art has been a way to express herself, her parents are careful not to overwhelm the 5-year-old.      “She has a fantastic concentration span but as her parent and educator I have to keep an eye on that and help her move onto other things,” said Carter-Johnson. “I can see nature in her paintings, water, trees, flowers, and also we can see Thula her cat in many of them.”      Courtesy Arabella Carter-Johnson      The family decided to sell Iris’ paintings both as a way to fund her private therapists and to raise awareness about her condition. According to the family, all the profits from Iris’ work will go to pay for her art materials and her ongoing private therapists. The money also goes to a savings account for Iris and to fund a club for autistic children run out of the Halmshaw home called the Little Explorers Activity Club.      After Iris was introduced to art, Carter-Johnson said, her daughter can now express herself in other ways besides speech or words. Iris’ mother said Iris can get lost in her work and spend as long as two hours painting her abstract pieces.      “She has an understanding of colours and how they interact with each other,” wrote Iris’ parents on a website dedicated to her work. “She beams with excitement and joy when I get out the paints, it lifts her mood everytime.” |||||","output":"Iris Grace is a young girl who started painting last year and has become very popular for her beautiful artwork.

Q:Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Polar compounds, such as water, are compounds that have a partial negative charge on one side of each molecule and a partial positive charge on the other side. All polar compounds contain polar bonds (although not all compounds that contain polar bonds are polar. ) In a polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally. One atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge. The other atom attracts the shared electrons less strongly, so it is has a partial positive charge. In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. This explains why the oxygen side of the water molecule has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen side of the molecule has a partial positive charge.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia? is inside the article: Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony..., can you guess it ?","output":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival and sparked interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia is Symphony No. 5, Op. 50 (1921-1922).

Frustration leads to a writer's block, and the pressure from his fans is mounting. Step 3: The plot begins to develop Jack's best friend, Sarah, suggests a road trip through the English countryside to clear his mind and discover new culinary delights. Jack reluctantly agrees, hoping it will solve his writer's block and provide material for his milestone blog post. Step 4: Portray different adventures and encounters On their journey, Jack and Sarah explore various quirky artisan restaurants, whose chefs proudly prepare meals using traditional British ingredients. Among these food encounters, one left a lasting impression: The English grilled cheese sandwich. Jack immediately connected with the taste and felt that this sandwich represents the essence of British comfort food.

We want to find the number \\"a\\" that makes both sides equal. The equation is: -17822*a - 17818*a = -35598*a - 3234 2. We can make the equation simpler by adding the \\"a\\" parts on the left side.

After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial. Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school.

More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful and sometimes itchy or throbbing. Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support hose, as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition.

To determine which star has more hydrogen reactions in its core, we need to analyze what we know about these stars and what we know about red giants. Red giants form when a star exhausts its hydrogen supply in its core. The core begins to contract, heat up, and start burning hydrogen in a shell around the core. The outer layers of the star expand, and that's how the star becomes a red giant. So, let's break this down: - Vader is a red giant, which means its core is no longer burning hydrogen. - Enterprise is not a red giant, so we can infer that its core is still burning hydrogen.

This phrase is usually followed by comma before introducing the main clause. Hence I added a comma after it.  2. Then, I added a percentage sign after 100 to clarify that this is a percentage and not a raw number. If referring to a percentage it's important to include the % sign for clarity. 3. I added another comma after \\"our software\\", because it completes an independent clause \\"if you are not 100% satisfied with our software\\", and was followed by related information that provided more specific instructions. 4.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

Instead, they type  on computers. But scientists say that method is less helpful. If you need to remember something, write it. Writing notes by hand is much better for long-term memory of idea. So, turn off your computer if you want to remember something. Students who type notes on a keyboard often write down what the teacher says word-for-word. They may write without really thinking about what they are writing. These electronic notes contained  more words. But scientists say it leads to \\" _ .\\" Transcription means to write down something exactly as you hear it. However, students taking notes by writing them, need to first process the information they hear. Then they record just the main parts. They use fewer words. This is because people usually write slower than they type. This kind of process leads to a deeper understanding. The scientists did a research. In the research, students listened to a teacher and then took a test. Some took notes by typing on a computer. The others took notes by writing them down. Both groups performed about the same in remembering facts. But students who typed their notes did much worse on conceptual  questions. These questions required them to understand an idea. Also, scientists found that those who wrote their notes remembered conceptual information better a week later. Scientists believe that the students who took notes by writing them had a deeper understanding of ideas. Scientists know that students probably will still use their computers in class. But they suggest to take notes by hand on screens. They say this might be a good way between different schools.

Summarize this article: Extracts from the \\"missing\\" correspondence are published in the journal Nature. Maurice Wilkins, James Watson and Francis Crick won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the DNA-related work. But many others contributed, including Rosalind Franklin - whose efforts were called \\"witchcraft\\" in one letter. All three Nobel Prizewinners worked in molecular biology, but in different labs. Essentially, there were two main groups, pursuing the discovery of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) structure: Dr Wilkins and Dr Franklin at King's College in London, and Dr Watson and Dr Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. Besides strained relationships, the letters and postcards also give insights into the personalities of the key players. The Cambridge team used some of Dr Franklin's results to build their first DNA model in December 1951. This triple-helix model was wrong, and the scientists were barred from doing any further DNA work. Dr Wilkins then wrote to his colleagues: \\"This is to say how bloody browned off I am entirely, and how rotten I feel about it all, and how entirely friendly I am (though it may appear differently). \\"We are really between forces which may grind all of us into little piecesâ€¦\\" But Dr Crick and Dr Watson appeared to be rather breezy: \\"â€¦cheer up, and take it from us that even if we kicked you in the pants, it was between friends,\\" the pair wrote in response. \\"We hope our little burglary will at least produce a united front in your group!\\" The last phrase referred to strained relations between Dr Wilkins and Dr Franklin. When the latter arrived to King's College, her colleague thought that she would be working for him, but she believed otherwise. This misunderstanding poisoned their relationship, and the tensions were highlighted even further in other letters. Just before Dr Franklin was to leave King's College, Dr Wilkins wrote to the Cambridge scientists that \\"the smoke of witchcraft will soon be getting out of our eyes\\". Explaining the situation to BBC News, Nature's commissioning editor Sara Abdullah said it added to \\"the canon of awful things said about [Dr Franklin]\\". \\"I think 'sexist' is what we are groping around for. \\"Obviously, this is a different time, it's 1953. There was personal tension; she was very unusual in being a leading woman in science at that time. \\"And there were these different styles of working - all these things are captured there, in those few words.\\" In early 1953, Maurice Wilkins showed James Watson the famous \\"Photograph 51\\". It was the crucial X-ray image of DNA made by Dr Franklin in the previous months, and it helped the two Cambridge biologists to develop the historic - and correct - double-helix model. \\"To think that Rosie had all the 3D data for nine months and wouldn't fit a helix to it, and there was I taking her word for it that the data was anti-helical,\\" wrote Dr Wilkins to Dr Crick. \\"Christ.\\" And when the study was published in Nature in April 1953, there were only vague references to Dr Franklin's contribution to the titanic achievement in molecular biology. The correspondence had been thought lost. But it was found earlier this year by Alexander Gann and Jan Witkowski of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York among papers that had belonged to another scientist, Sydney Brenner, who had shared an office with Francis Crick in Cambridge.","output":"This article discusses newly discovered correspondence between Maurice Wilkins, James Watson, and Francis Crick, the 1962 Nobel Prize winners in Medicine for their work on DNA.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Apologetic Hassan Whiteside suspended one game by NBA Updated MAR 10, 2015 10:54p ET MIAMI -- The NBA announced Tuesday that Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside will be suspended one game without pay following his ejection Monday night against the Boston Celtics. A remorseful Whiteside spoke to a large media crowd surrounding him at the conclusion of Tuesday's Heat practice to express his regret over his actions. \\"I felt like I let (my teammates) down and it can't happen again,\\" said Whiteside. \\"We're in a playoff hunt and it was a terrible decision on my part. I just want to apologize to everybody and the Heat fans. I apologized to the coaches and the team.\\" He has now been ejected twice in his last four games and has already totaled 40,000 in fines this season, including 15,000 for his first ejection after fighting with Phoenix Suns center Alex Len on March 2. In a difficult stretch of his short NBA career, he was also benched during the Heat's improbable comeback in the second half from a 35-point deficit in an eventual loss to the Washington Wizards last Friday. His coach and the rest of the team have publicly expressed concern for his recent behavior, but have shown support for him as well. Whiteside said teammates Michael Beasley, Luol Deng and Udonis Haslem have been especially helpful with their words of encouragement and their advice as of late. \\"He's still a family member,\\" said head coach Erik Spoelstra, who didn't rule a team fine or suspension if the NBA had not acted on the matter. \\"It's another learning opportunity. We're going to correct it with him. He wants to, he knows we need him.\\" Whiteside said he personally reached out to Celtics center Kelly Olynyk to say he was sorry for the blindside hit that was called a flagrant 2 foul and earned him an immediate ejection. The Heat would go on to lose the game, which was critical for their playoff hopes. \\"Just because it was such a far journey and I feel like I took some steps back and I'm better than that,\\" he said of why he was so contrite. \\"I regret it a lot. \\"I'm starting to realize I'm a bigger name in the NBA then what I was so it's still a learning experience for me. I'm talking to the veteran guys and I'm talking to Alonzo (Mourning). It's just a process.” While he still maintains he is getting fouled hard in the paint and isn't getting enough calls, he recognizes his actions are unacceptable no matter the circumstances. \\"It's frustrating when somebody is hitting you in the face and you want to just come back and do the best you can and they keep you from it,\\" said Whiteside. \\"It gets frustrating at times but I’ve got to do better keeping calm and keeping a level head because if I get ejected, it hurts everyone.\\" Dwyane Wade had some tough words for his teammate after the game, but has repeatedly stressed the fact that Whiteside has not been a problem with the team on or off the court since his arrival midway through the season. Having played alongside dominant centers such as Shaquille O'Neal and Mourning in his career, he knows that opposing teams will stop short of nothing to try to get in their heads. \\"He just has to understand it's going to happen,\\" Wade said. \\"Big guys that are dominant and that are aggressive in their own right and like to dunk on people, they’re going to get fouled hard. There’s going to be a lot of stuff that he's going to have to overcome. He's a genuine guy, he's a nice guy. So he's just got to understand that and he's still young. He's learning it in front of everyone's eyes.\\" Though he claims these are the first ejections ever in his basketball career, he assured the large media group assembled around him that he has learned his lesson and does not want to harm his team going forward because of his attitude. \\"It happened, there's really nothing I can do about it,\\" he said. \\"You can dwell on it or you can move on from it and just show people that you're not that kind of guy. I’ll use this as a learning point.\\" You can follow Surya Fernandez on Twitter @SuryaHeatNBA or email him at SuryaFoxSports@gmail.com.

Question: Stella Artois originates from which Belgian city, the name being shown on its bottles and cans? Answer:","output":"Stella Artois, a popular and widely recognized beer brand, originally hails from the Belgian city of Leuven. The name of this city is prominently displayed on the bottles and cans of Stella Artois, proudly linking the brand to its historical roots and the brewing tradition for which the city is renowned. Leuven, the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flanders region of Belgium, boasts a long and rich history of beer production. The city is known for being home to some of the oldest and most prestigious breweries that have played a significant role in shaping the global beer industry. Stella Artois was first created in 1926 as a Christmas beer by Brouwerij Artois, a brewery that traces its origins back to 1366 when it was known as Den Horen Brewery. The name \\"Stella\\" means \\"star\\" in Latin, signifying the festive spirit in which the beer was launched. Stella Artois has since grown to become a leading global beer brand, enjoyed by millions of people around the world. The brewery itself merged with Interbrew, creating the largest brewing company in the world at the time. Later, Interbrew merged with the Brazilian brewery AmBev to form InBev, which ultimately acquired Anheuser-Busch, making the combined company Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev). Despite its growth and the various mergers under which the brand has operated, Stella Artois has managed to retain its identity and heritage, staying true to the values of its Belgian roots. The brewing process of Stella Artois has remained relatively unchanged since its creation. The beer is brewed using the finest natural ingredients, such as Belgian malted barley, selected Saaz hops from the Czech Republic, and pure water. The use of maize and the distinctive Stella Artois yeast strain contribute to the beer's unique flavor profile and its refreshing quality. The brewing process is carefully overseen by skilled brewmasters who have honed their craft over many years. The brand's strong association with Leuven has also contributed to the city's reputation as a beer destination. Beer enthusiasts and tourists alike flock to Leuven to explore its vibrant beer culture, visit notable breweries, and participate in beer-related events that showcase the city's brewing prowess. In this regard, Stella Artois serves as both a symbol and an ambassador of the rich brewing tradition of Leuven and the Belgian beer culture more broadly. In conclusion, Stella Artois is a world-famous beer brand that originates from the Belgian city of Leuven. This fact is proudly displayed on its bottles and cans, symbolizing the deep and enduring connection between the beer and its birthplace. Over the years, Stella Artois has grown in popularity and reach, but its home city, Leuven, remains an integral part of its identity and its commitment to preserving the time-honored traditions of Belgian beer craftsmanship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What mythical creature is a symbol of Wales????","output":"The mythical creature that serves as a symbol of Wales is the dragon, specifically, the red dragon known as \\"Y Ddraig Goch\\" in Welsh. This legendary creature has a long association with the country's history, culture, and folklore, dating back to ancient times. According to legend, the red dragon prevailed in a battle against an invading white dragon, ultimately representing the success of the native Welsh people against various efforts to conquer their land, particularly the Anglo-Saxons and the Saxons. The story was later incorporated into the Arthurian legends, where Merlin is said to have prophesized about the victory of the red dragon representing a future king of Britain. The origin of the Welsh dragon traces its roots to Celtic mythology and symbolism, where dragons were often seen as symbols of power, wisdom, and sovereignty. The Celtic people highly regarded these mythical creatures, and as such, the red dragon subsequently became an emblem of the Celtic tribes' collective power and unity. When the Romans conquered Britain, they adopted the dragon symbolism, incorporating it into their military standards. It is believed that the red dragon was included in the battle standards of Roman soldiers stationed in Wales. Over time, the Welsh people identified with and adopted the red dragon as their own national symbol. In the early medieval period, the use of the red dragon emblem gained prominence among the Welsh royalty, particularly in the 800s under the reign of Cadwaladr, king of Gwynedd. It is said that Cadwaladr had a dragon flag adorned with Y Ddraig Goch. Many centuries later, during the reign of King Henry VII, the dragon became an important symbol of Welsh identity and resistance. After leading the Welsh forces in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Henry VII integrated the red dragon into the Tudor royal standard, displaying the creature alongside a green and white field - the colors of the House of Tudor. In 1959, the red dragon was officially recognized as the national flag of Wales. The flag features a bold red dragon set against a green and white background. Today, the red dragon symbolizes the spirit of the Welsh people, and it is used across numerous aspects of Welsh culture, from sports to tourism, politics, and celebrations. In conclusion, the red dragon, Y Ddraig Goch, is a potent emblem of Welsh identity, reflecting the nation's rich history, Celtic heritage, and resilient spirit. This mythical creature is deeply ingrained in the folklore and traditions of Wales, standing proudly as a symbol of strength, perseverance, and unity for the country and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The problem gives you a multiple-choice question and requires you to classify the answer into one of the given options ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'). Here are the simple steps to solve the problem: Step 1: Analyze the problem You are given that: - The jogger is running at 9 km/hr - The jogger is 240 meters ahead of the train - The train is 100 meters long and running at 45 km/hr - Both are moving in the same direction Step 2: Convert speeds and distances into the same units - To make our calculations easier, let's convert both speeds to meters per second (m/s).  - 1 km/hr = (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 5/18 m/s - Speed of jogger = 9 km/hr * 5/18 = 45 / 18 = 2.5 m/s - Speed of train = 45 km/hr * 5/18 = 225 / 18 = 12.5 m/s Step 3: Calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed. - Relative speed = 12.5 m/s - 2.5 m/s = 10 m/s Step 4: Calculate the distance the train needs to cover to pass the jogger To fully pass the jogger, the train must cover the distance consisting of the 240 meters initially between them and the full length of the train (100 meters). - Total distance = 240 m + 100 m = 340 m Step 5: Calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the jogger We can find the time by dividing the total distance by the relative speed. - Time = Total distance / Relative speed = 340 m / 10 m/s = 34 seconds Step 6: Identify the correct option The answer is 34 seconds, which corresponds to option 'c'. So the correct answer is: c) 34 sec"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Researchers have just offered evidence in a study that says obesity  appears to spread through society. But the findings might also offer hope.  If friends help make obesity acceptable, then they might also be influential in losing the fat. The researchers note that support groups are already an effective tool in dealing with other socially influenced problems, like alcoholism .  The findings appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers used information collected from 12,000 people. It was collected between 1972 and 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study.  The information was highly detailed. There was even contact information for close friends of the people in the study. The researchers examined more than 40,000 social ties. They found a person's chances of becoming severely overweight increased by 50% if a friend had become obese. A sister or brother of a person who became obese had a 40% increased chance of becoming obese. The risk for a wife or husband was a little less than that. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School was a lead researcher in the study. He says there is a direct causal relationship between a person getting fat and being followed in weight gain by a friend. The study found that the sex of the friends was also an influence. In same-sex friendship, a person had a 71% increased risk of becoming obese. Men had a 44% increased risk of becoming obese after weight gain in a brother. In sisters, it was 67%. The researchers also considered the effect of where people lived in relation to each other. James Fowler of the University of California was the other lead expert. He says a friend who lives a few hundred kilometers away has as much influence as one in the same neighborhood.

Rowling continued defending her Harry Potter play, celebrity couple John Legend and Chrissy Teigen took a bite out of Pierce Morgan and Hillary Clinton too took a shot at one of the most notorious trolls of all. While there were no surprises when Republican nominee Donald Trump called out President Obama for supporting fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, it was Clinton’s response that nearly caused a Twitter singularity from its reactions. In three short words, Clinton’s reply of “Delete your account” has amassed over 400,000 retweets and nearly 500,000 likes. Following boxing legend Muhammad Ali’s death, many celebrated Ali’s contributions to the sport and his activism on Twitter, inspired by his Muslim faith. Civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis tweeted an old photo of Ali encouraging everyone to get the vote out, with the fitting tagline “It’s your fight.” The only truth here is that a relationship came to an end & what remains is a huge amount of love and respect — Calvin Harris (@CalvinHarris) June 2, 2016 After a breakup between musicians Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris which went unavoidably public, Harris took to Twitter to explain that it had ended in a respectful and thankfully non-hostile way. To presumably show she agreed, Swift retweeted. In the fallout of the trial for Brock Turner, who received only six months in jail for sexual assault, Journalist Lauren Duca posted a screenshot of the letter Turner’s father had written as an example of deep-seated rape culture. Namely, the letter glossed over the rape as “20 minutes of action” and lamented that Turner no longer enjoys steaks. User Leonardo Semma, who’d just graduated from high school threw back to what he called his greatest high school achievement: getting suspended for calling out his school’s superintendent on Twitter. Tweeting the superintendent to “get his ass out here” to clear some snow from the parking lots, he not only received a suspension, but the superintendent blocked him on Twitter. Harry Potter author and Twitter celebrity in her own right, J.K. Rowling, has been steadily promoting the Potter expanded universe play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. This has included defending the casting of black actress Noma Dumezweni as Hermione Granger, and she’s shut down several complaints that a white actress should have been cast instead. TV personality and noted troll Piers Morgan received some insults of his own after requesting people not sugercoat his life, musician John Legend pleasantly suggested Morgan test that out for himself (although Legend just said to retire from his job, not die). His wife, model Chrissy Teigen, added an extra layer of shade and said that being a troll isn’t really an actual job you can retire from.

Alec The answer is:","output":"Alec was the name of the jockey riding the horse named Black. Step 1: Develop the main characters Our story revolves around Alec, a talented but underestimated young jockey, and Black, a magnificent and mysterious black racehorse. Both characters have their unique qualities: Alec has a natural connection with horses, while Black seems to have an untamed energy and remarkable speed. Step 2: Establish the setting The movie is set in the world of horse racing, with most events occurring at an old racetrack, as well as at stables, on training grounds, and in different towns where competitions take place. Step 3: Build the movie plot In the beginning, we introduce Alec and his dream of becoming a champion jockey. He gets a job at a local stable owned by a retired jockey, who becomes Alec's mentor and helps him develop his skills. One day, a mysterious man arrives at the stable to sell Black, a horse he can no longer keep due to financial issues. Alec connects with Black from the moment they meet and convinces his mentor to buy the horse, believing they have a chance to win races together. Alec and Black begin training. The horse has an incredible raw talent and speed that they refine over time. As they practice together, they form an unbreakable bond, becoming inseparable both on and off the racetrack.  The duo begins to participate in horse races, surprising everyone with their talent and success. However, they face challenges: other jockeys and trainers feel threatened by Alec and Black's abilities and attempt to sabotage their growth with underhanded tactics.  Throughout the story, we learn more about the mysterious man who sold Black and why the horse was so important to him. His daughter was a promising young jockey who tragically died in a racing accident while riding Black. The man blamed himself and the horse for her death, leading to his decision to sell the horse. Despite the odds stacked against them, Alec and Black ultimately make it to a prestigious racing event where they have the chance to prove themselves. In the movie's climax, they face off against their biggest rivals in the most important race of their lives. In the final race, Alec and Black manage to overcome all challenges, including betrayal and sabotage, and win the race in a thrilling photo finish. Their victory proves that talent and hard work, combined with a genuine connection between rider and horse, can overcome any obstacles. Step 4: Close the story The movie ends with Alec and Black becoming legendary figures in the horse racing world. The mysterious man who sold Black comes to terms with his past, having seen Alec help the horse reach its true potential.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is possible to start finding pathways to letting others help you. One of the best ways of doing this is to follow your first mind. The minute you have a conscious thought that you are facing something you cannot alone handle, seek out help.  Don't take the time to talk yourself out of it. Remember to make a note of the solution you receive for your problem. This will help you when you face a similar situation again When the thought crosses your mind that you could do with help sorting out a problem - carrying a heavy box, making dinner, working out a work dilemma, etc. - act on it. Decide who you will ask, phrase the request in your head, and go and ask for help. If another person is being kind in offering help, accepting it at face value is the first step. Yes, there are people with bad intentions, but there are also those who want to do good by others. Look for those people in the world and stop focusing on the negative. Seek out the goodness in others and  restore your faith in humanity. An easy way to do this is by volunteering. Watching others give of themselves selflessly to assist those who are less fortunate is a terrific way to recognize the good in people. Volunteering also helps you to notice how people depend on one another within a community, and how all parts must work together to function as a whole. Choose wisely and carefully. Avoid people who make you feel like a lesser person in any way. Find people you really trust to try out asking for help first. This will allow you to open up bit by bit, and not be exposed to someone who might not do the right thing by you, or who might purposely make you feel weak for asking. In order to get, you need to give. If you keep cutting yourself off from opening up to others, you risk not sharing your skills, talents, and abilities with others in need of help. In helping another person, you cease to focus on yourself. And when you cease to focus on yourself, it is far easier to accept support back from another.  In giving of yourself (your time, your listening ear, your love, your care, etc.), you are helping another learn more about you, be able to care for you, and believe that you will reciprocate the attention that they bestow upon you. Beyond receiving anything in return, giving also promotes cooperation, strengthens bonds, boosts feelings of gratitude, and is just downright good for your health. . In order to receive help, you need to trust the other person and to trust that you're worthy of help (self-respect). This might be the hardest part but it is absolutely vital. Wholesome, accepting, self-assured trust is capable of absorbing rejection, attracting genuine help, and will easily detect the occasional exploitative person. Choosing to trust requires that you:  modify your expectations - remember that people are only human and they have both good and bad traits (so do you!)  recognize that disappointment, fear, abandonment, and rejection are possible in all relationships find yourself worthy and capable of making wise decisions and being around decent people It can be all too easy to dismiss the worth or depth of your own problems.There is no hierarchy of problems, or scale of emotional pain. A problem is a problem, whatever its ease or difficulty. The litmus test is how much it is impacting you negatively and preventing you from moving forward. Belittling your problem as not worthy of being solved only serves to make it even more challenging to cope with. of the problems that no one can fix.

In the morning, Will finds himself on the bank of a stream, with blood all over his face and hands. He visits Dr. Vijav Alezais, who gives him an amulet to protect him from turning completely into a wolf. Alezais asks Will to bite him, as Alezais does not have long to live and would prefer \\"demonization to death\\". After refusing, Will keeps the amulet so that he will not transform at the next full moon. Calling Laura to explain, Will, now a werewolf, breaks into the zoo and steals handcuffs from a policeman. Muggers want his wallet, but he attacks and bites the fingers off of one of them. He wakes up in his hotel, with no memory of what happened. Will outmaneuvers Stewart at their work and fires him, urinating on his shoes in a bathroom and claiming he is \\"marking his territory\\". While washing his hands, Will finds fingers in his handkerchief and realizes he has attacked and wounded someone. Stewart attempts to frame Will in order to seize his job back.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease.  I am facing a new situation today: Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide? Answer:","output":"Based on the principle of chemical equilibrium and the knowledge acquired from the background article, we can analyze Jennifer's and Justin's reactions.  In the reaction that Jennifer and Justin are performing, hydrogen gas and glucose are the reactants, and carbon dioxide and oxygen gas are the products. The reaction can be represented as: H2 (g) + glucose (s) ⇌ CO2 (g) + O2 (g) Now, let's consider the changes made by Jennifer and Justin individually: 1. Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture. When the concentration of glucose decreases, the system will respond by favoring the forward reaction that replaces the glucose. Therefore, the reaction will proceed in the direction of producing more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. In this case, Jennifer's reaction will start producing more carbon dioxide. 2. Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. When the concentration of carbon dioxide decreases, the system will respond by favoring the reverse reaction, in which hydrogen gas and glucose react to form more carbon dioxide. Therefore, Justin's reaction will also start producing more carbon dioxide, since the reaction is compensating for the loss of carbon dioxide by favoring the formation of more products. In conclusion, both Jennifer's reaction and Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide after they remove glucose and carbon dioxide, respectively. This observation is based on the principle of chemical equilibrium, which dictates that when the concentration of a substance within a reaction system is changed, the reaction will adjust accordingly to reestablish equilibrium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is also trying to find his way through the maze that is high school but faces constant bullying from his classmates led by Flash Thompson. During this time, a world-renowned scientist, Dr. Celeste Warren, returns to her alma mater, Columbia University, to continue her groundbreaking research on genetics and pioneering new projects in genetic engineering. Dr. Warren has been studying DNA structures of various species with the aim of harnessing their unique abilities to address human physical limitations and diseases. Peter's biology class at Midtown High School is signed up for a field trip to Dr. Warren's cutting-edge genetics lab at Columbia University. Seeing this as an opportunity to escape his mundane life for a day and further explore his passion for science, Peter is incredibly excited. Act 2: As the field trip commences, Peter’s interest and excitement reach their peak when Dr. Warren presents a new project on synthesizing the genetic materials of various spiders to create a genetically-altered super-spider. She explains the possible benefits of this project, such as developing an advanced understanding of genetic engineering to battle degenerative diseases and potentially improving human physical capabilities. During the tour, Peter gets separated from his classmates, when he stumbles upon a restricted area within the lab, where Dr. Warren has kept the genetically-altered super-spider for further observation. Curiosity gets the better of him and Peter ventures in to take a closer look. In a twist of fate, the super-spider escapes its containment and bites Peter on his hand before scurrying off to the ventilation system. Peter initially feels a sudden surge of pain from the bite but manages to hide the incident from his classmates and teachers. As the day ends and Peter returns home, he starts to notice subtle changes in his body and senses, like an increased agility, strength and his ability to cling to surfaces. Act 3: During the course of the next few days, Peter gradually discovers the extent of his newfound abilities and the changes brought on by the spider bite. He also realizes that, like his late Uncle Ben told him, \\"with great power comes great responsibility.\\" He decides to keep his newfound powers a secret but uses them to help people in need and prevent small-scale crimes. As Peter becomes more adept in his new role as a friendly neighborhood vigilante, he discovers that Dr. Warren's lab funding was coming from a mysterious corporation with a hidden agenda. They have been secretly funding genetic engineering projects to create bio-weapons for military and political purposes. The corporation has been tracking Peter ever since the incident at the lab, knowing that he has gained enhanced abilities due to the spider bite and could be crucial to their bio-weapon development plan. Act 4: As Peter struggles to balance his responsibilities as a student, a son, a friend, and a hero, his life is put even more at risk when he uncovers the full scope of the mysterious corporation's intentions. They have kidnapped Dr. Warren and are forcing her to create human-animal hybrid experiments, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for humanity. Determined to save Dr. Warren and put an end to the corporation's sinister plans, Peter takes on the responsibility of stopping them while also juggling his increasingly complicated personal life and revealing his feelings to Mary Jane. In a thrilling final showdown, Peter, now embracing the superhero persona of \\"Spider-Man,\\" manages to stop the corporation and rescue Dr. Warren, who then destroys her research in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands again. Epilogue: Grateful and inspired by Peter's selflessness, Dr. Warren decides to dedicate her life to using genetics for the betterment of mankind, and with a newfound purpose, vows to protect and support Spider-Man in his future endeavors. Peter, despite learning that being a hero is not without its price, embraces his dual life as both an ordinary high-schooler and the extraordinary crime-fighting Spider-Man. The movie ends on a hopeful note, with Peter and Mary Jane finally professing their love for each other, and Dr. Warren warning Peter that he will face even greater challenges in the days to come, setting the stage for thrilling adventures in future sequels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Humans have been keeping animals as pets for tens of thousands of years, but Dr Jean-Loup Rault, an animal scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, believes new companions are coming: robot pets. \\"Technology is moving very fast,\\" Rault told ABC News, \\"The Tamagotchi in the early 1990s was really the first robotic pet, and now Sony and other big companies have improved them a lot.\\" This may not _ pet lovers. After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do. But for our next generation who are in constant touch with smart technology, a future in which lovely pets needn't have a heartbeat might not be a far-fetched dream. Question: We can learn from the passage that  _  .

Studies suggest that humans are capable of forming bonds with these intelligent machines, as evidenced by individuals giving names to their cars and children creating life stories for their toy animals. However, there are concerns regarding the potential impact of robotic pets on human attitudes toward living animals and their welfare, as well as the possibility of a generational transition in which traditional pets could be replaced by their robotic counterparts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water.  and a hint : As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson.  Please answer this question : In which case the solute would be more soluble, case A or case B? A:","output":"In case B the solute would be more soluble. According to the given hint, solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. In test A, Keith used a liquid solute in a solvent at room temperature, whereas in test B, he increased the temperature. Therefore, the solute would be more soluble in case B due to the higher temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Theodor Seuss Geisel ( ( listen); March 2, 1904 - September 24, 1991) was an American author, political cartoonist, poet, animator, book publisher, and artist, best known for authoring more than 60 children's books under the pen name Doctor Seuss (abbreviated Dr. Seuss) (). His work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death. Geisel adopted the name \\"Dr. Seuss\\" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and a graduate student at the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (nee Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel.  His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.  Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief. While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the college humor magazine. To continue work on the Jack-O-Lantern without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name \\"Seuss\\". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his \\"big inspiration for writing\\" at Dartmouth.  Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a PhD in English literature. At Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career.","output":"This text is about Theodor Seuss Geisel, an American author, political cartoonist, poet, animator, book publisher, and artist, best known for authoring more than 60 children's books under the pen name Doctor Seuss (abbreviated Dr. Seuss)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species or in an individual organism and for a test that detects this complement or measures the number. Is this statement correct \\"does a karyotype tell all of a person's genetic characteristics\\"?","output":"The statement \\"does a karyotype tell all of a person's genetic characteristics?\\" is not entirely correct. While a karyotype does provide an overview of an individual's genetic makeup, it doesn't cover all aspects of a person's genetic characteristics. To understand why this is the case, it's important to understand what exactly a karyotype reveals. The primary function of karyotyping is to examine the number, size, and shape of an individual's chromosomes. In humans, a normal karyotype consists of 22 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes, making a total of 46 chromosomes. When analyzed, a karyotype can help to identify genetic disorders that are associated with having an additional chromosome (such as Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21) or missing one (such as Turner syndrome, which occurs in females when a sexual chromosome is missing), or alterations in the structure of a chromosome. However, even though karyotyping can identify these broad, chromosomal-level genetic disorders, it lacks the granularity to identify smaller scale genetic variations, or so-called point mutations. For example, it won't typically detect genetic disorders that are caused by a mutation in a single gene (like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia), nor will it identify less drastic forms of chromosomal abnormalities, like small insertions, deletions, or inversions of the genetic material. What's more, besides genetic mutations that directly lead to disease, there's a whole other category of genetic characteristics that a karyotype can't identify, namely those that contribute to the huge range of normal human variation we see in traits like height, eye color, skin pigmentation, and others. These traits are usually polygenic, i.e., affected by many genes working together, and are often influenced by the environment as well. Similarly, a karyotype won't identify the epigenetic modifications -- changes to the DNA molecule that don't alter the sequence of genes, but can still impact gene expression. Therefore, while a karyotype does provide a considerable amount of information regarding an individual's genetic makeup, it certainly doesn't tell all of a person's genetic characteristics. For a more comprehensive analysis of an individual's genome, techniques like whole-genome sequencing or exome sequencing would be more appropriate as they allow for the direct examination of an individual's specific DNA sequence, thereby enabling the detection of single-gene disorders and other genetic variations at a much higher resolution than karyotyping can provide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, we have this equation: -58 * k - 147 = -79 * k Now, imagine you have -58 apples in a basket and you multiply the apples by \\"k\\". Then you also have 147 marbles.

To do this, we'll add 79 * k to both sides: (-58 * k + 79 * k) - 147 = -79 * k + 79 * k This simplifies to: 21 * k - 147 = 0 Now, we want to find out the number of marbles (147) needed to make both sides equal. So, let's add 147 to each side: 21 * k - 147 + 147 = 0 + 147 This simplifies to: 21 * k = 147 Now, we need to find out how many times we need to multiply the apples (21) to get 147 marbles.

In rare cases, parents, teachers, and administrators are also implicated. However, all efforts to improve the quality of education are doomed to fail if the system itself is not examined and understood to be the most significant impediment. After over six years in the making, THE WAR ON KIDS reveals that the problems with public education ultimately stem from the institution itself. Astonishingly all efforts at reform consistently avoid even considering this to be a possibility and the future for children and American democracy are at stake.In 95 minutes, THE WAR ON KIDS exposes the many ways the public school system has failed children and our future by robbing students of all freedoms due largely to irrational fears. Children are subjected to endure prison-like security, arbitrary punishments, and pharmacological abuse through the forced prescription of dangerous drugs. Even with these measures, schools not only fail to educate students, but the drive to teach has become secondary to the need to control children.THE WAR ON KIDS begins with the history of Zero Tolerance policy. In the 1990s, almost all schools began instituting guidelines that were originally designed to keep weapons and drugs off campus. Very quickly, school officials began to arbitrarily decide what should be considered a weapon and what should be considered a drug. Hundreds of situations followed where children were (and continue to be) suspended or expelled for possessing food knives, nail clippers, key chains, chicken strips, aspirin, and candy. Kindergarteners were even suspended for playing cops and robbers and using their fingers as guns. Under the guise of Zero Tolerance, administrators have been able to wield tremendous power without the burden of responsibility and this authority continues to be increasingly abused. Students invariably feel despondent and fearful in the Kafka-esque state that has been...

On page 110, the recipe for lentil and garlic-sausage stew calls for two tablespoons of salt. I assumed that was a typo, but even with two teaspoons of salt, the dish was inedible. I can only assume that M. Valenti expects you to use the very same sausage he uses; he makes no allowances for variations.The recipes also call for an annoying number of exotic ingredents, and offers no suggestions for substitutions. Porcini mushrooms, penette pasta, imported Italian tuna, arborio rice, smoked duck. This exotica might make the restaurant dishes spectacular, but for the home cook, they serve only to render the recipes expensive and unforgiving.

The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost.  However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network.  Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas.  There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold.

Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window.  At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.  He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack. Disguising herself, she goes to a bar where Carl is drinking and signals her availability. Terry follows her as she leaves to go home and, when Carl attacks, the two are able to repel him. He escapes, only to be caught by the police who Terry forewarned. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that plots with Denise?, what is it ?

Q: Context: The extracellular interactions of plasma clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa) with tissue factor (TF) on the cell surface trigger intracellular signaling events involved in multiple physiological processes. TF expression is related to the metastatic potential of tumor cells and is a significant risk factor in the development of hepatic metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. At present, it is unclear how the interaction between TF and FVIIa influences the development of metastasis in colon cancer.', 'We used a stable LOVO cell line derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma for our model Western blot analysis, Northern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and RNA inference (RNAi), and the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System technology were utilized to determine if MMP7 can be up-regulated by the VIIa/TF complex.', 'Northern blot analysis confirmed that the plasma clotting factor FVIIa/TF complex resulted in a marked increase in MMP7 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner via the p38 pathway in vitro. The proximal promoter of the human MMP7 gene was cloned into a luciferase reporter construction (MMP7.luc1592). Upon treatment with FVIIa, reporter activity in LOVO cells was increased by 2.5-fold. TF RNAi almost completely abolished FVIIa-mediated MMP7.luc induction. Deletion constructs from MMP7.luc1592 further defined an active promoter region. Answer: Taken together, these data provide evidence that expression of MMP7 in colon cancer may be regulated by FVIIa and TF at the transcriptional level. MMP7 may act as a downstream mediator of FVIIa/TF signal transduction to facilitate the development of metastasis in colon cancer.

Use 40 to 60-grit sandpaper to sand the edges until they are smooth. By removing the bottom of the bucket, it will be easier to lift the bucket off of the sand.  If you do not want to remove the bottom yourself, then ask the hardware store if they can do it for you. Alternatively, use a regular bucket without the bottom removed if you do not have a 1 gallon (3.8 l) bucket. You can purchase 1 gallon (3.8 l) buckets, saws, and sandpaper from your local hardware store. Fill a third of the bucket with sand. Add an equal amount of water to the sand.

However, we can infer the reason based on the context. Riding sidesaddle might feel unstable because it requires the rider to sit with both legs on one side of the horse, which can make it difficult to maintain balance and control while riding. This instability could be particularly challenging for someone who is not experienced or comfortable riding horses, as Rin seems to be.

Albert Camus (French: [albeR kamy]; 7 November 1913 - 4 January 1960) was a French Nobel Prize winning author, journalist, and philosopher. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay The Rebel that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom. Camus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as one, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: \\"No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked...\\". Camus was born in Algeria to a Pied-Noir family, and studied at the University of Algiers. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons to \\"denounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA\\".

Write highlights for this article: A ceasefire negotiated between rival Muslim and Christian militias brought a brief respite Saturday to a Central African Republic town after two days of violent clashes. The truce between the Muslim Seleka militia and the Christian anti-Balaka in Bossangoa allowed aid agencies to begin assessing the needs of the population caught in the midst of the violence. At the Ecole Liberte school, where a makeshift displaced camp sprang up in September to harbor fleeing Muslims, the numbers swelled during the clashes from around 2,500 displaced to nearly 10,000. The people there are in need of almost everything: food, water and shelter. Over in a Catholic Church compound where 35,000 Christians sought refuge from the Seleka militias in September, the camp is more established, but water and food supplies are dwindling and there is very little shelter from the elements. Malaria and malnutrition are all too common among the camps' denizens. A tense standoff had developed earlier between the Seleka and the regional peacekeeping force, FOMAC, after the militia threw grenades into the compound in an attempt to storm it. A soldier from FOMAC was killed during an exchange of fire. There is still no official death toll, but witnesses at the Ecole Liberte camp told CNN at least 19 Muslims were killed in what has become a spiraling cycle of retribution between the two communities. The anti-Balaka began targeting Muslims after tens of thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes as Seleka militias marauded through the countryside. 'Extremely dire circumstances' Julian Donald overseeing a hospital in Bossangoa managed by Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the aid group had worked through the violence, almost overwhelmed by the flood of patients. \\"We have been fully operational the entire time,\\" he said. \\"I can't give you any numbers right now, I'm sorry, all I can say is it's still ongoing.\\" But the work he and his agency do is not enough, Donald said. The Central African Republic desperately needs more help from the outside world. \\"A situation where you have hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances, I would hope that the international community would mobilize to provide them assistance,\\" he said. \\"The fact that we haven't seen it happen yet is a tragedy.\\" Some help could be on the way. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution approving military intervention in the Central African Republic by an African Union-led force, backed by French troops, to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. The number of African Union peacekeeping troops in the country will increase to 6,000 -- up from the current 3,500 -- the French presidency said. Central African Republic: What's going on, what's at stake, what's next. French forces arrive. France has named this mission in its former colony Operation Sangaris, after a species of butterfly there. There will be 1,600 troops in the Central African Republic by the end of Saturday, French President Francois Hollande said at the Peace and Security in Africa Summit in Paris. By Saturday evening, some of them had arrived in the northern city of Bossangoa. France's goal is for the nation to be able to hold elections once security is restored, in the same way that France helped Mali return to democracy, Hollande said. France's intervention in the Central African Republic is for humanitarian reasons, not to fight terrorism, he said. There have not been many incidents of violence in the country Saturday, Hollande added. The start of the French soldiers' new operation in the CAR capital was announced Friday morning by Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on the French radio station RFI. About 185 miles south of Bossangoa, Bangui has also been rocked by two days of clashes. Many have flocked to the city's airport, hoping to find safety there. \\"We estimate at least at 400 to 500 people have been killed so far in Bangui and the killings continue,\\" Peter N. Bouckaert, emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, told CNN Saturday. \\"Two hundred and eighty bodies were recovered as of yesterday, but the Red Cross tells us there are more bodies on the streets that they are working to recover.\\" Medecins Sans Frontieres said Friday that at least 92 bodies had been brought to the morgue of a hospital where its staff is working. Another 170 people have been treated for injuries, including gunshot, machete or knife wounds, it said. Opinion: Why Central African Republic is slipping close to catastrophe. Air sorties. A French Defense Ministry statement early Saturday said three helicopters and hundreds more troops had arrived in Bangui. French troops have been out on patrol in a bid to restore calm to the city, which remains tense, as well as working to safeguard French nationals and secure the airport, the statement said. Aerial sorties have also been launched above the capital to signal the French forces' presence to armed forces thought to be opposed to them. Back at the Catholic Church compound in Bossangoa, people scattered, screaming, as the unfamiliar boom of a low-flying jet swept over them. The horror soon turned to laughs of jubilation, however, with shouts of \\"The French! The French!\\" Desperate for help from the outside world, they hoped the sonic boom was a sign from the French forces that they would soon be there too.

He looked like not a salesman but a student like me. I sensed a strange feeling -- as if I had met him before. He began patiently showing me each model. With his help, I decided to buy one computer with enough functions at a very low price. I enjoyed this shopping experience because of his smile.
