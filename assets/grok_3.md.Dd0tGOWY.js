Johnny English is a kindhearted but inept MI7 secret agent with dreams of being their most trusted employee. After Agent One dies in a submarine accident unknowingly caused by English, the remaining agents are assassinated via a bombing at Agent One's funeral, leaving English as the lone surviving agent capable of finishing the mission Agent One left when he died.  English is assigned to thwart a plot to steal the Crown Jewels, which are on display at the Tower of London. During the display, the power suddenly suffers a blackout and the jewels are stolen. During the chaos, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an assailant to make up for his mistakes. He later makes up a false description of the \\"assailant\\" to MI7 head Pegasus. English and his assistant Angus Bough find that the jewels were removed via a hole dug beneath their display case. The two follow a tunnel where they confront the two thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a hearse, with English trying to pursue them but he mistakes another hearse for the escaped vehicle to which he accidentally gatecrashes a funeral until Bough comes to his aid by pretending English is an escaped mental patient. English connects the thieves to Pascal Sauvage, a French prison entrepreneur who helped restore the Crown Jewels. Pegasus finds the claims of his involvement absurd and warns English not to involve Sauvage. In the car park, English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta but are unharmed. English again encounters Lorna in a sushi restaurant as he recognized her pink motorcycle. During their meeting, English is suspicious of her since he has seen her at two of their crime scenes and her records cannot be found on any government computer. English and Bough then decide to break into Sauvage's headquarters via parachutes, but English mistakenly lands on a visually identical tower which turns out to be the City Hospital.","output":"In the given paragraph, it is Johnny English who makes up a fake description of the assailant to MI7 head Pegasus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who received an award from the Nobel Committee in 2016?, using the article: Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century where he was called \\"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation\\". In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \\"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\\" President Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012, \\"There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.\\" For 20 years, academics lobbied the Swedish Academy to give Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature. He received the award in 2016, making Dylan the first musician to be awarded the Literature Prize. Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history: ...a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards. Rolling Stone has ranked Dylan at number one in its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, and listed \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" as the \\"Greatest Song of all Time\\" in their 2011 list. In 2008, it was estimated that Dylan had sold about 120 million albums worldwide. Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie, the blues of Robert Johnson, and what he termed the \\"architectural forms\\" of Hank Williams songs, Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \\"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\\". Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \\"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while.

Downing Street confirmed that British troops will no longer lead combat operations by the end of 2013, handing command responsibility to local Afghan forces 12 months earlier than expected. Plans have now been drawn up to cut the force of 9,000 British troops by at least 4,000 next year, with a series of steady drawdowns in troops throughout the year. Previously, David Cameron has said that British forces will no longer be in a combat role by the end of 2014, but ministers had failed to spell out that the handover to Afghan commanders will begin much earlier than that.

As a key figure in the FTP-MOI (Francs-tireurs et Partisans de la Main-d’œuvre Immigrée), he played a major role in the anti-fascist and labor movements. Manouchian was part of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 1934-1944, and later the party was known as Khaleyan in Armenian. Born on September 1, 1906, in Adıyaman, Ottoman Empire, Missak Manouchian experienced considerable hardships in his early life. Despite this, he emerged as an outstanding figure in the French Resistance, particularly in the Parisian region, leading a group famously known as the \\"Manouchian Group.\\"  Manouchian married Mélinée Assadourian, who was also involved in the Resistance. Their collective efforts significantly helped France in the fight against German occupation during World War II. Sadly, Manouchian's dedication to his cause ultimately led to his death. On February 21, 1944, he was executed by firing squad at fort Mont-Valérien in Paris, occupied France. His final resting place is Cimetière Parisien d'Ivry, Ivry-sur-Seine.  After his execution, the German authorities and Vichy regime used the \\"Affiche Rouge\\" (Red Poster) propaganda campaign to discredit Manouchian and his group, branding them as criminals. However, they could not deter the growing support for the French Resistance, and Manouchian's sacrifices and efforts were later recognized and celebrated as a symbol of the struggle against fascism and oppression. Today, his image from the Affiche Rouge, a portrait kept in the German Federal Archives, serves as a lasting reminder of his unwavering commitment to the cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. The rule of law was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.  Question: \\"Who built towns, roads and industries of Europe's southwestern extremity?\\" Answer: \\"Iberians\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.

Researchers from CSIRO Mathematical and Information Sciences in prefix = st1 /Sydneyreport their findings in the November issue of the journalSkin Research and Technology. The software, developed with a UKcompany, will make it easier for researchers developing hair removal creams to accurately assess how well they work, says Dr Pascal Vallotton. \\"Up to now they were counting the number of hairs that survived after treatment by hand. That's hard work and it's difficult because you may count a hair twice or you may miss it.\\" he said. The software relies on images captured by a small flatbed scanner  pressed onto the skin. Using a mathematical algorithm , the software then identifies and traces each individual hair based on an understanding of a hair's unique features, such as its   straightness.  The software is able to distinguish between hairs and other features on the skin such as wounds or moles .  \\"Our skin irregularities  make it difficult to say this is a hair or this is a mole,\\" Dr Vallotton said.  Comparison between earlier and later images can also determine if hair is growing quickly or slowly, he says. Unfortunately, to check the accuracy of the software, the researchers still had to adopt the old-fashioned method of counting hairs, helped by volunteers from neighboring labs who put their skins on the line for science. \\"We had 12 volunteers, mostly from neighboring labs, and we acquired images of hair before and after treatment,\\" Dr Vallotton said. To ensure an accurate count, the individual hairs had to be marked off as they were counted, but after such a laborious process, the researchers were pleased to discover the software results were comparable to the manual  count.

Definition: Given a math problem with context and a question and 5 answer choices, the task is to provide the correct answer choice based on the problem. You must choose one of the given answer choices by letter: a, b, c, d, or e; anything else is invalid. Input: Problem: a and b together can complete a piece of work in 10 days. if a alone can complete the same work in 15 days, in how many days, in how many days can b alone complete that work ? Options: a. 10, b. 30, c. 25, d. 15, e. 45 Output:","output":"b To find the answer, I used the definition provided which states that I need to choose the correct answer choice based on the problem. The problem tells me that a and b together can complete work in 10 days and a alone can complete the work in 15 days. I need to find the number of days b alone can complete the work. Using this information, I used the concept of work rates: 1. Work rate of (a + b) = 1 work / 10 days 2. Work rate of a = 1 work / 15 days To find the work rate of b, I can subtract the work rate of a from the work rate of (a + b): Work rate of (b) = (1 work / 10 days) - (1 work / 15 days) To perform the subtraction, I can find a common denominator of the fractions, which is 30: Work rate of (b) = (3 work / 30 days) - (2 work / 30 days) Work rate of (b) = (3 - 2) work / 30 days Work rate of (b) = 1 work / 30 days This is the work rate of b. Since b can complete 1 work in 30 days, the correct answer choice is b which is 30."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

What is the subject line for this email? Here's the latest Tino-gram: 1. Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs. 2. The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant  as well as the pipeline. The power plant could be located on Isleta land  adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation. Thus, the power  plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without  ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land. PNM would not be necessary to move  power to DOE. Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant  optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power. (maybe  this  could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia  reservation?) 3. Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex  Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill  Richardson at DOE. My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship  with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective. Tino reports  that \\"DOE is OK with the deal\\" and the next step is negotiating the power  contract itself. Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the  project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly  thin. It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery  promised DOE. 4. Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says  he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen. Tino thinks he's  working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big  power plant out there. Is this ours? PNM's? El Paso? Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics. Based on what Tino  told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of  how much  might be in this deal. They are groping a bit and our initial  analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight. How are those  efforts coming? Thanks.

Answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall.

He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood.  Which parent had more plaques that could potentially block blood flow?  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Dan, Bob's dad, had very high cholesterol levels. Since high cholesterol is a major factor in the development of atherosclerosis and plaque formation on the arterial walls, it can be concluded that Dan is more likely to have more plaques that could potentially block blood flow compared to Mary, who has normal cholesterol levels.

Note that a recent reform by the Real Academia Española (the governing body for the Spanish language) removed the accent from \\"solo,\\" so the correct form is \\"solo\\" even when it means \\"only\\". 2) \\"Fill in\\": The English phrasal verb \\"fill in\\" is translated as \\"llena\\", in this context which is the singular, informal command form of the verb \\"llenar\\" (to fill). 3) \\"Our\\": This is a possessive adjective, and it translates to \\"nuestro\\" when the noun it modifies is masculine singular (like \\"formulario\\").  4) \\"Application form\\": The compound noun \\"application form\\" could be translated either as \\"formulario de aplicación\\" or \\"formulario de solicitud\\". It's worth noting that the specific usage can vary between different Spanish-speaking regions. Yet, both expressions are commonly understood across the Spanish speaking world. In this case, I have used \\"formulario de aplicación.\\" So piecing it all together, \\"Just fill in our application form\\" is translated into Spanish as \\"Solo llena nuestro formulario de aplicación\\". This is a perfect literal translation where every English word corresponds to a Spanish word. It's also correct when it comes to Spanish grammar, punctuation, and as a result conveys the exact meaning of the original English sentence."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Aristotle and Plato were both what while living?\\" is in \\"Aristotle of Stagira, the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity.

Chicago Cubs Despite trading for pitcher Matt Garza and signing free-agent slugger Carlos Peña, the Cubs finished the 2011 season 20 games under .500 with a record of 71-91. Weeks after the season came to an end, the club was rejuvenated in the form of a new philosophy, as new owner Tom Ricketts signed Theo Epstein away from the Boston Red Sox, naming him club President and giving him a five-year contract worth over 18 million, and subsequently discharged manager Mike Quade. Epstein, a proponent of sabremetrics and one of the architects of two world series titles in Boston brought along Jed Hoyer to fill the role of GM and hired Dale Sveum as manager. Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966) it was largely expected. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired in May, followed by Ryan Dempster and Geovany Soto being traded to Texas at the All-Star break for a group of minor league prospects headlined by Christian Villanueva. The development of Castro, Anthony Rizzo, Darwin Barney, Brett Jackson and pitcher Jeff Samardzija as well as the replenishing of the minor-league system with prospects such as Javier Baez, Albert Almora, and Jorge Soler became the primary focus of the season, a philosophy which the new management said would carry over at least through the 2013 season.

Summarize this article: Lewis Crawford (R) gets some help from wrecker driver Terrance Lezama after his vehicle was stranded by freeway flooding as heavy rains hit Houston, Texas January 9, 2012.      WASHINGTON For the nearly 5 million people who live along the U.S. coasts from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico and the West Coast, rising seas fueled by global warming have doubled the risk of so-called once-a-century floods, according to a trio of environmental reports released on Wednesday.      These new reports - one from the non-profit group Climate Central and two others published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters - offer a detailed picture of where the most severe risks are along coastlines of the contiguous 48 states.      Based on 2010 U.S. Census population data and a fresh analysis of high tide lines by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Climate Central report's findings can be seen online at surgingseas.org      South Florida may be \\"indefensible\\" against floods caused by higher seas and the bigger storm surges that are expected to result, said Ben Strauss, an expert on ecology and evolutionary biology who is chief operating officer of Climate Central. He co-authored the two journal reports and the online report.      An estimated 30 billion in taxable property is vulnerable in southeast Florida alone, according to a preliminary independent analysis cited in the report.      In California, some places that have never seen severe floods could be vulnerable to them in the next decade or two, Strauss said.      Climate scientists maintain that people, businesses and infrastructure in low-lying coastal areas of the contiguous 48 U.S. states are vulnerable to sea level rise, and world sea levels have risen by 8 inches since 1880.      This rise in the world's seas is caused by the expansion of ocean waters as they warm and by the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, Strauss said. This is due to global warming fueled by the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, he and other climate scientists have said.      Forecasts for sea level rise this century range from 2 to 7 feet, with most estimates centering around 3 to 4 feet, given a projected rise in global temperature of at least 2 to 3 degrees F (1.1 to 1.6 degrees C), Strauss said.      VULNERABLE ZONES      As seas rise, they amplify storm surges, the reports said.      Global warming will more than double the odds of once-a-century floods by 2030 for more than two-thirds of the 55 coastal locations considered in the analysis, the Climate Central report said. For a majority of the locations, warming triples the odds of century floods.      By 2030, storm surges combined with rising seas could raise waters to 4 feet or more above high tide lines at many locations, the reports said, noting that 4.9 million people live in 2.6 million homes in this vulnerable zone between the observed high tide and the top of expected flood waters.      Cities are likely to be hit hardest, Strauss said, with 90 percent of the impact projected to come in areas with extremely dense population.      In 285 coastal cities and towns, more than half the population lives below the 4-foot mark, the Climate Central report found. Florida has 106 of these at-risk municipalities; Louisiana has 65, New Jersey and North Carolina have 22 each, Maryland has 14, New York has 13 and Virginia has 10.      Florida is a special case because in addition to rising seas and storm surges, its geology and system of drainage canals pose complex problems. \\"Basically, south Florida in the long term is indefensible,\\" Strauss said.      \\"A lot of the state is built on porous bedrock, bedrock that's like Swiss cheese,\\" he said. \\"You can't practically build a wall to keep the sea out. The water will come up through the ground.\\"      To prepare for the future, he said, researchers looked to the past, and compared current flooding patterns to what occurred before sea levels rose 8 inches, starting in 1880.      \\"Today's century storm would be a once-in-200- or 300-year event, or rarer if there had been no sea level rise from global warming over the last century,\\" Strauss said. \\"The point is, we're already in the teeth of this.\\"      (Editing by Eric Beech) ||||| Climate Central, of Princeton, N.J., was started in 2008 with foundation money to conduct original climate research and also to inform the public about the work of other scientists. For the sea level project, financed entirely by foundations, the group is using the Internet to publish an extensive package of material that goes beyond the scientific papers, specifying risks by community. People can search by ZIP code to get some idea of their own exposure.      While some coastal governments have previously assessed their risk, most have not, and national-level analyses have also been rare. The new package of material may therefore give some communities and some citizens their first solid sense of the threat.      Dr. Strauss said he hoped this would spur fresh efforts to prepare for the ocean’s rise, and help make the public more aware of the risks society is running by pumping greenhouse gases into the air. Scientists say those gases are causing the planet to warm and its land ice to melt into the sea. The sea itself is absorbing most of the extra heat, which causes the water to expand and thus contributes to the rise.      The ocean has been rising slowly and relentlessly since the late 19th century, one of the hallmark indicators that the climate of the earth is changing. The average global rise has been about eight inches since 1880, but the local rise has been higher in some places where the land is also sinking, as in Louisiana and the Chesapeake Bay region.      The rise appears to have accelerated lately, to a rate of about a foot per century, and many scientists expect a further acceleration as the warming of the planet continues. One estimate that communities are starting to use for planning purposes suggests the ocean could rise a foot over the next 40 years, though that calculation is not universally accepted among climate scientists.      The handful of climate researchers who question the scientific consensus about global warming do not deny that the ocean is rising. But they often assert that the rise is a result of natural climate variability, they dispute that the pace is likely to accelerate, and they say that society will be able to adjust to a continuing slow rise.

Myron Ebell, a climate change skeptic at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group, said that “as a society, we could waste a fair amount of money on preparing for sea level rise if we put our faith in models that have no forecasting ability.”      Experts say a few inches of sea level rise can translate to a large incursion by the ocean onto shallow coastlines. Sea level rise has already cost governments and private landowners billions of dollars as they have pumped sand onto eroding beaches and repaired the damage from storm surges.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Insurance companies got out of the business of writing flood insurance decades ago, so much of the risk from sea level rise is expected to fall on the financially troubled National Flood Insurance Program, set up by Congress, or on state insurance pools. Federal taxpayers also heavily subsidize coastal development when the government pays to rebuild infrastructure destroyed in storm surges and picks up much of the bill for private losses not covered by insurance.      For decades, coastal scientists have argued that these policies are foolhardy, and that the nation must begin planning an orderly retreat from large portions of its coasts, but few politicians have been willing to embrace that message or to warn the public of the rising risks.      Organizations like Mr. Ebell’s, even as they express skepticism about climate science, have sided with the coastal researchers on one issue. They argue that Congress should stop subsidizing coastal development, regarding it as a waste of taxpayers’ money regardless of what the ocean might do in the future.      “If people want to build an expensive beach house on the Florida or Carolina coast, they should take their own risk and pay for their own insurance,” Mr. Ebell said.      The new research calculates the size of the population living within one meter, or 3.3 feet, of the mean high tide level, as estimated in a new tidal data set from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In the lower 48 states, that zone contains 3.7 million people today, the papers estimate, a figure exceeding 1 percent of the nation’s population.      Under current coastal policies, the population and the value of property at risk in that zone are expected to continue rising.      The land below the 3.3-foot line is expected to be permanently inundated someday, possibly as early as 2100, except in places where extensive fortifications are built to hold back the sea. One of the new papers calculates that long before inundation occurs, life will become more difficult in the low-lying zone because the rising sea will make big storm surges more likely. ||||| Summary:","output":"A group of environmental reports states that global warming has caused the risk of once-a-century floods to double for the 5 million people living along the US coasts of Maine, the Gulf of Mexico and the West Coast.

Here is a news article: MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone for the first time on Monday, agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries, according to a statement from the Kremlin.      The two agreed “on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations,” said the statement, and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts “to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues.”      The issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism. Mr. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Mr. Trump last Wednesday, sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor, but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously. Mr. Putin repeated the congratulations over the phone.      The Russian president said he hoped that Moscow could build a “collaborative dialogue” with Washington on the bases of “equality, mutual respect and noninterference in the other’s internal affairs,” the release said. ||||| Other prominent experts who endorsed the report included Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant defense secretary under President Ronald Reagan; Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell; Chas W. Freeman Jr., a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and assistant defense secretary for international affairs; and Gary Sick, a Columbia University scholar who served on the National Security Council under Reagan as well as Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.      The nuclear deal relaxed many economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for reductions in its nuclear efforts and verifiable pledges to keep that work peaceful.      Critics of the agreement said Iran was an untrustworthy partner and had been granted too many concessions.      How easily — or even whether — Mr. Trump can make good on his promise to renegotiate or scrap the agreement remains unclear. It was negotiated among Iran and six major powers including the United States, and was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.      The countries who joined the United States in signing the deal — Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — have said they intend to honor the agreement, which would isolate the United States should it withdraw, and would weaken the effect of any unilateral American sanctions.      On Monday, European Union ministers added their endorsement of the agreement.      The agreement, which officially took effect in January, has released hundreds of millions of dollars in impounded Iranian funds and spurred a rush of European business interest in Iran trade and investment deals, generating momentum that would be difficult to reverse.      Should the pact collapse, Iran would presumably be free to develop nuclear weapons, an outcome that many nations, including Iran’s Middle East neighbors, say would destabilize the region.      Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the agreement would also put him at odds with Russia, risking new tensions after vowing to improve Washington’s relationship with Moscow. ||||| Anti-Trump and pro-Trump signs compete outside Trump Tower in New York. Demonstrations have continued in cities across the country in protest of Donald Trump’s rhetoric and personnel choices. (Jewel Samad/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)      President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a telephone conversation Monday that relations between their countries were “unsatisfactory” and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement.      Moscow said the two men discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about “a settlement for the crisis in Syria” and agreed that their aides would begin working on a face-to-face meeting between them.      Trump’s office later said that Putin had called to “offer his congratulations” and that they had discussed shared threats and challenges, “strategic economic issues” and the long-term relationship between the two nations.      On Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesman said that Putin and Trump had not discussed the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 or the rebellion by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.      “The overall tone of the conversation corresponded with the tone of statements already made during [Trump’s] election campaign concerning Russian-American relations,” the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \\"drain the swamp\\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)      During the campaign, Trump said that he “would look at” recognizing Crimea as a part of Russia. The United States and the European Union issued sanctions on Russia over Crimea, and broadened them as a result of Moscow’s involvement in eastern Ukraine.      The president-elect spoke admiringly of Putin during the campaign, praising him as a stronger leader than President Obama and saying the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria.      Those views put Trump at odds with many GOP defense hawks, who have praised his promise to increase military spending but are uniformly suspicious of Moscow and have denounced Russian actions in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Syria. The offer of cooperation could also immerse Trump in a deep controversy with the Pentagon, where military and civilian leaders have strongly opposed collaboration with Russia, particularly in Syria.      U.S. intelligence officials have also expressed concern, noting that the Kremlin is believed to have been involved with hacking the email accounts of prominent Democrats, in hopes of injecting chaos into the U.S. electoral process and perhaps swaying the outcome of the vote.      Trump’s conversations with Putin and other world leaders came as protests continued for a sixth straight day in major cities and on college campuses over last week’s election results, in which Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.      [Trump called these foreign leaders the day after the election]      He also faced escalating criticism over his appointment of former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist at the White House. Bannon has been denounced by a chorus of advocacy groups, commentators and congressional Democrats as a proponent of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views.      “Bringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said in a statement. “There must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump Administration.” Trump allies have dismissed the accusation.      Obama, in his first news conference since the election, declined to comment on Bannon and sought to reassure the country and the international community that Trump is committed to governing in a more realistic and pragmatic fashion than he displayed on the campaign trail. Obama said Trump pledged in their conversation last week to maintain U.S. strategic relationships, including the NATO alliance.      At the same time, Obama urged the president-elect to reach out to groups representing minorities and women, many of whom have felt slighted by his candidacy.      “One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the president, obviously, is the leader of the executive branch, the commander in chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the president. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships,” Obama said. “. . . And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue.”      Trump has signaled in numerous ways that he will not hew to many of the norms of past presidents, from declining to release his tax returns to relying on his family as key advisers. Previously, he has said he would avoid conflicts of interest as president by turning his business over to his children.      [Trump’s win may just be the beginning of a global populist wave]      Since his victory last week, Trump has received congratulatory calls from a number of foreign leaders, including some he sharply criticized during the presidential race, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Sunday night, after he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump’s office said that he “believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward.”      Trump’s relationship with Russia may be one of his trickiest to navigate.      Although the statement released by his office contained few details and did not mention Syria or other specific issues, it said Trump told Putin “that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the People of Russia.”      In addition to praising Putin, Trump has indicated that closer relations with Russia would keep the Kremlin from establishing tighter ties with China. He has appeared to absolve Russia from responsibility for intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, and during the campaign repeatedly questioned the relevance of NATO, which has charged Moscow with engaging in provocative air and sea actions on the alliance’s eastern flank.      Giving Putin a free pass on those issues would run directly counter to the Russia policy of the Obama administration, which has, among other things, called for an international war-crimes investigation of Russia’s actions in Syria. It could also undermine current European negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine, as well as support for U.S. and European Union sanctions.      Russia is interested not only in getting the sanctions removed but also in obtaining equal status as a player in the Middle East and elsewhere.      Moscow is the primary supporter, along with Iran, of President Bashar al-Assad. In September 2015, one year after the United States began bombing Islamic State targets in Syria, Putin ordered Russian jets into operation against “terrorist” targets there.      Most Russian airstrikes, however, have targeted U.S.-backed opposition forces fighting against Assad and, according to the United Nations, have killed hundreds of civilians. The United States and its European allies have called for an international investigation of Russia for war crimes.      Obama administration offers to coordinate U.S. counterterrorism strikes against the Islamic State in Syria with Russia, if the Russians would stop bombing opposition and civilian targets, have repeatedly failed to stop the carnage. Any cooperation with Russia would also put the United States on the side of Iran, whose activities in the region Trump has vowed to stop.      Also controversial was Trump’s decision Sunday to name Bannon as chief strategist, a move condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Capitol Hill Democrats and some Republican Trump critics.      Trump’s staff brushed off the criticism Monday, saying Bannon is a former naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive who has been a measured voice behind the scenes at the campaign.      “That’s not the Steve Bannon that I know, and I’ve spent a lot of time with him,” Trump’s new chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on MSNBC, responding to allegations of racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism. “. . . He was a force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw, all the time.”      Kellyanne Conway, who worked closely with Bannon as Trump’s campaign manager, also defended him. “He’s been the general of this campaign,” she told reporters as she arrived Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with the president-elect.      Asked whether Bannon needed to explain his connections to the alt-right movement, which includes many white nationalists and white supremacists, Conway said: “I’m personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not — 56 million-plus Americans or so saw something else. . . . You should really focus on the will of the people, which was to elect Donald Trump the president.”      House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) sought to calm the fears many Americans still hold about Trump’s election.      “There is a lot of hysteria and hyperbole,” Ryan said during an interview Monday with his hometown radio station, 1380 Big AM in Janesville, Wis. “I would tell people to just relax — things are going to be fine.

Those who encounter this evil supernatural force die; and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passed from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order; the original film is presented in a non-linear narrative. The Saeki family lived happily in suburban Tokyo, but housewife Kayako Saeki fell in love with her college professor, Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in her diary. However, her husband Takeo discovered the diary. Believing Kayako was having an affair, he became mentally disturbed and murdered his wife by pushing her off the stairs, snapping her neck to a 90 degree angle and crushing her throat. He then drowned his young son Toshio - who witnessed the act - in the bathtub to cover his tracks, along with the pet cat, Mar. Takeo hid the bodies in the attic and closet, before Kayako's ghost murdered him by hanging him with her hair in Toshio's bedroom. Peter came to the Saeki house to speak to Kayako after receiving a letter from her, only to find her corpse. Shocked, he fled the house, killing himself the next day by falling over the balcony of his building complex in front of his wife. The Saeki family rose again as ghosts due to their rage and sorrow, notably Kayako, who appears as an onryÅ ghost, leaving the curse on the house. The present timeline starts a few years later with the Williams family moving in from America. While husband Matt is thrilled with the house, his wife Jennifer and dementia-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable. Jennifer is quickly consumed by the curse. Matt returns home to find the house trashed, Emma upset, and his wife dying. Matt and Jennifer are killed by Toshio.

When King Alexander III ruled Scotland, his reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability. On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse. The heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway. As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians. Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney on 26 September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the \\"Great Cause\\", with several families laying claim to the throne. With Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King Edward I of England was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as Lord Paramount of Scotland. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed, judgement was given in favour of John Balliol having the strongest claim in law. Edward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. John was a weak king, known as \\"Toom Tabard\\" or \\"Empty Coat\\". John renounced his homage in March 1296 and by the end of the month Edward stormed Berwick-upon-Tweed, sacking the then-Scottish border town. In April, the Scots were defeated at the Battle of Dunbar in East Lothian and by July, Edward had forced John to abdicate. Edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles . Based on the above article, answer a question.

The free Pirate's Show at Treasure Island came to mind as I have seen it at least a dozen times. Honestly, I won't waste my time to see it again.  Embarrassingly bad and cringe inducing. What they heck did they do to the Pirates show that we all used to love? It is just awful and non-watchable now.  Hey, I am the first to admit I like free, cheesy, campy, kitschy stuff. That's why it pains me to hate on this show. Sure, the girl pirates look hot, but the guy pirates seem like effeminate douches now, the piped in music is lame that they lip sync to, and the crowds are always annoying. Even last year when I walked by as the show was going on I just did not even bother to look. It also gets too crowded, and you need to get there early to secure a good spot to view one of the multiple shows each night. Halfway through you wonder why you wasted your time when it could have been better spent seeing something else on the strip.  It's just not worth it anymore. The older show with the pirates battling the British Empire ship was so much more fun. This is like watching the staff of a local Hooters try to act out Shakespeare - and failing miserably.

Quickly forgetting about his discovery, he joins a newly transferred detective named Stan Johnson (Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson) trying to end a conflict involving looters. Post-Katrina, Andy and Stan are now partners. They work with corrupt detectives Pepe (Jose Pablo Cantillo) and Barney (Brian Presley), who are caught up in the murder of an undercover narcotics agent. Investigating the escalating police corruption in New Orleans is FBI Agent Brown (Michael Biehn). Brown brings up his thoughts to Police Captain Friendly (Barry Shabaka Henley) who insists he is doing his best to solve the problems in his department. Meanwhile, police therapist Nina Ferraro (Sharon Stone) tries to help the detectives with their struggles, with little avail. She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty. Things are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew. Brown tells Andy that he has an informant who is leaking out the details, and Andy, disbelieving at first, begins to resign himself to the fact that one of his men is betraying him. After Captain Friendly is assassinated by a local gangster named Chamorro, Andy, Stan, Pepe, and Barney decide to take the law into their own hands and go after Chamorro. While interrogating Chamorro, they find out that Brown has been supplying the drug dealer with information about the police raids, to help his own investigation. In a violent shootout, Barney accidentally shoots and kills Pepe. Andy and Stan escape, only to return to the warehouse where they met. There Andy realizes that Stan is the informant. After the two start arguing, Brown shows up and there is another shootout, ending in Brown's death. Andy comforts a sobbing Stan, then Andy kills his partner, as he possibly did with his previous one. The film ends on a low note, leaving no premise...

Hint: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is clear that both Jenny and Josh have an increased risk of developing different types of cancers due to their viral infections. However, focusing specifically on the risk of developing skin cancer, Jenny, who is infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), has a higher risk compared to her brother Josh, who is infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Human papillomaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause different types of cancers, including skin cancer. In particular, certain types of HPV have been linked to the development of squamous cell carcinoma, which is a common form of skin cancer. It is important to note that not all HPV types are associated with skin cancer; there are over 100 different types of HPV, and some cause benign skin warts or other non-cancerous conditions. However, specific high-risk HPV types are more strongly associated with squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, as well as cancers of the cervix, anus, and penis. On the other hand, Josh's Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with several types of cancers, but these are primarily lymphomas and carcinomas not involving the skin. While EBV-induced cancers can be serious and even life-threatening, the virus does not have a direct link to the development of skin cancer. Instead, EBV is more commonly associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In conclusion, based on the details provided, Jenny, who is infected with human papillomavirus, has a higher risk of developing skin cancer compared to her brother Josh, whose Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with various lymphomas and carcinomas but not directly linked to skin cancer. It is essential for both siblings to maintain regular medical check-ups and follow their healthcare provider's advice to manage their respective infections and minimize the risk of developing these associated cancers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sterling loses another bid to stop Clippers sale LOS ANGELES — An appellate court caught in an extraordinary legal snafu refused Friday to consider Donald Sterling’s request to block the 2 billion sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer but said he could file it again. In a purely procedural move, Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas withdrew his final statement of decision in the probate case between Sterling and his estranged wife Shelly Sterling over the impending sale of the team. “The petition is denied without prejudice to re-filing at the appropriate time in that presently there is nothing for this court to review,” said the three-judge appellate panel in a ruling issued late Friday. The reason was a series of miscommunications between the judge and the lawyers for Donald Sterling who had asked on Thursday for more time to file objections to his ruling. Having heard no response by noon Friday, they filed their request for a writ of mandate overturning the judge’s decision. But three hours later, Levanas withdrew his decision and gave them until next Wednesday to file their objections, said Stephen Smith, a member of Shelly Sterling’s legal team. The end result is that Friday’s events were a dress rehearsal for a legal drama likely to be concluded next week. Donald Sterling’s lawyers will file their objections. The judge will write his final statement of decision with or without changes and the lawyers will then go to the appellate court, Smith said. He acknowledged it was all quite confusing. “This case certainly has a lot of moving parts,” Smith said. Earlier, when Donald Sterling’s writ request was filed, Ballmer’s lawyer quickly denounced the move. Lawyers for Sterling had asked the Second District Court of Appeal to stay Levanas’ ruling that cleared the way for the sale. They said the judge prematurely finalized his ruling so the sale can be completed without a chance to appeal. Sterling’s appellate lawyers said in their request for a writ of mandate that if the sale goes through, “Donald will have lost a unique and irretrievable asset: a ‘trophy asset’ coveted by high net worth individuals around the world — one of thirty NBA franchises in the country, and one that under Donald’s thirty-year ownership has recently become one of the most successful.” The main complaint of the appellants is the judge’s decision to allow the sale to go forward with no time for an appeal. He used a section of law that bars a stay of his decision. Given that provision, it was unclear if the appeal would have any effect. The sale could conceivably go forward while the appeal makes its way through the courts. Adam Streisand, the attorney for Ballmer, said in a statement: “We won this trial because Donald Sterling is on an egotistical crusade to destroy the Clippers if he can’t keep the team, and he can’t. We will win the appeal for the very same reason.” A spokesman for the attorneys representing Shelly Sterling issued a statement similarly attacking Donald Sterling’s motives. “Donald’s petition for writ of mandate is another desperate act by a desperate man,” the statement said. “The decision by Judge … Levanas — after three weeks of trial — is a correct decision on the law and the undisputed evidence. Donald will do anything to kill the record-shattering 2B sale of the Clippers. His petition is frivolous.” The petition is denied without prejudice to re-filing at the appropriate time in that presently there is nothing for this court to review. - Three judges' decision The appellate lawyers who filed the writ petition late Friday afternoon acknowledged that Donald Sterling has a public image problem. “Admittedly, in light of recent events, Donald Sterling does not cut a sympathetic figure,” his appellate lawyers wrote. “But the issues raised by the trial court’s decision here impact more than just him, and involve core issues of probate law and the right to appellate review.” Shelly Sterling negotiated the record sale after the NBA banned the 80-year-old billionaire for making offensive remarks about blacks. “The nature of the trial court’s order all but guarantees that this court will never review this matter by appeal,” the lawyers said. “lf the sale of the Clippers is not stayed, the team is likely to be sold before any appeal could be brought or decided, rendering Donald’s appeal rights hollow. This is a textbook example of irreparable harm, and cries out for writ relief.” The writ filed by the Donald Sterling legal team demanded an immediate stay of the judge’s ruling. It said that in the absence of a stay, the sale could go forward immediately. It noted that the NBA plans to meet on Aug. 15 to approve the sale. Addressing the ruling by Levanas, the document said his action “was unreasonable, arbitrary, a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and manifestly against the law.” The 39-page filing challenged the opinions of two doctors who examined Donald Sterling and who said he had the beginnings of Alzheimer’s disease, rendering him incompetent to handle his own business affairs. The filing said the examinations were “insufficient to support a determination of incapacity” and said Shelly Sterling improperly removed her estranged husband as a trustee of the Sterling family trust.

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A group of grifters rip off their latest mark and celebrate, while de facto leader of the group Jake Vig (Edward Burns) explains the art of the con. When one of the four (Louis Lombardi) is found shot to death, the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. crime lord called The King (Dustin Hoffman). Jake proposes that the grifters work for the King and steal money from Morgan Price (Robert Forster), a rival who owns a bank. Jake enlists the aid of his remaining partners, Gordo (Paul Giamatti) and Miles (Brian Van Holt), and also convinces an independent con artist named Lily (Rachel Weisz) to round out their foursome. The King, a ruthless killer who suffers from ADHD, demands that one of his men, Lupus (Franky G), also come along. The con involves bribing a bank vice president into wiring money offshore. The plan hits a snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan (Andy GarcÃ­a) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years. Butan forces corrupt LAPD detectives Omar Manzano (Luis GuzmÃ¡n) and Lloyd Whitworth (Donal Logue) to switch their allegiance from Jake to him. After hearing about Butan's arrival, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con. He screams at Lily, making her walk out. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lily's help. The bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings it to Ontario Airport, where he is met by both Butan and The King's men, both sides after the 5 million in a duffle bag.

In response, President Obama reiterated the United States' commitment to the security of its Gulf allies, emphasizing that the deal would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Additionally, the President announced plans to enhance security cooperation with the GCC, which included new joint exercises and training opportunities, as well as the possibility of expediting arms sales and technology transfers. Key factors influencing the Gulf States' satisfaction 1. A Nuclear-free Iran: The primary concern shared amongst the GCC member states is the potential for a nuclear-armed Iran. President Obama's assurances that the Iran Nuclear Deal would effectively prevent this outcome has likely played a significant role in easing concerns. Under the terms of the JCPOA, Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reduced by 98%, significantly delaying any potential production of nuclear weapons. 2. Continued US Military presence and support: President Obama's commitment to enhancing military cooperation and maintaining a strong US presence in the region has been viewed positively by the Gulf States. This US presence acts as a deterrent against any potential aggression from Iran, as well as other regional threats. 3. Encouraging a more moderate Iran: The lifting of sanctions has the potential to reshape Iran's political landscape, promoting a more moderate outlook as the country reintegrates into the global economy. This potential change in Iran's political climate could encourage a reduction in support for proxy conflicts in the region, which has been a key concern for the Gulf States. 4. Strengthening regional alliances: The Iran Nuclear Deal compelled regional stakeholders to analyze their relationships and consider the implications of a changing geopolitical landscape. Strengthening alliances among GCC member states and with global partners such as the United States is seen as a positive outcome of the deal, enhancing regional security and counterbalancing Iranian influence. Critics and Challenges Ahead Despite the assurances of the Obama administration, there are those who remain skeptical about the Iran Nuclear Deal and believe that it may reduce regional security. Critics argue that the agreement could embolden Iran, enabling it to increase its influence in the region through proxy conflicts, such as the ongoing situations in Yemen and Syria. Conclusion While the Iran Nuclear Deal initially fueled concerns amongst the Gulf States, the multiple assurances provided by President Obama have been well-received, alleviating considerable anxiety. The prospect of a nuclear-free Iran, the continuation of strong US presence in the region, and the potential for a more moderate political climate in Tehran, have collectively contributed to greater satisfaction and confidence amongst the Gulf States in the long-term prospects of the agreement. However, it remains crucial that the United States maintains its commitment to regional security and continues to engage with its Gulf allies, in order to ensure the stability and prosperity of the Middle East."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","output":"Sure, let's solve the given equation step by step: -32 = -1966*w + 1970*w First, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms (in this case, the terms involving 'w'): (1970*w - 1966*w) = -32 Now, remember the distributive property which states that a(b+c) = ab + ac. We can factor out 'w' from both terms in the parentheses: w(1970 - 1966) = -32 Calculating the subtraction inside the parentheses, we have: w(4) = -32 Now, in order to isolate 'w', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4: w = -32 / 4 Divide -32 by 4, and we get: w = -8 So, the solution to the equation -32 = -1966*w + 1970*w is w = -8."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sam saw popsicles and slushies, but she decided on the slushies because it can be sipped. Not only does sipping a slushy help keep you cool under the sweltering sun, but it also allows her to savor the experience. Sam approached the ice cream truck and scanned the colorful menu, full of delicious flavors to choose from. Sam knew that she had made the right choice, as a popsicle may melt too quickly in the heat, whereas a slushy can maintain its pleasing texture and provide much-needed relief from the oppressive heat. As she glanced at the menu, the vibrant combinations of red cherry, tangy blue raspberry, and sweet pineapple stood out to her. The ice cream truck operator greeted her with a friendly smile and asked her which flavor she wanted. Sam weighed her options, considering the vast array of flavors before her. The thought of an ice-cold slushy, packed with tantalizing fruity goodness, sent her taste buds into overdrive. After careful deliberation, she settled on a perfect combination: cherry and pineapple, the two flavors working together to create a delightful and refreshing concoction. The ice cream truck operator skillfully combined the slushy flavors, creating a unique, swirled design with a vibrant splash of colors. After handing over her crisp dollar bills and coins, Sam eagerly accepted her chilly treat and began sipping it through the provided straw. The first taste was a blast of tart cherry chased by the sweet, exotic notes of pineapple. It was a symphony of flavors, and the icy slush helped to combat the sweltering heat as it coated her parched throat. Sam spent the remainder of her time at the beach sipping on her slushy and watching the waves crash onto the shoreline. The cool sensation contrasted against the hot, sunny atmosphere, and it brought her a sense of contentment as she enjoyed her time outdoors. She watched children build sandcastles, families splashing in the water, and groups of friends chatting and laughing. As Sam finished her slushy, she couldn't help but feel grateful for the simple pleasure it brought her. In the midst of the hot beach day, it was a small oasis of bliss. It allowed her to relish every second she spent on the beach, without succumbing to the overwhelming heat. The slushy provided her with the opportunity to take a moment for herself and just savor the surroundings. With an empty cup and a happy heart, Sam's decision to choose the slushy over the popsicle proved to be a wise one. She continued her beach adventures feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, and she hoped to enjoy more delightful slushies in the future whenever the heat became too much to bear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Jillian Michaels on Sweating the Big Stuff Smaller\\"","output":"Title: Jillian Michaels on Sweating the Big Stuff Smaller Subtitle: How the Queen of Fitness tackles stress to help you achieve your goals Introduction In an age where stress seems to be an inevitable part of our lives, it is essential to find ways to manage it effectively. In recent years, Jillian Michaels--the renowned fitness expert and life coach, has shared her unique approach to conquering stress. Her philosophy focuses on breaking down seemingly insurmountable challenges into smaller, more approachable tasks, making them easier to handle. We will delve into her strategies and find out how you can apply them to your own life to \\"sweat the big stuff smaller.\\" Section 1: Assessing the Big Stuff Jillian Michaels believes that the key to tackling stress lies in being able to assess the true nature of the challenges you face accurately. She suggests dividing problems into three categories: minor irritations, moderate hassles, and significant stressors. By doing this, you gain a better understanding of the magnitude of the problem, allowing you to strategize your response. 1.1 Minor irritations These daily annoyances, such as a slow driver in the fast lane or a long line at the grocery store, may cause some stress, but they are often short-lived and manageable. Michaels advises not to give too much thought to these irritations, and most importantly, don't let them ruin your day. 1.2 Moderate hassles This category includes challenges that can interfere with your daily routine, such as an unexpected work deadline or a flat tire. They require more effort to address but should not be treated as insurmountable. Jillian suggests maintaining a sense of perspective when dealing with these hassles, reminding yourself that you have the ability to find a solution. 1.3 Significant stressors Here, you find the most critical issues that can potentially impact your life significantly, like the loss of a job or a serious medical diagnosis. Instead of letting these daunting challenges overwhelm you, Jillian encourages breaking them down into smaller tasks and taking them one step at a time. Section 2: Sweating the Big Stuff Smaller Michaels identifies three essential steps to manage stress effectively: 2.1 Prioritize The first step in conquering stress is to prioritize your tasks and responsibilities. Determine the most pressing issues and focus your efforts and resources on resolving them first. By doing this, you ensure that the most critical matters are attended to without being sidetracked by minor concerns. 2.2 Break it down To avoid becoming overwhelmed, break down your significant stressors into smaller, more manageable tasks. Michaels insists that this approach will help you maintain your momentum and stay on track with your goals. As you complete each task, you'll gradually chip away at the bigger problem and feel a sense of accomplishment. 2.3 Lean on your support system Jillian Michaels emphasizes the importance of relying on friends, family, and colleagues for help and support. Share your challenges with people you trust, and don't hesitate to ask them for advice or assistance. A strong support system can provide valuable resources, emotional reassurance, and perspective. Section 3: Attitude is Everything Jillian Michaels also highlights the significance of maintaining a positive attitude throughout the process. By focusing on the progress you're making and the smaller victories, you’ll remain motivated and confident in your ability to tackle the big stuff. 3.1 Give yourself credit Michaels encourages individuals to celebrate their accomplishments, no matter how small. Reflecting on your progress along the way can help boost your self-confidence and fuel your continued efforts. 3.2 Don't neglect self-care Lastly, Jillian reminds us of the importance of self-care during times of stress. Caring for yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally will help build resilience and enable you to face challenges with a clearer mind and a more positive outlook. Conclusion Jillian Michaels' philosophy of sweating the big stuff smaller is a valuable approach to managing stress in our lives. By categorizing your challenges, prioritizing your tasks, breaking down significant stressors, and maintaining a positive attitude, you can conquer stress and achieve your goals. Remember, the key is taking incremental steps, celebrating progress, and leaning on your support system. With these tools in your arsenal, you'll be better prepared to tackle the big stuff, while keeping stress to a minimum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is While some researchers sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way,[page needed] and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens, and subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens. a good answer to this question?","output":"Answer: Yes, the statement provided does address the question, \\"What do all living humans belong to?\\" but could be improved in terms of clarity and comprehensiveness. The statement acknowledges the debate around the concept of race and its use in scientific research, and establishes the fact that all living humans belong to the Homo sapiens species and Homo sapiens sapiens subspecies. Here's an expanded and revised version of the statement to better answer the question: All living humans belong to the Homo sapiens species and the Homo sapiens sapiens subspecies. The concept of race has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars, primarily because some employ the concept of race to make distinctions among human populations based on a range of traits like physical appearance, ancestry, and genetics. However, many in the scientific community argue that the idea of race is often employed in a naive or simplistic manner, as it may not accurately represent complex genetic variations and population structures observed in human populations. These critics of racial categorization emphasize that racial distinctions often lack taxonomic significance, meaning that the concept of race may not provide sound scientific bases for classification. They maintain that it is essential to recognize our shared humanity and shared genetic heritage as a single species and subspecies. This view aligns with the overarching scientific consensus that all living humans are members of the Homo sapiens species, which emerged in Africa roughly 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. The Homo sapiens sapiens subspecies, often referred to as anatomically modern humans (AMH), arose approximately 50,000 to 70,000 years ago and encompasses all living humans today regardless of their ethnicity or geographical origins. In conclusion, while the concept of race remains a contentious topic in human classification, it is widely accepted among scientists that all living humans belong to one species, Homo sapiens, and one subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens. This shared membership underscores the importance of focusing on our commonalities rather than on arbitrary distinctions, as well as fostering greater understanding and collaboration across different populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to federal prosecutors, the United Airlines (“UA”) call center (based in Detroit, MI) received an anonymous phone call from a woman who claimed five “foreigners” posed a threat to a flight they were scheduled to board later that day. The woman identified the five French visitors as two men with whom she was acquainted, another woman, and two unidentified individuals. In response to questions from a UA operator, the caller explained that she had received a threatening text message, ostensibly from one of the men, which led her to believe that the group posed a threat. Deeming the caller’s tip credible, UA immediately contacted the authorities. The Transportation Security Administration confirmed the itineraries of the passengers identified for the flight in question; and the FBI initiated an investigation into the alleged terrorist threat. The UA operator advised the FBI that he believed that a bomb could be on the plane. Upon their arrival at Los Angeles International Airport (“LAX”), the fingered men were found by the FBI. In response to questioning, the men explained they had been vacationing in the U.S. since July 2011, during which time, one of them was involved in a romantic relationship with Lizet Sariol, 45, of Temple City, CA. The visitor ended his relationship with Sariol the night before, and he believed that she was so unhappy with that development, that she incriminated him and his companions. Thereafter, federal investigators allegedly determined that Sariol had sent a series of text messages telephonically and to the Facebook accounts of the men. In her messages, Sariol purportedly expressed her displeasure with the men’s actions toward her, and warned of her intention to report them to law enforcement. In fact, Sariol implied that she had already reported the men to the FBI and that she “hoped” they had good attorneys. Moreover, Sariol’s text messages suggested that her close ties with law enforcement would ensure the men would be arrested and prohibited from returning to the U.S. Specifically, federal prosecutors allege that one text message from Sariol stated: “Already called the airlines considered you all terrorists including annie,” Ultimately, FBI investigators determined the travelers implicated by Sariol did not pose a threat to the airline. Sariol allegedly admitted that some of her messages may have been a mistake and that anonymous phone call to UA was made in anger. On November 23, 2011, Sariol was charged in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles with providing false and misleading information; specifically, fabricating a terrorist threat to UA on September 25th, 2011. If convicted of the charge, Sariol faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison. NOTE: A criminal complaint contains allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in a court of law. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Lizet Sariol was charged with providing false and misleading information after falsely accusing her ex-boyfriend and his companions of being terrorists, leading to an FBI investigation and potential consequences for the innocent travelers; Sariol faces up to five years in federal prison if convicted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Ukraine not investigating bugged phone call between US diplomats Ukraine’s state security service said on Saturday it was not investigating the bugging of a phone call between US diplomats in which they weighed up which opposition leaders they should back for government in a reformed Ukraine. US diplomats tried to limit the damage on Friday, after audio of the phone conversation was posted on the internet. In it, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was heard using an expletive in reference to the European Union, saying: “Fuck the EU.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, already furious with Washington over reports that US officials bugged her own phone, found Nuland’s remarks “totally unacceptable”, her spokeswoman said. “The Ukrainian security service is not conducting any investigation into the matter at this time,” Maxim Lenko, a senior investigations official in the Ukrainian state security service, told a news conference in Kiev. Nuland has been Washington’s point person on Ukraine since a crisis broke in the former Soviet republic last November, bringing thousands of protesters out on to the streets of Kiev. The bugged phone call between Nuland and the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, was released as Nuland visited Kiev to put US ideas for ending the crisis to President Viktor Yanukovich. US officials have accused Russian intelligence of being behind a “dirty tricks” operation. Nuland on Friday laughed off the incident saying the bugging operation was “pretty impressive tradecraft”. She said she did not think it would rebound on relations with opposition leaders, with whom western governments are trying to work as part of efforts to end Ukraine’s crisis.

Please answer the following question: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's... Answer:","output":"Giacomo Puccini later expanded their original idea to include a third opera with mystic or religious tones. After completing the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, Puccini still lacked ideas for the other two works.

Q: Producers from the ABC did attempt to contact 'people familiar' with Zaky Mallah before they allowed him to ask a question on the panel program Q&A, however, they failed to review his recent social media posts. According to a report by the Department of Communications, attempts to contact Mr Mallah's associates were 'unsuccessful' so the program's producers chose to base their decision on three other factors- previous experiences with Mr Mallah, the advice of an ABC journalist and a review of a recent television appearance. It was decided 'he was not dangerous, would not be disruptive and would be a suitable audience member to ask a question'.A report from the Department of Communications found that producers from Q&A did attempt to contact people familiar with Zaky MallahHowever, they failed to identify explicit tweets he sent to female journalistsThe report found Mallah has made 'extensive media appearances' since his conviction for threatening ASIO officialsThe ABC's Board formally warned executive producer, Peter McEvoyThe board said Mallah should have been cut given his criminal backgroundMallah clashed with parliamentary secretary Steve Ciobo about citizenshipHe was the first Australian charged under anti-terror laws back in 2005   Question:_, in 2005, was cleared of terrorism related charges involving a suicide attack on a commonwealth building.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. Sent 2: A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. Sent 3: The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. Sent 4: The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Sent 5: Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. Sent 6: The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. Sent 7: The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Sent 8: Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Sent 9: Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. Sent 10: By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. Sent 11: The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. Sent 12: On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Sent 13: Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Sent 14: Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Sent 15: Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Here's a detailed guide for you: 1. Prepare Your Tools: You will need a few items: a soft brush such as a toothbrush or a specific shoe brush, a cloth or a sponge, water, and mild soap. A toothpick might be helpful for detailed cleaning. 2. Remove Loose Dirt: Start by knocking the soles of the shoes together outside to dislodge any large clumps of dirt. Be sure to do this far away from any entrance to avoid spreading the dirt around. 3. Dry Brushing: Next, take your dry brush and gently brush away as much of the remaining dirt as possible. Pay extra attention to the crevices in the soles of the shoes, as this is where dirt tends to accumulate. Remember to brush the entire surface of the shoe, not just the dirty areas.  4. Wet Cleaning: Mix your mild soap with warm water until suds form. Dampen your cloth or sponge in this mixture, but make sure it's not soaking wet, as large amounts of water can damage certain types of shoes. Rub the cloth or sponge gently on every area of the shoe, paying extra attention to the areas that are dirtiest. For the soles, you can use a bit more pressure and make sure that you clean all the crevices. 5. Toothpick Detailing: If after brushing and wiping there’s still dirt lodged into the small crevices of the soles, this is where a toothpick comes in handy. Use it to poke out the stubborn dirt. Do this gently to avoid harming the shoe material. 6. Rinse: Rinse your cloth or sponge with clean water, wring it out so it's not dripping, and wipe down your shoes to remove any soap residue. Again, avoid getting the shoes too wet. 7. Dry: Dry your shoes by patting them with a clean towel. Avoid scrubbing as this could potentially damage the material. Also, never put your shoes directly under a heat source to speed up the drying, as this can cause certain materials to warp or shrink. 8. Leave to Air-Dry: Finally, set your shoes down and let them air dry. This step can take several hours, so make sure you clean your shoes a decent time before you need to use them again. Remember, not all shoes are the same. Some may require different cleaning techniques. For example, suede shoes need to be cleaned differently than shoes made of canvas or leather. Always check the manufacturer's care instructions before cleaning your shoes. For stubborn dirt or difficult stains, it might be best to seek professional cleaning services or contact the shoe manufacturer for advice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Following a national plebiscite in July 1937, the new Constitution of Ireland  came into force on 29 December 1937. This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and called the state Ireland, or Éire in Irish. While Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution defined the national territory to be the whole island, they also confined the state's jurisdiction to the area that had been the Irish Free State. The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936. Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open. Diplomats were accredited to the king, but the president exercised all internal functions of a head of state. For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI who was only an \\"organ\\", that was provided for by statute law. Ireland remained neutral during World War II, a period it described as the Emergency. Ireland's link with the Commonwealth was terminated with the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and declared that the state was a republic. At the time, a declaration of a republic terminated Commonwealth membership. This rule was changed 10 days after Ireland declared itself a republic, with the London Declaration of 28 April 1949. Ireland did not reapply when the rules were altered to permit republics to join. Later, the Crown of Ireland Act was repealed in Ireland by the Statute Law Revision  Act 1962.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Explanation: Sanding the edges of wood is like smoothing a rough piece of paper. Would you use a sponge or a special smoothing machine? That's right, you would use a machine. So, for wood, we use a machine called a belt sander. This machine has sandpaper on it that moves very fast to make the wood smooth.  Now, why can't we use a rough edge of a sponge? Well, think about using the rough side of a sponge on a bumpy road. It's not going to make the road smooth, right? It's the same for wood - the sponge isn't strong enough to smooth it out.

There has, however, been interest among railroad operators in returning to DC use at higher voltages than previously used. At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle.

The 76-year-old icon has no plans to appear in films again after a career spanning five decades.      “Jack has — without fanfare — retired,” a well-placed Hollywood film insider confirmed to Radar.      “There is a simple reason behind his decision — it’s memory loss. Quite frankly, at 76, Jack has memory issues and can no longer remember the lines being asked of him.      PHOTOS: Jack Nicholson Flirts With Jennifer Lawrence      “His memory isn’t what it used to be.”      The three-time Academy Award winner has not worked since How Do You Know in 2010 starring Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson.      Tellingly, producers for the forthcoming film Nebraska had wanted him to play the key role of an aging, booze-addled father who makes the trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son in order to claim a million dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize.      The role ultimately went to Bruce Dern, after Nicholson advised the filmmakers that he was not interested, the source said.      PHOTOS: Jack Nicholson And Kevin Garnett At A Laker’s Game      Nicholson began his Hollywood career in the 1950s, first working as a gofer for animation legends William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at the MGM cartoon studio. He left soon after to pursue his dream to star on screen.      The New Jersey-native made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama The Cry Baby Killer, in 1958, playing the title role.      He’s best remembered for his Academy Award winning roles as Best Actor for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and for As Good as It Gets. He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1983 film Terms of Endearment.      Nicholson has been nominated for a record-setting 12 Oscars, eight for Best Actor and four for Best Supporting Actor, making him the most nominated male actor in Academy Awards history.      PHOTOS: Stars Who Have Been Arrested      “Jack has no intention of retiring from the limelight,” said the source, who noted his regular appearances on the Hollywood party circuit, court side at his beloved Lakers and his co-presentation of the Academy Award for Best Picture with First Lady Michelle Obama, earlier this year.      “He’s not retiring from public life, at all. He just doesn’t want a tribute,” added the insider. “He’s happy to tacitly join the retirees club like Sean Connery.” ||||| Has Easy Rider star Jack Nicholson decided to ride off into that sunset known as retirement?

Which team contributed to strengthening the soil?  The two teams took different approaches in reinforcing the highway embankment slopes when building segments of the interstate. Team A led by Chuck relied almost entirely on inspiration and good building materials therefore decreasing slope stability, while team B lead by Mike used nature as an ally by planting tens of thousands of trees and shrubs to prevent slope failures and moderate soil transpiration and evaporation.  Hint: The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.[2][3] The answer is:","output":"Team B lead by Mike"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - You take a tray - Add water into the tray - You insert the tray into a freezer - The water molecules begin to slow down - The water becomes ice - The ice cubes are ready.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose water surface solidifies in ice tray happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis in which the water surface solidifies in the ice tray does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of ice cube formation, ultimately leading to less ice cubes being made. To understand the connection, let's break down the process and analyze the changes caused by the perturbation. When the water surface solidifies in the process, it creates a layer of ice that restricts the normal progress of water molecules slowing down and forming ice. This phenomenon has several direct and indirect consequences on the process: 1. Direct effect: Slower heat transfer The solidified ice layer acts as a barrier between the colder air in the freezer and the water underneath. This layer of ice hinders the process of heat transfer from the water to the surrounding air, slowing down the cooling process. The water underneath the layer remains insulated and takes longer to cool, leading to less ice cubes being made in a given time compared to the unperturbed process. 2. Direct effect: Incomplete ice cube formation In an ice tray, the partitions are designed to separate the individual ice cubes. When a solidified water surface forms, it can prevent the water from reaching these partitions. As a result, the ice formed underneath the surface layer may not have clearly defined edges, leading to imperfect or incomplete ice cubes. In this case, the total number of individually usable ice cubes will be less compared to the normal process. 3. Indirect effect: Overfilling or spillage risk To ensure adequate water is available to form ice cubes under the layer, a user might overfill the ice tray to compensate for the solidified surface layer. However, this could lead to spillage during insertion into the freezer or while pulling the tray out. The spillage might reduce the water volume in the tray and affect the number of ice cubes formed. 4. Indirect effect: Increased energy consumption When a solidified ice surface forms in the tray, it prolongs the time required for the water to freeze completely. Consequently, the freezer needs to work harder and use more energy to maintain the low temperatures necessary for ice formation. Over time, this added energy consumption could lead to wear on the freezer components, indirectly affecting the efficiency of the ice-making process. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis in which the water surface solidifies in the ice tray does have a significant impact on the process of ice cube formation, both directly and indirectly. This phenomenon can lead to slower cooling, inadequate formation of ice cubes, increased risks of spillage, and higher energy consumption, ultimately resulting in fewer ice cubes being produced compared to the normal freezing process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Screeching Weasel is an American punk rock band originally from the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights, Illinois. The band was formed in 1986 by Ben Weasel and John Jughead. Since their formation, Screeching Weasel have broken up and reformed numerous times with numerous line-up changes. Ben Weasel has been the only constant member, though Jughead was present in every incarnation of the band until 2009. The band originally called themselves All Night Garage Sale but changed their name to Screeching Weasel, a variation of a name a friend had suggested, Screaming Otter, which was a reference to a T-shirt that read, \\"I'VE GOT A SCREAMING OTTER IN MY PANTS!\\". Shortly after their formation, Weasel decided that it was too difficult to play bass and sing at the same time, so Vince Vogel, who took the stage name \\"Vinnie Bovine\\" joined as the band's bassist. The band recorded their debut album, Screeching Weasel, in one night for 200 and released it on Chicago label Underdog Records in 1987.  In 1988, Bovine was fired from the band and was replaced with Warren Fischer, better known as Fish, and former member of the band Ozzfish. The band recorded their second studio album, Boogadaboogadaboogada!, which featured Weasel playing second guitar (he would later state that he only played on about a quarter of the songs) and made a name for themselves by opening a show for Operation Ivy at 924 Gilman Street. Steve Cheese was fired from the band shortly after the recording due to his unwillingness to tour outside of Chicago. He was replaced by Aaron Cometbus for two shows who then was replaced by Brian Vermin. Boogadaboogadaboogada! was released in late 1988 on Roadkill Records, a label formed by investor David Best and managed by Ben Weasel following an introduction of the two by producer Mass Giorgini.  After what Weasel described as a \\"disastrous\\" tour, Fish left the group and was replaced by Dan Schafer, originally nicknamed \\"Sewercap\\" and later renamed Danny Vapid. The new band members recorded an extended play entitled Punkhouse for Limited Potential Records soon after that. The band ended up recording four more songs in 1989 that were featured on compilations, featuring a second guitarist Doug Ward, who also joined the band for several live performances.

Question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

Answer:","output":"\\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" is a popular song from the 1960 British musical \\"Oliver!\\", with music and lyrics by Lionel Bart. The song is performed by the character Nancy, a complex and troubled young woman who is deeply involved with the main antagonist, Bill Sikes. Nancy's love for him, despite his abusive behavior, is portrayed in the lyrics and emotions of the song. In the original 1960 West End production of \\"Oliver!\\", the role of Nancy was played by Georgia Brown, who was the first to perform \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" on stage. Brown's performance made the song quite well-known, and her rendition is still remembered today. The first Broadway production of \\"Oliver!\\" took place in 1963, wherein Nancy was portrayed by actress and singer Georgia Brown once again, meaning Brown was responsible for introducing the song to both British and American audiences. In the 1968 film adaptation of \\"Oliver!\\", the character of Nancy was portrayed by Shani Wallis, an English actress, and singer. Consequently, Wallis is the one who sang \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" in the movie. Her performance of the song became one of the film's highlights and was instrumental in earning its Academy Award for Best Picture. Throughout the decades since its inception, \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" has been performed in numerous stage productions by various actresses, each bringing their unique touch to the song and the character of Nancy. Some notable actresses who have portrayed Nancy and sung \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" include: 1. Ruthie Henshall in the 1994 London Palladium revival. 2. Kerry Ellis in the BBC TV show \\"I'd Do Anything\\" in 2008, in which young talents competed to be cast as Nancy in a West End production. 3. Jodie Prenger, who won the \\"I'd Do Anything\\" competition and played Nancy in the 2009 West End production. 4. Leanne Jones in the 2011 UK tour of \\"Oliver!\\". 5. Samantha Barks, who played Nancy in the 2011 production at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. There have also been various concert and charity performances where singers, both professional and amateur, have showcased their renditions of \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\". As the song remains an important piece in the musical theater repertoire, it will likely continue to be performed by different artists for many years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? gaping plot holes sink this \` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .","output":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence appears to be negative. This can be assessed by examining the specific words and phrases used, as they contribute to the overall tone and feelings conveyed by the author towards the movie. Firstly, the phrase \\"gaping plot holes\\" suggests that the movie has significant flaws in its storyline, which the author thinks are difficult to ignore. This signals dissatisfaction and disappointment with the plot, highlighting a critical view of the movie. Secondly, the term \\"sub-standard thriller\\" further underlines the negative sentiment. The descriptor \\"sub-standard\\" implies that the movie does not meet the author’s expectations, and delivers a below-average performance for a thriller. This again communicates dissatisfaction with the movie, reinforcing the negative sentiment expressed earlier. Next, the choice of words \\"sink\\" and \\"drag\\" convey the idea that the movie is not only failing to meet the audience's expectation but is actively pulling down their enthusiasm. This use of metaphor presents the movie as a hindrance to enjoyment rather than a source of entertainment. The phrase \\"crush depth\\" refers to the deep-sea scenario where a submarine can be destroyed by the water pressure it is subjected to. In this context, the author metaphorically claims that the audience enthusiasm is being dragged down to such a low point that it is practically being crushed. This gives a strong sense of negativity. Considering all these elements together, it is evident that the sentiment of the movie review sentence is negative. The reviewer emphasizes that the movie is plagued with numerous issues that result in decreased audience enthusiasm, delivering a crushing blow to the overall enjoyment of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a figure of speech, what is something hinted or implied without being definitely stated?","output":"In figurative language or speech, when something is hinted at or implied without being expressly stated, it is termed as \\"Innuendo\\".  Innuendo is a communication technique and a figure of speech that involves implying or indirectly alluding to something, such as an idea, piece of information, or fact, without explicitly saying it. This is done via insinuation or suggestion, using cunning, clever or ambiguous language. The underlying message is intricately woven into the fabric of the conversation or discourse, allowing the speaker to convey their thoughts without actually voicing them directly.  Innuendos can be used for a variety of intents. Some people use innuendo to tactfully express criticism or disapproval, to indirectly persuade or influence others, or to subtly insert humor or irony into their speak. Political discourse and satirical works are two arenas where innuendo is frequently used to indirectly communicate contentious or sensitive subjects. However, it is important to tread carefully when using innuendo, as its suggestive and indirect nature can often lead to misunderstanding, misinterpretation, or even offense. A certain level of familiarity with the subject, conversational context, and shared understanding between the speaker and listener is crucial for innuendo to be effectively communicated and understood.  Moreover, innuendo also often plays a vital role in literary works, enhancing the depth and complexity of characters and dialogues and adding layers to plotlines. It's used frequently in different forms of literature to create suspense, develop alternative interpretations, and unveil revelations gradually. For example, in Shakespeare's plays, innuendo was often utilized to introduce sexual undertones, expressing the forbidden or risqué elements of affection and desire. In general, innuendo is a delicate yet powerful device in the realm of rhetoric and communication, capable of shaping the whole dynamic of a conversation or narrative. Its strength lies in its subtlety and the skill with which it is implanted and it persists to be a compelling feature of modern and traditional forms of communication and storytelling alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musial (, MOO-show). His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanislaw Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced \\"Stashu\\". Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice. He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season--a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27. With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions. New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.  National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine. Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players \\"who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats\\". Cobb went on to refer to Musial as \\"a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime.\\" In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, \\"Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio.\\"  The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.  The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team. Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city. The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.  Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader. In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader. The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972. what was this feat?","output":"Musial, a baseball player, did something amazing on May 2, 1954. He played in two different games on the same day, which is called a doubleheader. In the first game, he hit three home runs, and in the second game, he hit two more home runs. So, he hit a total of five home runs in both games. This was a big achievement, and he was the first person to ever do that in a doubleheader."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).  After reading the above, is \\"Ten\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many emperors made the trek to this city to pay homage to the Great Teacher?\\"?

News article: Bill Gates urges China's wealthiest to give to charity Bill Gates: 'Returns from investing in poor people are just as great as [returns] from investing in the business world.' Photograph: Mehdi Taamallah/AFP/Getty Images Bill Gates has urged China's extraordinarily wealthy business elite to shed its aversion to philanthropy and donate to the poor, a potent message in one of the world's most economically divided societies. \\"Only when we help poor people break away from destitution and illness can the whole world achieve sustainable development,\\" Gates wrote in the People's Daily, a mouthpiece of the country's top leadership. \\"Investing in poor people requires the involvement of every social strata. I believe that the returns from investing in poor people are just as great as [returns] from investing in the business world, and have even more meaning.\\" China had 358 billionaires at the end of 2013 – a rise of 41 over the previous year and the second-most of any country in the world, after the US. Yet in terms of charitable giving, it ranks among the world's worst. According to the World Giving Index 2013, an annual survey by the NGO Charities Aid Foundation (pdf) (pdf), China ranked 115 among 135 countries for donating money and last for volunteering. Income inequality counts among the country's most pressing social ills. According to a 2012 survey by Peking University, families in China's cities and coastal provinces earn significantly more than their rural and inland counterparts. An average Shanghai household, for example, brings in £2,790 a year, while an average family in the inland province Gansu makes less than £1,200. While handfuls of individuals have profited enormously from China's economic boom, few have shown willing to share their wealth. In 2010, Gates, who runs the 38bn Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the American business magnate Warren Buffet asked 50 of China's richest people to join a charity dinner in Beijing. Many turned down the invitation, reportedly because they were uncomfortable being asked for donations. Yet the country's philanthropic record is slowly improving. On Friday, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, co-founders of Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce company, announced plans to fund a 3bn foundation, the country's largest. The amount represents about 2% of the company's equity, all of it from the founders' shares. According to state media, the foundation will focus on environment, education and healthcare. Yet other details, such as its name and how the money will be distributed, remain unclear. Ma, China's eighth richest man, stepped down as Alibaba's CEO last year and has since dedicated much of his time to charity efforts. He sits on the Nature Conservancy's board of directors and helps lead kung fu star Jet Li's One Foundation. \\"When you register a new foundation in China you need a supervisory agency, so a lot of people have worried that by registering a private foundation they'd be giving up control over their personal wealth,\\" said Anthony Spires, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who researches China's civil society. \\"Many of these folks are used to being in charge – they have very clear issues that concern them … and they don't want the government to tell them how to spend their money.\\" Spires called the size of the promised foundation \\"staggering\\". \\"This will be the largest foundation in China, if they really do it,\\" he said. \\"It's on par with Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy.\\" Alibaba is preparing a high-profile initial public offering on the New York stock exchange. Analysts expect the company to be valued at more than 100bn, which would make its IPO one of the biggest in history. \\"My wife and I had this thought of setting up a personal charitable fund when we started the business,\\" Ma, 49, told the state newswire Xinhua. \\"We'd like to earn money before we turn 50 years old and do charitable work in our time after 50.\\" Gates has responded to Ma's announcement, saying that the foundation will \\"do an immense amount of good, particularly in this remarkable time in the development of philanthropy in China\\", the newswire reported. Warren Buffet has called the two Alibaba founders \\"extraordinary leaders in business [who] have now become leaders in philanthropy\\". What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article primarily focuses on the call made by Bill Gates for China's wealthiest individuals to increase their contributions to charity. Mr. Gates emphasized that the returns from investing in poor people can be just as rewarding as those from the business world. The context for this message is the significant economic disparity in China, where a rising number of billionaires coexists with poverty, especially in rural and inland areas. This socioeconomic imbalance makes philanthropic activity critical for sustainable development of the country.  Unfortunately, according to the World Giving Index 2013, China ranks poorly when it comes to charitable giving and volunteering, despite boasting the second largest number of billionaires in the world. The reluctance of these wealthy individuals to donate was notably demonstrated in 2010, when many declined an invitation from Gates and Warren Buffet to a charity dinner in Beijing due to unease about donation requests. However, the article reveals a possible positive change. Alibaba’s co-founders, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, announced the formation of a 3bn foundation, set to focus on environment, education, and healthcare – the largest in the country. This initiative was acknowledged by Gates and Buffet as a significant step in Chinese philanthropy. The way philanthropists in China operate is also discussed, as Prof. Anthony Spires notes that many wealthy individuals in China resist registering private foundations due to worries about surrendering control over their personal wealth to government agencies.  Overall, the news article highlights a pressing issue in China's socio-economic landscape in light of its increasing income disparity, and illustrates some of the active steps being taken by influential figures to encourage philanthropy and charitable donations among China's richest citizens."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the two commanding officers who were involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775? ?  Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.  Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...","output":"The full names of the two commanding officers involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 are Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"From the given information, it is not possible to directly determine if the first sentence's validity has any effect on the truth value of the second sentence. Each of these two sentences express different thoughts and should be analyzed independently, taking into consideration context, underlying assumptions, and possible implications of each. Sentence 1: \\"yeah yeah that's what i don't understand\\" This sentence suggests the speaker agrees with a previous statement or acknowledges the sentiment, but also highlights a lack of understanding about a certain aspect. To determine the truth of this statement, it is essential to be aware of the subject matter and context to which this sentence corresponds. Assessing the truth of this statement depends on whether the speaker genuinely does not understand a particular topic or point. Sentence 2: \\"I don't get why we're not paid better.\\" This sentence expresses the speaker's opinion on not being paid well enough, possibly indicating dissatisfaction with their current compensation. In this case, determining the truth value of the statement is more subjective, as it is based on the speaker's perception of their pay. Factors that could be considered to gauge the validity of this statement include salary comparisons within the same industry, company and region, and taking into account qualifications, experience, and job performance. In short, the first sentence's truth value does not influence the truth value of the second sentence directly, as they address distinct subjects—one is about a lack of understanding, while the other revolves around personal opinions on compensation.

A. can obliterate plastic toy   B. can obliterate house","output":"In comparing option A \\"can obliterate a plastic toy\\" and option B \\"can obliterate a house\\" with the goal to \\"bat\\", it's essential to understand the context in which the term \\"bat\\" is used. Often, \\"bat\\" refers to an implement with a handle and a solid surface, typically of wood, used for hitting the ball in games such as baseball, cricket, or table tennis. If \\"bat\\" means to strike or hit in the context of this goal, then option A \\"can obliterate a plastic toy\\" makes more sense to achieve this goal. In fact, a bat, particularly a baseball bat or cricket bat, could conceivably be used to strike and potentially break or \\"obliterate\\" a plastic toy. This type of action is physically feasible and in line with the typical use of a bat. On the other hand, option B \\"can obliterate a house” is a less realistic or practical method to utilize a bat. The term \\"obliterate\\" implies complete destruction or wiping out of existence. A house, made of materials like brick, concrete, or wood, would be highly resistant to destruction by a bat. It'd be nearly impossible to obliterate a house using a bat due to the significant difference in structure and strength between a bat and a house. The action not only deviates from normal use of a bat, but it also conjures images of excessive, unrealistic destruction. Therefore, when the goal is to \\"bat\\" and options A and B are evaluated, option A is far more attainable and reasonable.

Please answer this question: what super bowl did the eagles play in?","output":"The Philadelphia Eagles have played in three Super Bowl games throughout their history in the National Football League (NFL). 1. Super Bowl XV: The Eagles played in their first Super Bowl on January 25, 1981, against the Oakland Raiders at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Under the guidance of head coach Dick Vermeil, the Eagles faced a tough Raiders team led by head coach Tom Flores. The Raiders emerged victorious with a final score of 27-10. Philadelphia quarterback Ron Jaworski threw for 291 passing yards and one touchdown but couldn't overcome the strong Raiders defense that intercepted him three times during the game. 2. Super Bowl XXXIX: The Eagles' second Super Bowl appearance came on February 6, 2005, when they faced the New England Patriots at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Coached by Andy Reid, the Eagles were seen as the underdogs against the Patriots, led by head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. Despite a valiant effort by Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns, the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years with a final score of 24-21. McNabb's three interceptions and the Eagles' late-game clock mismanagement proved too costly for them to overcome. 3. Super Bowl LII: The Eagles played in their third Super Bowl on February 4, 2018, against the New England Patriots at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This time, the Eagles were led by head coach Doug Pederson and backup quarterback Nick Foles, who stepped in for the injured Carson Wentz. In a thrilling offensive battle, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl with a final score of 41-33. Foles, who threw for 373 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP. The game featured several memorable moments, including Foles' touchdown reception on a trick play called the \\"Philly Special,\\" and defensive end Brandon Graham's late-game strip-sack of Tom Brady, which helped seal the victory for Philadelphia.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  But I can use this background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.  What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? The answer is:","output":"It is difficult to definitively say which geologist, Barry or Will, learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge without knowing the specifics of their individual studies and experiences. However, based on their areas of specialization, some general assumptions can be made. Barry, as a geologist specializing in subduction zones and new seafloors, likely has deeper knowledge and understanding of processes occurring at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an active spreading center where new oceanic crust is created, which falls directly into Barry's area of expertise. He probably has studied the formation of new seafloor, the spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges (slow-spreading for the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), the geochemistry of basalts produced, and how these features contribute to the overall geology of the region. On the other hand, Will specializes in montology, which typically studies the formation and characteristics of mountains. While some aspects of montology might be relevant to the study of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, such as how the ridge's axial high might contribute to the geological features of the region, his focus is likely more on the formation and development of mountains rather than the specific processes occurring at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Considering their respective specializations, it would be reasonable to suggest that Will may have learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge compared to Barry. Barry's specialization in subduction zones and new seafloors directly relates to the geologic processes happening at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, whereas Will's focus on montology might offer a more limited overlap with the topic. However, it is essential to remember that the true extent of their knowledge would depend on their individual experiences, investigations, and studies throughout their careers as geologists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At least 25 years must have elapsed since a musician or group released its debut recording for the act to be eligible for induction. That makes Guns N’ Roses eligible for the first time because the L.A. hard rock outfit’s debut album, “Appetite for Destruction,” was released in 1987. Likewise, this is the first year of eligibility for rap duo Eric B. & Rakim, whose debut, “Paid in Full,” also appeared in 1987. King and Donovan are the senior members of this year’s nominees, having released their first recordings in 1961 and 1965, respectively. Because of the rancor over the years between Guns N' Roses founding member Axl Rose and former members of the band who have since departed, including guitarist Slash, the group's induction sets up the prospect of a dramatic reunion, if all parties opt to set aside their differences for the occasion. In a similar situation, Creedence Clearwater Revival singer, guitarist and songwriter John Fogerty refused to join with the Bay Area band's surviving members -- bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- when Creedence was inducted in 1993.

Every time she goes out, she takes extra care to accessorize her outfits with the perfect jewelry. Her friends always compliment her on her taste and style, making her feel confident and radiant. First, Jessie rummages through her dresser and carefully examines her extensive jewelry collection. She handpicked each piece for a specific reason or memory, so every time she wears each item, she feels attached to it. She ponders for a moment before her eyes land on her fabulous necklace. Next, she gently lifts the necklace from its compartment, taking a moment to admire the exquisite design and craftsmanship. It features an intricate chain with tiny yet dazzling gemstones that catch the light just right. As the centerpiece, a delicate pendant holds a stunning gemstone that reflects a myriad of colors with every movement. After that, she puts the necklace around her neck, adjusting the clasp in the back to make sure it's secure. The delicate chain perfectly frames her collarbone, drawing attention to her neck and face. She smiles, knowing that this jewelry can elevate her outfit to a whole new level of style and sophistication. Meanwhile, her ring – a simple, elegant band with a single gemstone – remains in her dresser. Although she appreciates its beauty and meaning, it doesn't hold the same allure as the necklace. The ring is a lot more reserved, failing to capture the attention and admiration of the people around her.

The beautiful piece of jewelry not only enhances her appearance but also imbues her with a sense of self-assurance that comes from knowing that she looks her absolute best. In conclusion, Jessie's preference for her fashionable necklace over her ring stems from the unique style it adds to her outfits, the compliments she receives, and the increased self-confidence she feels when wearing it.

I read Futureland earlier this year and when I saw that his latest novel, THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT, was not part of his mystery series I grabbed it from my local library. This novel is mesmerizing---I read it very nearly straight through. The main character Charles is despicable in many ways---lazy, selfish, corrupt, a thief, a womanizer---and yet Moseley makes us like him---mostly because Charles is very, very funny.Mr. Bennet, who Charles agrees to allow to stay in his basement in a makeshift prison cell in exchange for a pile of cash, on the other hand, is pure evil. Compared to Bennet, Charles is a saint, and as Charles gets to know just how evil Bennet is, it helps bring about his own redemption. The kinds of evil Bennet is involved in gives me chills even several weeks after reading the book. An excellent study in the real definition of evil and responsibility. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"The answer is: This review depicts the product in a flattering light. Step 1: Analyze the user's review, looking for positive and negative points. - Positive points: \\"excellent study,\\" \\"mesmerizing,\\" \\"riveting,\\" \\"disturbing,\\" \\"very, very funny\\" - Negative points: None Step 2: Weigh the positive and negative points - Positive points outweigh negative points, as there are no negative points mentioned in the review. Step 3: Consider the overall impression the review gives - The reviewer shares praise for the novel, mentions reading it very nearly straight through, and discusses the thought-provoking themes of evil and responsibility. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis - Since the positive points outweigh any negative points and the overall impression of the review is positive, it can be concluded that the review depicts the product in a flattering light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Daphniphyllum is the sole genus in the flowering plant family Daphniphyllaceae and was described as a genus in 1826. The genus includes evergreen shrubs and trees mainly native to east and southeast Asia, but also found in the Indian Subcontinent and New Guinea. Hypothesis: Daphniphyllum may someday be found in North America.","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis that Daphniphyllum may someday be found in North America, we need to consider several aspects, including its native habitat, adaptability, and potential routes of introduction to North America. While the future cannot be predicted with certainty, we can provide analysis based on the available information. Daphniphyllum, as mentioned, is native to eastern and southeastern Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and New Guinea. According to the information provided, it has not been discovered in North America to date. These plants are mainly found in regions with specific climates and conditions, such as warm, humid environments. Adaptability is a critical factor in determining if a species can someday be found in a new location. Some plants are highly adaptable and can grow in various conditions outside their native range, whereas others have specific needs that must be met to thrive. In the case of Daphniphyllum, the plant's preferred climate suggests it might be challenging to adapt to the wide-ranging climates of North America. Nonetheless, microclimates within North America might possess suitable conditions for its growth, such as the Pacific Northwest or southeastern United States, where warm and humid conditions prevail. A potential route for Daphniphyllum to be introduced to North America could be through human intervention. This might happen if the plant were brought intentionally for gardening purposes or by accident as a stowaway on imported goods. Governments and organizations often have measures in place to prevent the accidental introduction of non-native species, but it is still possible for a species to find its way to a new continent. Another possible route for Daphniphyllum to reach North America is through natural means, such as bird dispersal, ocean current movements, or through natural disasters. However, considering the significant geographical barriers and distance between the native regions of Daphniphyllum and North America, natural means of introduction are less likely. In conclusion, while it cannot be definitively confirmed or denied that Daphniphyllum may someday be found in North America, several factors need to be considered. Given the plant's native range, preferred climate, and the likelihood of introduction to North America through human intervention or natural means, it is possible, although not very probable, that Daphniphyllum might eventually find its way to North America. Suitable microclimates in North America might support its growth if it ever reaches the continent, but the likelihood remains relatively low based on the current understanding and information about this genus."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: \\"What was a primary issue?\\"  Context: \\"In October 2013, the New York Post reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for president. The former California governor would face a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V nominally prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, \\"The law is very clear, but it’s not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process.\\"\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"A primary issue in the context of Arnold Schwarzenegger potentially running for president in the United States is the constitutional hurdle posed by Article II, Section I, Clause V of the U.S. Constitution. This clause states that only natural-born citizens of the United States are eligible to assume the office of the President. Since Schwarzenegger was born in Austria and later became a naturalized U.S. citizen, he does not meet this requirement. In response to this challenge, it was reported that Schwarzenegger had been exploring ways to address the issue, such as lobbying legislators for a constitutional change or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's potential lawsuit could possibly win him the right to run for the office, but he also noted that it is not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce the law rather than leaving it to the political process.

He intends to take only Woody (Tom Hanks) with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the other toys in a bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother (Laurie Metcalf) mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy intended to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Barbie (Jodi Benson) bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake. Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour of the seemingly idyllic play-setting by a bear named Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (\\"Lotso\\") (Ned Beatty), a baby named Big Baby, and a doll named Ken (Michael Keaton), with whom Barbie falls in love. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie Anderson (Emily Hahn), one of the Sunnyside students. She takes Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play roughly with Andy's toys, unlike the gentler older children. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have them moved to the older children's room, but Lotso, who controls Sunnyside in a concentration camp-like style, refuses, explaining that the newer toys need to be sacrificed to the younger children to protect the older ones, who want to avoid enduring such damage and suffering. Seeing promise in Buzz, he resets him to his original space ranger persona, which also resets his memory. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris), through an eye she accidentally left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys and realizes Woody was telling the truth. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz.

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica.  and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40.

The room DID look exactly like the one in the picture.  Exactly, in fact.  King sized bed (pretty comfy), flat screen tv, REALLY cheap and ugly pink/black furry.....thing and all.  Didn't really appreciate the ghetto tagging etched into the window.  But that was small and easy to ignore.  And we really loved how centrally located the Flamingo is on the strip.  The Paris and Caesar's are a short walk away (well, \\"short\\" in Vegas terms).  We were enjoying our stay and the casino (did really well at Black Jack and the dealer - his name was T.G. - was alot of fun!!).  Had breakfast at the Paradise Buffet on Sunday morning.

When spaces are added, the sentence becomes:  \\"The eye is fooled into seeing 3 dimensional, physical objects even though, in reality, they are traditional flat road markings.\\" Now, breaking down the sentence to understand its context: 1. \\"The eye is fooled into seeing 3 dimensional, physical objects\\"- This statement suggests that our visual perception can sometimes be tricked into perceiving a flat, two-dimensional image as a three-dimensional object. This is a phenomenon referred to as optical illusion. In context of this sentence, it could relate to experiences where artwork, road markings or signs have been specifically designed to appear as 3D objects from a certain angle or perspective, creating an illusion. 2. \\"Even though, in reality, they are traditional flat road markings\\" - This part of the sentence reveals the actual truth behind these perceived 3D objects. Despite our eyes being tricked into perceiving depth and dimension, the objects they are viewing are, in fact, just traditional flat road marking. The contrast between what our eyes perceive and the reality is what creates this incredible illusion. Optical illusions have been studied extensively in psychology and vision science, as they underscore the complex processes behind how our eyes and brain perceive what we see.

People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists.  But I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development.

Write some highlights for the following article: Everton manager Roberto Martinez has followed the lead of his Merseyside rival Brendan Rodgers and told England manager Roy Hodgson to handle his star youngster Ross Barkley with care. Despite saying 20-year-old Barkley was ‘born to play football’ after his triumphant comeback against Aston Villa at Goodison Park on Saturday, Martinez is already laying down a marker ahead of next month when England face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and a hostile friendly in Scotland. Just as Rodgers has regularly warned against Raheem Sterling ‘burn-out’ and didn’t want him to play 180 minutes against San Marino and Estonia, Martinez is also advising caution with Barkley, who returned on Saturday for the first time since damaging knee ligaments in pre-season. Ross Barkley returned to the Everton starting line-up against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon. Everton manager Roberto Martinez (left) wants England boss Roy Hodgson (right) to take care over Barkley. The Spaniard knows that England coach Ray Lewington, who was at Goodison to watch, will have reported back to Hodgson with enthusiasm after Barkley played a part in Everton’s first two goals. ‘We need to be careful with Ross and Sterling,’ said Martinez. ‘Yes, England will want him in the next squad, but Ross still can’t play 90 minutes and we will have to see how long it takes for him to do that. ‘He’s been out for 14 weeks so we need to be careful. We have six games in three weeks (at Everton) so we need to give what the players needs. ‘With young players and England there needs to be a process to learn what is expected. Look at Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, they took it to a different level when they got the knowledge. ‘It is understandable that the young players go through those experiences before they can win games for England.’ The problem for Martinez is he can’t avoid talking up the midfielder himself, hailing him as a rare talent who can combine technical and physical excellence. Barkley left the game to a standing ovation from the Everton fans at Goodison Park. Raheem Sterling (right) returned to the Liverpool starting line-up on Sunday in their 3-2 win at QPR. It was Barkley’s stinging shot which forced the corner from which Jagielka scored Everton’s opener against Aston Villa after 18 minutes. Barkley then fed Romelu Lukaku for the second goal after 48 minutes, though Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan will feel he should have done better. Seamus Coleman wrapped up the points after 76 minutes after Barkley had already left the field to a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd. ‘It’s hard to explain how Ross could come back with a performance like that. It should have been impossible for him to start against Villa, but he trains so hard, he’s just a natural,’ said Martinez. ‘He just loves playing football, and you see that and in a way he had to play.’ Manchester City, who are short of top-class homegrown players, would be prepared to pay big money to take him to The Etihad so perhaps it wasn’t particularly wise for Martinez to add: ‘The bigger the game, the more you get from him.’ But the comparison with another Merseyside street footballer, Wayne Rooney, was apt. ‘There are similarities 100 per cent. Sometimes we have to drag Ross away from training because at the end he’s in the two v two with the young kids, and he loves it. Phil Jagielka is congratulated by Barkley and Leighton Baines (left) after scoring the opener against Villa. Belgium international Romelu Lukaku was also among the scorers in Everton's 3-0 win against Aston Villa. ‘We take him away because he doesn’t see the energy it takes out of his body. He approaches the game in that manner and that’s his biggest strength.’ Everton started the weekend just outside the bottom three without a win in five games. But their performance on Saturday suggests they will start climbing rapidly from now onwards although their next challenge is a Europa League trip to Lille on Thursday. Martinez will also have been pleased to see £28million record signing Lukaku notch his third goal of the season after an awkward start to the season for the giant Belgian. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is in the unusual position of hankering after Philippe Senderos after their capitulation at Goodison. Senderos, much-maligned during his career at Arsenal and Fulham, picked up a thigh injury on international duty with Switzerland and Villa flopped without him. ‘We missed Senderos because he has been excellent,’ admitted Lambert. ‘Hopefully he will be back for our next game against QPR. Skipper Ron Vlaar did return after a calf problem though the Villa boss thinks it will take a couple of weeks before he finds his top form again. Highlights:","output":"1. Everton manager Roberto Martinez praises Ross Barkley after comeback against Aston Villa but advises caution regarding international appearances. 2. Martinez compares Barkley's talent to that of Wayne Rooney and says young players need to be handled carefully to avoid burnout. 3. Barkley played a key role in Everton's first two goals against Aston Villa, contributing to their 3-0 win. 4.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London? ?  In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

On the second day of talks here, the ministers also said that holders of Greek bonds would have to take much bigger losses than the 21 percent originally agreed to in July, though one bank official said that despite the ministers’ consensus, no agreement was near on write-offs that could reach as high as 60 percent. The ministers also reported that France and Germany had made progress on a third issue, how to increase the firepower of a rescue fund for the euro zone. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, along with other European leaders, continued negotiating later Saturday. “I believe that now we have reached a more realistic view of the situation in Greece and that we will provide the necessary means to be able to protect the euro,” Mrs. Merkel said as she arrived at a gathering of European center-right leaders outside Brussels. The Sunday meeting would not bring final decisions, she said, adding that the leaders would take definitive steps at another scheduled meeting on Wednesday. Despite resistance from Spain and Italy, agreement seemed close on a plan worth around 100 billion euros, or 138 billion, to recapitalize European banks. The measure is intended to help banks better withstand turmoil in the markets. “We have laid down foundations for an agreement on the banking side,” said Anders Borg, Sweden’s finance minister. The talks on Saturday established an improved tone over the past week, when differences between Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy burst into the open. But the challenge remains for leaders to construct a comprehensive and credible package of measures by Wednesday’s meeting. Ministers were on track to ask bankers to write off around half of the value of their Greek bond holdings after a report by international lenders suggested that the economy in Greece had deteriorated so significantly that the 60 percent haircut was needed. “We have agreed yesterday that we have to have a significant increase in the banks’ contribution,” Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who is the head of the euro group of finance ministers, said on Saturday. He did not offer a specific figure. But Charles Dallara, the managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which has been negotiating on behalf of the banks, said the two sides were “nowhere near a deal,” The Associated Press reported. One remaining worry is that Greece shows few signs of returning to economic growth and, though he declined to say how much in losses banks would be willing to accept, Mr. Dallara added, “We would be open to an approach that involves additional efforts from everyone.” Greece’s deteriorating economic outlook was the subject of intense discussions among the ministers with Germany and the Netherlands pressing their case that private investors needed to take bigger losses. According to the international lenders’ report, a 60 percent loss for bondholders would be needed to bring Greece’s debt below 110 percent of gross domestic product by 2020. That represents a huge increase from the 21 percent losses private investors agreed to accept only three months ago. Without action, Greece’s financing needs could amount to roughly 252 billion euros through 2020, the document said, while under a worse outlook, the needs, including rollover of existing debt, could approach 450 billion euros. The emerging comprehensive package is highly complex and involves painstaking negotiations around issues that are often linked. For example, the deal to strengthen European banks is seen as vital to protect the banks from the fallout from write-downs on Greek bonds. The ministers agreed on Friday to release the majority of loans worth 8 billion euros to prevent Greece from defaulting. The International Monetary Fund could contribute about 2 billion euros to that fund. The biggest area of difference between France and Germany seemed to be narrowing after France appeared to be giving ground on how to bolster the euro rescue fund. Mrs. Merkel had firmly opposed the French suggestion that the fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, should get a banking license, which would enable it to borrow from the European Central Bank. France’s finance minister, François Baroin, said on Friday that the issue was “not a definitive point of discussion for us,” adding that “what matters is what works.” On Saturday, the Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, said that use of the central bank was “no longer an option” but that two options were under consideration. Both options involve plans to insure against a portion of losses on Italian or Spanish bonds. Under one version this insurance would be offered by the bailout fund. The other would form an agency to buy bonds, perhaps attracting new investors like sovereign wealth funds. This would buy bonds on the primary and secondary markets using insurance offered by the bailout fund, said one official briefed on discussions but not authorized to speak publicly. One advantage of this plan might be that it could force clearer conditions for reform on countries whose bonds are bought.

I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

Cream, in songs like \\"I Feel Free\\" (1966) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton. Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll.

The Court of Appeal ruled the officers can sue the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. They accused the Met of \\"letting them down badly\\" by not defending them against claims they beat Mr Ahmad. In March 2009 the Met paid Â£60,000 to Mr Ahmad after admitting he had been subjected to an attack. The Met initially denied Mr Ahmad's claim that he was punched, kicked and throttled during his December 2003 arrest. However, lawyers for the then commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson admitted at the High Court that Mr Ahmad had been the victim of \\"gratuitous and sustained violence\\" at his home in Tooting, south-west London. In 2011 the four officers - PCs Rod James-Bowen, Nigel Cowley, Mark Jones and Det Con John Donohue - were charged over the assault, but were later acquitted. Who is Babar Ahmad? Babar Ahmad was jailed in the US after setting up a website considered to be a key moment in the birth of the internet jihad. He was sentenced to 12-and-a-half years but fought an eight-year-long campaign against extradition. Mr Ahmad was released from a US prison in June last year and returned home after the authorities took into account his lengthy custody in the UK. The officers' initial claim for damages was rejected by the High Court. On appeal, judges ruled the four were entitled to bring their claim \\"for economic and reputational harm based on a breach of a duty of care at common law\\". The appeal judges said the officers were claiming the commissioner breached a duty of care when he admitted liability over Ahmad and made a public apology.

If you're on one of these medications, it could be the cause of your high prolactin levels.  Dopamine, a brain chemical, blocks some secretion of prolactin. When you're on medications that block or lower your dopamine levels, your prolactin levels may rise. Some antipsychotics can cause this effect, such as risperidone, molindone, trifluoperazine, and haloperidol, and some antidepressants can, too. Metoclopramide, which is prescribed for severe nausea and acid reflux, may also increase the secretion of prolactin. A few medications that treat high blood pressure could also be the culprit, though it happens less frequently with these medications, which include reserpine, verapamil, and alpha-methyldopa. You don't want to go off a medication abruptly, especially one like an antipsychotic, which can have severe withdrawal effects. Therefore, if you want to get off one of these medications, discuss the issue with your doctor first. They may be able to switch you to another medication that doesn't have this effect. This medication has been shown to reduce prolactin levels when taken in place of other antipsychotics or when taken in addition to other antipsychotics. Ask your doctor if taking this medication is a possibility for you.  Antipsychotics have the potential to raise prolactin since it inhibits the dopamine that causes prolactin to secrete from the pituitary gland. For long-term antipsychotic treatment, you may develop a tolerance so your prolactin levels return to normal, but they may stay above normal levels.  This medication can cause side effects like dizziness, nervousness, headaches, stomach issues, weight gain, and pain in your joints. It can also make you feel unsteady on your feet.","output":"This article discusses how certain prescription medications, including some antipsychotics, antidepressants, and medications for severe nausea, acid reflux, and high blood pressure, may lead to increased prolactin levels due to their effects on dopamine, and advises speaking with a doctor about alternative medication options and potential side effects before making any changes to one's treatment plan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to March 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a \\"greater confusion of purpose\\", yet led to a war noted for its \\"notoriously incompetent international butchery.\\"  - The Eastern Orthodox Church, also known as the Orthodox Church, or officially as the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second largest Christian church and one of the oldest current religious institutions in the world. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission to the apostles. It practices what it understands to be the original Christian faith and maintains the sacred tradition passed down from the apostles.  - Nicholas I (  I  , r Nikolai I Pavlovich ; 6 July ( O.S. 25 June ) 1796 -- 2 March ( O.S. 18 February ) 1855 ) was the Emperor of Russia from 1825 until 1855 . He was also the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland . He is best known as a political conservative whose reign was marked by geographical expansion , repression of dissent , economic stagnation , poor administrative policies , a corrupt bureaucracy , and frequent wars that culminated in Russia 's disastrous defeat in the Crimean War of 1853 - 56 . His biographer Nicholas V. Riasanovsky says that Nicholas displayed determination , singleness of purpose , and an iron will , along with a powerful sense of duty and a dedication to very hard work . He saw himself as a soldier -- a junior officer totally consumed by spit and polish . A handsome man , he was highly nervous and aggressive . Trained as an engineer , he was a stickler for minute detail . His reign had an ideology called \`\` Official Nationality '' that was proclaimed officially in 1833 . It was a reactionary policy based on orthodoxy in religion , autocracy in government , and Russian nationalism . He was the younger brother of his predecessor , Alexander I. Nicholas inherited his brother 's throne despite the failed Decembrist revolt against him and went on to become the most reactionary of all Russian leaders . His aggressive foreign policy involved many expensive wars , having a disastrous effect on the empire 's finances . He was successful against Russia 's neighbouring southern rivals as he seized the last territories in the Caucasus held by Persia ( comprising modern day Armenia and Azerbaijan ) by successfully ending the Russo - Persian War ( 1826 -- 28 ) . By now , Russia had gained what is now Dagestan , Georgia , Azerbaijan and Armenia from Persia , and had therefore at last gained the clear upper hand in the Caucasus , both geo - politically as well as territorially .

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are McKinney and May continuing alone to complete?  The film, narrated primarily by McKinney herself and supplemented by other interviews with primary characters and experts, is presented by animated headlines, newspaper photos, and brief televised news reports from the time of the case. McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \\"clean-cut, all-American boy\\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his  religious mission. McKinney states that she and Anderson fell madly in love and that they were engaged to be married, but that she mistrusted the Mormon church and its hold over Anderson, declaring the church to be a \\"cult\\" that had \\"brainwashed\\" him. Former Mormon turned activist Troy Williams offers insight into Mormon practices, beliefs, and attitudes to explain how Mormonism might seem cult-like to one not raised in the religion. When Anderson was sent to England on his mission, McKinney, believing that the church elders deliberately separated them, recruited a pilot (Jackson Shaw, who appears in interviews) to fly her, her friend Keith \\"K.J.\\" May, and a hired bodyguard named Gil Parker to England on a \\"rescue mission\\" McKinney framed in terms of a romantic caper. Upon arriving in England, McKinney allegedly revealed items such as handcuffs, chloroform, and a fake handgun, causing Shaw and Parker to fear they might be participating in something illegal.

In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  But I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  What is an answer for this question: Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","output":"Test C saw higher concentrations of the products. This is because the forward reaction was favored in test C, leading to an increase in the concentration of the products and a decrease in the concentration of the reactants. In contrast, test D favored the reverse reaction, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of the products and an increase in the concentration of the reactants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: 9Â½ Weeks Movie plot: The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman. John asks her if she went through his stuff, declaring that he will punish her. Their ensuing altercation escalates into sexual assault until she blissfully concedes to his struggle to overpower her. Their sexual intensity grows as they start having sex in public places.

Context: Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of LSU, theorize that Madison's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\"—was rejected by the House, in favor of the more general \\"religion\\" in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists. To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown.

Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.

Question: Who does Sowell consider to be the main losers in affirmative action? Context: Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147 The answer is:","output":"Thomas Sowell considers the main losers in affirmative action to be the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups, such as poor white or Asian individuals. He argues that affirmative action policies tend to primarily benefit the most fortunate among the preferred group, like upper and middle-class blacks, often to the detriment of those who are less fortunate in the non-preferred groups.

Process:  - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You go on a juice/water cleanse more often happens, how will it affect Your liver will be impacted by more toxins.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that going on a juice/water cleanse more often may introduce more toxins to the liver. To understand if this will have a direct or indirect effect on the blood processing in the liver, we need to consider whether the juice/water cleanse contains more harmful substances or fewer nutrients the liver needs to function properly. Step 2: Determine if the juice/water cleanse contains more toxins or fewer nutrients than the liver needs The contents of a juice/water cleanse can vary greatly depending on the ingredients used. Generally, juice cleanses provide a high amount of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants from fruits and vegetables. Water cleanses help increase hydration and potentially enhance detoxification processes. However, if the juice/water cleanse lacks balanced nutrients, such as protein and healthy fats, the liver might struggle to efficiently process the blood and produce energy. Furthermore, the presence of pesticides or other harmful substances in non-organic produce used in the cleanse might introduce more toxins for the liver to process. Step 3: Assess the effect of the supposed perturbation on the liver's blood processing process It is essential to establish whether the perturbation (going on a juice/water cleanse more often) will impact the liver's ability to process blood. If the liver receives more toxins or inadequate nutrients due to the juice/water cleanse, there could be several possible implications: 1. Direct impact: The liver's ability to clean the blood may be reduced or impaired due to the increased presence of toxins or lack of essential nutrients. This could result in the liver being less effective at purifying the blood. 2. Indirect impact: The lack of balanced nutrients may affect other organs or body systems, which can lead to additional stress being placed on the liver. For example, inadequate nutrient intake may weaken the immune system, causing the body to be more susceptible to infections. Consequently, the liver may need to work harder to filter out toxins and waste products from the blood. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of going on a juice/water cleanse more often could have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's blood processing process. The exact impact will depend on the specific juice/water cleanse and individual variations in users' physiology, but potentially, more toxins and inadequate nutrient intake could compromise the liver's ability to efficiently clean the blood and produce energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But after all, the series is not called \\"Die Dr3i\\" for nothing, so it is logically purely plot-wise that of course our three friends (initially only Jupe) have their doubts before they go about exposing this trivial charade... There is nothing more to say from my side, only that the disappointment about the series outweighs the enthusiasm. Europa actually continues where it left off with episode 120: trickling stories without tension and everything always following the same worn-out pattern. If that's enough for anyone: please, but that's not enough for me! If I buy a BAD audio play in the future, then definitely not from Europa...\\" Sentiment Analysis: The review expresses disappointment and skepticism about the plot of the series and is critical of the lack of tension and originality. The review also mentions that the disappointment outweighs the enthusiasm. Classification: Since the overall sentiment of the review is negative, we classify it as \\"NEG\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph: Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.  Question: \\"What are the consequences of LAD funding cuts and who will be affected most?\\" Answer: \\"Will provide fewer servies & staff will be most affected\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not entirely correct. While it is true that there will be fewer services provided, the statement \\"staff will be most affected\\" does not capture the whole picture. The consequences of Legal Aid and Defender (LAD) funding cuts are expected to have a significant impact on the poor population in Michigan, particularly those who require legal aid services. Several thousands of Michigan's poor who are in need of legal services may not receive it, or they may receive significantly limited assistance. The provided answer fails to mention the specific services that may be reduced or limited, which include civil legal matters such as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. Additionally, the answer does not mention that the most affected population will be the poor, especially those living in Wayne County, where the largest concentration of poverty in the state resides. LAD is set to lose over 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, making up almost half of the state's total loss in funding. These funding cuts may result in the poor being \\"victimized twice - once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" Local providers will need to adapt by working harder and smarter, using more technology to replace staff and provide as much service as possible with fewer funds. They also plan on providing more self-help training for clients to enable them to navigate the legal system on their own for routine matters, increasing telephone assistance, and offering less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Giant pandas are now extremely rare. Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory       Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild.

(CNN) -- When my airplane touched down in Birmingham, Alabama, I could not stop grinning. The trip last weekend fulfilled a lifelong dream to visit all 50 states. At age 31, I reached my goal. Alabama may not be at the top of many travel wish lists -- it wasn't on mine -- but its layered history offers many memorable experiences. I took an airport selfie right away, holding a map of the USA on which I proudly wrote, \\"I've been to ALL 50 states!\\" It's a map my dad pulled out of a phone book when I was a kid, penciling in the year we checked off each state. I've carried that simple map along on my travels, slowly filling it in. History is filled with a mixture of tragedy and triumph, and","output":"Alabama is no exception. Stepping off the plane, I was eager to immerse myself in this unique Southern state's narrative. My first stop was Birmingham's Civil Rights District, where I visited important landmarks such as the 16th Street Baptist Church, the site of a racially motivated bombing that killed four young girls in 1963. This tragic event became a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement and helped bring national attention to the struggle for racial equality in the United States. Moving on from Birmingham, I headed south to Montgomery, the state's capital, which has played a significant role in the civil rights history. Here, I stood at the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where demonstrators were brutally attacked during the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. I was in awe of the courage and determination that defined these pivotal moments in American history. While exploring Alabama, I also discovered its rich cultural tapestry. From the vibrant live music scene in Muscle Shoals to the inspiring artwork at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, I was pleasantly surprised at every turn. Alabama's beautiful landscapes left me breathless, with the scenic vistas of the Appalachian Mountains in the north and the pristine white-sand beaches of the Gulf Coast in the south. In between my historical journey and cultural exploration, I indulged in the state's delicious local cuisine – from mouthwatering barbecue to decadent pecan pies. With each meal, I chatted with friendly locals who were happy to share their love for their home state. As my trip came to an end, I realized that Alabama, much like every other state, has its own unique charm and history that deserve to be appreciated. While it may not have initially been on my travel wish list, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have experienced such a multifaceted destination. The map that my dad pulled out of a phone book all those years ago was now complete, and I felt a deep sense of accomplishment and connection to each corner of our diverse nation. In conclusion, my journey to Alabama enlightened me on the significance of this state's layered history, deep-rooted culture, and remarkable beauty, solidifying that every state has something special to offer. My travels have taught me to approach each destination with an open mind and heart, embracing the unexpected joys that come with exploring new places."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: a. no b. yes","output":"b. yes Both sentences convey the same meaning, even though the structure and word choice differ slightly. In the first sentence, \\"In the United Kingdom, mescaline in dried powder form is a Class A drug. However, purified cactus can be bought and sold legally,\\" it provides the legal status of mescaline in dried powder form as a Class A drug and contrasts this with the legal status of a purified cactus by using the word \\"However.\\" In the second sentence, \\"In the United Kingdom, mescaline is a class A drug in dried powder form, but cleaned cactus can be bought and sold legally,\\" the legal classification of mescaline in dried powder form is still shared, followed by a different conjunction, \\"but,\\" and the statement about clean cactus being available for legal buying and selling. Both sentences have the same primary focus, which is the distinction between the legal status of dried powder mescaline as a Class A drug and the legality of purchasing and selling purified or cleaned cacti. The difference in word choice, such as \\"purified\\" versus \\"cleaned,\\" does not change the core meaning. Additionally, the use of \\"However\\" and \\"but\\" serves the same purpose of contrasting the two points being made. Therefore, the two sentences share the same meaning."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. Question: Who held his body stiff as he faced the CAthar Fortress? Options:  A. Dominican friar  B. Roland  C. not enough information  D.

The Wagner tuba, as mentioned, is a modified member of the horn family. It is a brass instrument that has a unique sound somewhere between that of a trombone and the more traditional French horn. Richard Wagner specifically designed this instrument for his Ring cycle, and it has since been adopted by several composers, including Richard Strauss, for use in their own compositions. In Richard Strauss's works, the Wagner tuba can be heard in pieces such as his operas \\"Elektra\\" and \\"Die Frau ohne Schatten,\\" as well as in his \\"Alpine Symphony.\\" Furthermore, the Wagner tuba also appears in Béla Bartók's Eötvös Csongor et Tünde and has a significant role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major.  So, returning to your question, the name of the modified member of the horn family that appears in several works by Strauss is the Wagner tuba.

The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... What is probably true about the outcome of the summit? - The Korean War will persist for another 70 years. - It will formally bring an end to a state of war on the Korean peninsula. - not enough information - If the summit goes poorly, U.S.-North Korean relations will decline. Answer:","output":"Not enough information can be provided to predict the exact outcome of the summit. While the summit aimed to narrow the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over denuclearization, its results would depend on the negotiations and agreements between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. The summit could potentially pave the way for a peace treaty and formally end the state of war on the Korean peninsula, however, without more information, it's not possible to predict with certainty. If the summit were to go poorly, it could lead to a decline in U.S.-North Korean relationships, but the specific outcome would still be uncertain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to recent developments, it appears that Curtis may have been framed by a former friend, leading to the charges against him being dropped. At a press conference held today, Curtis was adamant in his defense, stating that he had never even heard of the dangerous toxin. \\"I've never heard of ricin or whatever. I thought they said rice. I told them I don't eat rice,\\" an incredulous Curtis told reporters. Curtis' defense lawyer, Christi McCoy, emphasized the seemingly orchestrated nature of the situation, saying that the real culprit had succeeded in implicating her client by incorporating Curtis' catchphrase, \\"I'm KC and I approve this message,\\" into the threatening notes sent to Washington. A few other clues pointing to Curtis were also included in the messages, leaving no doubt in McCoy's mind that her client had been framed. As the investigation continues, authorities have found new leads pointing to another individual who may be responsible for sending the ricin-laced letters. This person, who has not yet been named, is believed to be a former friend of Curtis and allegedly had a motive for framing him. The FBI has reportedly conducted searches at the new suspect's residence and is in the process of collecting evidence that could lead to charges being filed against this individual. The case of Kevin Curtis serves as a stark reminder of the potential for those accused of criminal activity to be innocent, despite what might initially appear as compelling evidence against them. The unfolding story has captured national attention and rattled the nation's capital, rekindling memories of dangerous deliveries in the past, such as the anthrax-laced letters following the September 11th attacks. As this case continues to develop and the FBI works toward apprehending the true perpetrator of this crime, vigilant citizens are once more reminded of the ever-present need for security and caution. With charges now dropped against Curtis, the focus turns toward vindication and getting to the bottom of this frightening ordeal. This news story serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement and the public alike, that jumping to conclusions based on initial evidence may not always lead to the correct suspect, and that a thorough and fair investigation must always be given priority in the pursuit of justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

UPDATED:. 08:58 EST, 27 December 2013. Angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the Boxing Day sales. High street stores enjoyed record takings, with more than £3billion in total thought to have gone through the tills and footfall up on last year. But within hours, consumers vented their anger on Twitter after discovering some items were originally cheaper before the Boxing Day sales began. Angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the Boxing Day sales. Consumer groups warned shoppers to be on their guard against such ‘pseudo-sales’, in which prices are inflated just before they are discounted so that the deal looks better than it actually is. Yesterday there were concerns shoppers may have fallen victim to such tactics after furious messages appeared on Twitter from shoppers who claimed they had been ripped off. Chelsea Corcoran wrote: ‘The shoes I wanted are more expensive in the sale than they were originally, what??’ Eleanor Hampton wrote: ‘Confused how some trainers are now more expensive in the sale than before Xmas’. Helena Emmanuel added: ‘Went on the  @ZARA website and a cardigan I saw two days ago in the shop is now more expensive on the sales page. B***** scam.’ High Street stores had record sales this Boxing Day though some shoppers feel they could have been duped into thinking items were cheaper than they ever had been. Meanwhile, Keith from Belfast took a photograph of an apparently dubious ‘sale’ item in the outdoor clothing store Trespass. A huge red sale label claimed the. men’s trousers were reduced from £76.99 to £38.49, while the original. tag showed the usual price was apparently just £34.99. He wrote: ‘Either @trespass don’t know how a sale works, or they’re trying to cheat people. Check the different prices.’ Meanwhile. City worker Colin Jäger, from Hampshire, wrote: ‘@Homebase_uk I’m not. impressed how you increased the prices of what I wanted to buy by 28%. just before your 20% sale.’ ‘It now costs more!!! ‘Disgraceful practice of putting up prices just before announcing your 20% sale – what a con!!’. A spokeswoman for Homebase said: 'Homebase has genuine offers and we fully adhere to the law surrounding pricing and promotion, taking into account pricing guidance. In doing this we work closely with Trading Standards. 'We update our pricing frequently to ensure that we offer customers the best deals in what is a highly complex and competitive trading environment.' Consumer group Which? has urged shoppers. to be vigilant of such tactics and warned them to ‘know their shopping. rights for the Boxing Day sales’. Thousands queued to be first through the doors at Selfridges in London on Boxing Day. Under Trading Standards rules, pre-sale prices should be the last price at which goods were offered –and the goods should have been at that price for 28 consecutive days in the previous six months. Which? has previously attacked supermarkets for pulling a similar stunt. Some stores were found to inflate prices for just a few days, before promoting their products as being half-price or better for weeks afterwards. The consumer group said chains were exploiting loopholes in fair-trading legislation to advertise offers on items such as fruit and wine ‘that might mislead you into thinking you are getting an extra-special bargain when you are not’. Yesterday Guy Anker, managing editor. of MoneySavingExpert.com urged customers to be careful when shopping in. the Boxing Day sales to ensure the discounts advertised were genuine. He. said: ‘We know that prices are being manipulated in some stores, which. is disingenuous. Shops put the price up a few days before they put the. goods in the sale, which dilutes the true value of the sale. It is easy. to get seduced by labels offering 50 per cent off or three for two. What. is more important is whether it is good value. Though record sales were taken, this year marked the first year there were more online shoppers than those on the High Street. ‘Just because it is in the sale it does not automatically mean you are getting the best price.’ Yesterday, retailers were celebrating bumper sales. Selfridges said online sales figures for Christmas Day were double last year’s, but in a sign that shoppers have not yet deserted the high street, 120,000 people visited its Oxford Street store yesterday. Manchester’s Trafford Centre said it believed it was the biggest Boxing Day sale in its history,  while in London, 1.4million shoppers spent an estimated £50 million in the West End. Elsewhere, fights reportedly broke out between shoppers keen to snap up the best deals. Twitter user Kopsend wrote: ‘Punch-up in Next in Ipswich. People are going mad’, while  Peter Foulkes said: ‘Next sale is manic – a woman started a fight with a guy over a £6 T-shirt’. Georgia Welsh wrote: ‘Fight in River Island sale because someone pushed in.’ Overwhelmed shoppers took to Twitter to describe fights breaking out in stores like River Island and Next. Many shoppers admitted snapping up the discounted designer goods so they could sell them online. Student Richie Ling, 21, who emerged from Harvey Nichols, in Leeds, said: ‘I have spent over £2,000 so far today. ‘I’ve bought three Gucci handbags and four Gucci wallets. Some of them will be gifts for my family, the rest I’ll be putting straight on eBay. ‘I got almost 50 per cent off some of the items so it could potentially be a good earner – the presents might even pay for themselves.’ None of the shops mentioned in the complaints were available for comment last night.

Eight-month-old Percy, who was found by policemen out on patrol, was left malnourished and suffering from an infectious skin condition on New Year's Day. The piglet was taken in by stunned RSPCA staff who discovered that he refused to eat normal pig food and was malnourished after being fed sandwiches by his former owners. Eight-month-old Percy is now living in an RSPCA centre in Leicester. The staff there are attempting to nurse him back to health street before, it is unbelievably cruel, especially on","output":"a day meant to bring in new beginnings and celebrations like New Year's Day. Abandoning any animal is heartless, but to leave a piglet like Percy, malnourished and suffering from an infectious skin condition, shows a complete lack of empathy and understanding on the part of his former owners. Pigs are intelligent, social animals, and such treatment would have caused untold emotional distress in addition to the physical suffering Percy had been subjected to. Moreover, feeding Percy sandwiches instead of proper pig food shows the previous owners' negligence towards providing proper nourishment and care. When RSPCA staff took Percy in, they were shocked to find that he refused to eat normal pig food, indicating that his previous diet had affected his eating habits, most likely causing further health problems. The result of such inadequate care was a weakened, and sick piglet who is now being given the love, attention, and care he so desperately needed. RSPCA staff in Leicester are now working tirelessly to help nurse Percy back to health. Under their care, Percy is slowly being introduced to proper pig food with a balanced diet to help him regain his strength and improve his overall well-being. In addition to addressing his malnourishment, the dedicated staff is also treating Percy's infectious skin condition with appropriate medication and care, ensuring that he has a smooth and painless recovery. During his time at the RSPCA centre, Percy has displayed an incredible resilience and eagerness to heal. With the support of his caretakers, the once abandoned piglet is slowly finding his way towards a happy and healthy life. He has shown a great capacity to trust and bond with the staff, despite the mistreatment he experienced at the hands of his former owners. It is sobering to think that Percy's ordeal could have been avoided if his original owners had considered the responsibility of raising a pig before deciding to keep him as a pet. Ensuring that you have the appropriate knowledge, resources, and dedication to care for an animal is vital for the well-being of both the owner and the pet. Percy's story serves as a stark reminder of the sad reality that many animals face each day—abandonment and mistreatment at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them. Despite the hardships Percy has faced, his tale is one of hope and resilience, as the RSPCA staff in Leicester demonstrate a true commitment to giving Percy the chance to live a long, healthy, and happy life. Once Percy has fully recovered, the RSPCA centre will make it their mission to find him a new, loving home where he can continue to thrive and grow. The hope is that Percy's story will also serve as a lesson to others about the importance of treating animals with empathy, respect, and compassion. Furthermore, this tale underscores the essential role that organizations like the RSPCA play in supporting animals in distress and providing them with the care and love they deserve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the version you might be referring to – which is famously known as \\"The Band\\" version – was not originally sung by Dylan himself. The song first gained prominence when it was recorded by The Band, a Canadian-American group that was initially named Levon and the Hawks. The Band's version of \\"I Shall Be Released\\" was featured on their debut album, \\"Music from Big Pink,\\" released in 1968. The Band was comprised of talented musicians, including Levon Helm, the only American member, along with Canadian members Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson. All five contributed vocals throughout their career, creating a unique polyphonic vocal sound that was integral to the group's identity. On the track \\"I Shall Be Released,\\" Richard Manuel was the primary vocalist, with the other members providing background vocals and harmonies. Manuel's distinct, soulful voice brought its emotional quality to the song, helping it become one of The Band's most memorable and enduring recordings. Bob Dylan, who wrote the song, eventually recorded it himself and also included it on his 1971 album \\"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II.\\" Since its initial release, \\"I Shall Be Released\\" has been covered by numerous artists across different genres, such as Joe Cocker, Nina Simone, The Heptones, and The Jerry Garcia Band, to name a few.

As stated, the primary setting of the \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" world of \\"Forgotten Realms\\" is extensively detailed in the \\"Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting\\" (2001) from Wizards of the Coast. Additionally, various locales and aspects are described more in-depth in separate campaign setting books. This implies that the world of Faerûn has a rich and detailed landscape, which would typically consist of various geographical features like mountains, forests, plains, and more. Furthermore, Faerûn has been used as a setting in around a hundred novels and several computer and video games. Given that mountains are a common and important aspect of many fantasy worlds when designing environments and landscapes, it is reasonable to assume that Faerûn, as a fully developed and expansive setting, would include mountains as part of its geographical makeup. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"Faerûn has mountains on it\\" is not explicitly confirmed in the given text, it is reasonable to deduce that Faerûn would likely have mountains as part of its diverse and intricate geography, consistent with it being a detailed and immersive fictional subcontinent in the \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" world of \\"Forgotten Realms\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both fishing communities there are still prosperous, but the southern one had a couple of bad years, with fish and other marine wildlife becoming more scarce. The southern beach had erosion problems as well. The northern beach recovered, and is suitable for tourism.  Which region has a less coral riffs? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that the south region has less coral reefs.  Step 1: Assess the impact of sand mining - Sand mining can lead to coastal erosion and potentially damage marine habitats, including coral reefs. Step 2: Compare the environmental conditions of both regions - The northern coastal region stopped sand mining 20 years ago. As a result, the area has recovered and is now suitable for tourism. This indicates that the marine environment is relatively healthy, including coral reefs. - The southern region continues to practice sand mining. This area has experienced issues like fish scarcity, erosion problems, and other negative impacts on marine life, suggesting that the coastal ecosystem is being damaged over time. Step 3: Determine the region with fewer coral reefs - Based on the environmental conditions of both regions, the southern region is more likely to have less coral reefs due to the ongoing sand mining activities and the observed negative impacts on its marine ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the album whose sales generate royalties used to benefit the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme? from the following article ?  Bob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \\"Life Is Hard,\\" \\"the record sort of took its own direction\\". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work. Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that the record \\"features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year.\\"In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart. It also reached number one on the UK album chart, 39 years after Dylan's previous UK album chart topper New Morning. This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart.On October 13, 2009, Dylan released a Christmas album, Christmas in the Heart, comprising such Christmas standards as \\"Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\". Dylan's royalties from the sale of this album will benefit the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme.The album received generally favorable reviews. The New Yorker commented that Dylan had welded a pre-rock musical sound to \\"some of his croakiest vocals in a while\\", and speculated that Dylan's intentions might be ironic: \\"Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity; to claim there's not a wink...

She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity.[4][5] As Alia negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have what seems to be yet another abortion.[4] [1] Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.[1] My question: What is Khedija's occupation?

Process: - Air is brought in through the mouth - Passes through the lungs - And into the bronchial tissue - The carbon dioxide is removed - The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body.  Question: suppose the person is dead happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"In the event of a person's death, there would be a significant impact on the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream, ultimately leading to less oxygen being delivered. To understand this, it is essential to analyze each step of the process, and how a person's death would influence these steps. 1. Air is brought in through the mouth: When a person is alive, the involuntary action of breathing allows air to enter the mouth and move to the lungs. In a deceased person, there is no muscular function; therefore, inhalation ceases, and no new air is brought into the body. 2. Air passes through the lungs: As mentioned above, without the muscle function to bring air into the lungs, no oxygen can be delivered to the lungs for exchange in a dead person. 3. Air passes into the bronchial tissue: In a functioning respiratory system, the air travels to the bronchial tissue, where the exchange of gases occurs. However, this relies on a living individual's ability to breathe. Without this critical function, air would not pass into the bronchial tissue in a deceased person. 4. Carbon dioxide is removed: In a living person's respiratory process, oxygen attaches to the hemoglobin in the blood and is carried to cells throughout the body, while carbon dioxide is removed and expelled. With the discontinuation of muscular function in a dead person, there is no exchange of gases in the lungs. Consequently, carbon dioxide is not removed, and the body's pH balance may become toxic as a result. 5. Oxygen is brought to the rest of the body: In an individual who is still alive, the heart continuously pumps blood throughout the body, thereby transporting oxygen and other essential nutrients to every cell. Once a person dies, their heart stops, and blood circulation ceases, preventing vital oxygen distribution. This inevitably leads to cellular damage and decay. To summarize, the death of a person has a tremendous impact on the delivery of oxygen to their bloodstream. Given the cessation of all bodily functions, including breathing, gas exchange, and circulation, the overall result would be significantly less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Charlie Hebdo: As ‘PEN Award 6′ withdraw, post-attack legacy is still being drawn THE LEGACY of the slain Charlie Hebdo cartoonists continues to find form and definition by the day. And it is ever looking as though their pen line will remain a longstanding dividing line: Should their collective cartoons aimed at Islam — sometimes by depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad — stand as a symbol of free speech, paid for in the highest price of human lives? Or are they a sign of irresponsibly hateful satire wielded with disproportionate venom, ultimately not in the name of a free press, but rather in the vein of pure and reckless provocation? This month, in the wake of Garry Trudeau’s George Polk career-award speech critical of Charlie Hebdo, I asked 15 top cartoonists about where their own satirical “red lines” stand since the Hebdo massacre. Now, we see that members of PEN are similarly divided. On May 5, Charlie Hebdo is due to receive the PEN American Center’s annual Freedom of Expression Courage award, as presented to Hebdo editor-in-chief Gerard Biard and staffer Jean-Baptiste Thoret in a Manhattan ceremony. But now, the “PEN Award 6,” if you will — novelists Peter Carey, Michael Ondaatje, Francine Prose, Teju Cole, Rachel Kushner and Taiye Selasi — are withdrawing from the event because of the Hebdo award, reports the New York Times. In withdrawing Friday, Kushner cited the French satirical weekly’s “cultural intolerance” and promotion of “a kind of forced secular view,” the Times reports — sentiments similar to those of the five other authors. And again, it bears repeating: Their words are not conflating Hebdo’s satirical practice with the horror and tragedy of January’s massacre at Hebdo’s Paris offices that left 12 dead, including five cartoonists. Judging by statements, this is not some broad-brush, “they had it coming” belief. (As Prose told the Associated Press, she “deplored” the killings, but can’t abide the honor’s implied “admiration and respect” for the Hebdo cartoons.) At issue, instead, is whether Charlie Hebdo is to be piously honored as a symbol of free speech. Carey is among those who essentially believe that Hebdo was “punching down” in its satire toward Islam. As he noted in a Times interview: “All this is complicated by PEN’s seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognize its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.” Vocally standing on the other side of this dividing line, however, is Salman Rushdie, he of the infamous fatwa over “The Satanic Verses.” Rushdie, a former PEN president, said his old friends Ondaatje and Carey are “horribly wrong,” stating: “If PEN as a free-speech organization can’t defend and celebrate people who have been murdered for drawing pictures, then frankly the organization is not worth the name.” (And it’s worth noting: The PEN leadership says membership has surged since the massacre.) [Would you run Charlie Hebdo’s Muhammad cartoons? Pew poll says: Depends on which of these demographic boxes you check] So now, amid this divide, we can expect organizations to examine more deeply than they might have what it means, exactly, to hand a plaque to surviving Hebdo staffers. Is an awarding group celebrating the magazine’s satiric philosophy — does a trophy tacitly applaud Hebdo’s content? Or does a statuette purely honor the principle of free speech as an absolute? And does such an award — as it did at January’s Angouleme comic-art festival — function largely as a memorial to lost lives. Yet again, event after vocal event, where will legacy-shaping influencers draw that demarcation: Will Charlie Hebdo mostly be upheld as a free-speech champion in the line of duty, or did the magazine’s satire toward Islamic targets, especially, cross a moral line? Or, perhaps, can both ideas, and outcomes, be held in our heads as independently true? In the heat of so many black-and-white arguments, after all, even some Charlie Hebdo artists paint with areas of gray. Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury” strip in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack: Writer/artist/visual storyteller Michael Cavna is creator of the \\"Comic Riffs\\" column and graphic-novel reviewer for The Post's Book World. He relishes sharp-eyed satire in most any form. Summary:","output":"Six authors, including Peter Carey and Michael Ondaatje, have withdrawn from the Pen America Center event on May 5, where Charlie Hebdo is due to receive the annual Freedom of Expression Courage award. The authors cited the French satirical weekly's \\"cultural intolerance\\" and promotion of \\"a kind of forced secular view\\" as their reasons for not participating. Salman Rushdie, former PEN president, has disagreed with the authors' withdrawal, stating that celebrating and defending those who have been murdered for drawing pictures aligns with PEN's role as a free-speech organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.  He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...

After securing the \\"Quantum Trigger,\\" Luthor and the Jester attempt to escape, but an alarm makes them realise the Syndicate are approaching. The Jester sacrifices himself with a bomb to allow Luthor a chance to get away, killing J'edd J'arkus (the Martian Manhunter's opposite) and Angelique (Hawkgirl's counterpart) who has just stabbed him with her flaming sword, in the process. Lex Luthor is confronted by the remaining Syndicate members, only to activate his dimensional travel device and escape to the Earth of the heroic Justice League, they are delayed thinking his device is a weapon. Once there, he turns himself over to the police, who he knows will think he's the evil Luthor from this world and thereby summon the Justice League. Superman's x-ray vision confirms Lex Luthor's reversed organs mean that he's from a parallel Earth, and that \\"their\\" Lex Luthor is still in the Stryker's Island prison, so the League agrees to hear Lex out. Lex tells his story and asks the League for help: his Earth is being extorted by the Syndicate, who have taken control of all of Earth and systematically eliminated Luthor's Justice League members. The only thing holding them in check is the threat of a nuclear response. While waiting outside the League's meeting room, he hides the Quantum Trigger. All members of the League agree, except for Batman, who argues that the League is spread too thin for the problems of their own world, let alone Luthor's. Luthor transports the remaining members of the League to his universe, while Batman stays behind to finish building the Watchtower. Arriving at Justice League headquarters on Lex's parallel Earth, they find the Syndicate and must soon retreat. Regrouping at Jester's base, they make plans to attack Syndicate targets, and they even capture Ultraman, the villainous counterpart to Superman. However, United States...","output":"President Slade Wilson, who is aware of the existence of the Crime Syndicate, frees Ultraman to maintain the balance of power. The Justice League is disappointed by this turn of events but remains undeterred in their mission. They split up to target multiple Syndicate bases, obtain the Quantum Trigger, and attempt to find a way to dismantle the Syndicate's stranglehold on this Earth. Wonder Woman and Firestorm take on Superwoman and find out that her alternate universe counterpart is, in fact, the superhero Wonder Woman's twin sister, Donna Troy. The Flash and Green Lantern face off against Johnny Quick, who is the Crime Syndicate's evil version of the Flash. Meanwhile, Martian Manhunter confronts and defeats the Martian Manhunter's evil counterpart, J'edd J'arkus, who had actually survived the bomb explosion. The Justice League eventually learns that Owlman, the evil counterpart of Batman, has secretly been controlling the Crime Syndicate and planning to use the inter-dimensional device to destroy Earth Prime, the original and central Earth from which all other alternate Earths diverged. His twisted reasoning is that since there are infinite Earths in which every possibility exists, nothing truly matters, and destroying Earth Prime will erase all life across the multiverse. Back in the Justice League's home universe, Batman completes the Watchtower but realizes the potential danger that Owlman poses. He uses Lex Luthor's inter-dimensional transport device to join the other League members in the alternate universe. Batman and the Justice League then confront Owlman, who has transported himself and the weapon to Earth Prime. Batman pursues Owlman to Earth Prime and defeats him, preventing him from detonating the Quantum Trigger and ending all existence across the multiverse. In the end, the Justice League returns to their Earth, having saved countless alternate Earths, including Lex Luthor's. However, Owlman's motivations and actions serve as a stark reminder of the delicate balance and responsibility that comes with great power and the fight for justice. The League gains a deeper understanding of their role as protectors and the potential for darkness even in alternate versions of themselves. In conclusion, in the movie 'Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths', the League battles the Crime Syndicate, evil counterparts from a parallel Earth controlled by them. This conflict forces the Justice League to confront the darker aspects of their own powers, serves as a lesson in responsibility and the need for balance, and ultimately strengthens their resolve to protect justice across the multiverse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which entity is this text about? Toru Takemitsu (Wu Man  Che , Takemitsu Toru, October 8, 1930 - February 20, 1996) pronounced [takemitsW to:rW] was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. In 1948, Takemitsu conceived the idea of electronic music technology, or in his own words, to \\"bring noise into tempered musical tones inside a busy small tube.\\" During the 1950s, Takemitsu had learned that in 1948 \\"a French [engineer] Pierre Schaeffer invented the method(s) of musique concrete based on the same idea as mine. I was pleased with this coincidence.\\"  In 1951, Takemitsu was a founding member of the anti-academic Jikken Kobo (Shi Yan Gong Fang , \\"experimental workshop\\"): an artistic group established for multidisciplinary collaboration on mixed-media projects, who sought to avoid Japanese artistic tradition. The performances and works undertaken by the group introduced several contemporary Western composers to Japanese audiences. During this period he wrote Saegirarenai Kyusoku I (\\"Uninterrupted Rest I\\", 1952: a piano work, without a regular rhythmic pulse or barlines); and by 1955 Takemitsu had begun to use electronic tape-recording techniques in such works as Relief Statique (1955) and Vocalism A*I (1956). Takemitsu also studied in the early 1950s with the composer Fumio Hayasaka, perhaps best known for the scores he wrote for films by Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa, the latter of whom Takemitsu would collaborate with decades later.  In the late 1950s chance brought Takemitsu international attention: his Requiem for string orchestra (1957  listen ), written as an homage to Hayasaka, was heard by Igor Stravinsky in 1958 during his visit to Japan. (The NHK had organised opportunities for Stravinsky to listen to some of the latest Japanese music; when Takemitsu's work was put on by mistake, Stravinsky insisted on hearing it to the end.) At a press conference later, Stravinsky expressed his admiration for the work, praising its \\"sincerity\\" and \\"passionate\\" writing. Stravinsky subsequently invited Takemitsu to lunch; and for Takemitsu this was an \\"unforgettable\\" experience. After Stravinsky returned to the U.S., Takemitsu soon received a commission for a new work from the Koussevitsky Foundation which, he assumed, had come as a suggestion from Stravinsky to Aaron Copland. For this he composed Dorian Horizon, (1966), which was premiered by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Copland.","output":"This text is about Toru Takemitsu, a renowned Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory who was born on October 8, 1930, and passed away on February 20, 1996.

As a part number is an identifier of a part design (independent of its instantiations), a serial number is a unique identifier of a particular instantiation of that part design. In other words, a part number identifies any particular (physical) part as being made to that one unique design; a serial number, when used, identifies a particular (physical) part (one physical instance), as differentiated from the next unit that was stamped, machined, or extruded right after it. This distinction is not always clear, as natural language blurs it by typically referring to both part designs, and particular instantiations of those designs, by the same word, \`\`part(s)''. Thus if you buy a muffler of P/N 12345 today, and another muffler of P/N 12345 next Tuesday, you have bought \`\`two copies of the same part'', or \`\`two parts'', depending on the sense implied. Is it true that is part number the same as serial number?","output":"No, a part number and a serial number are not the same. While they may seem similar, they both serve different purposes in identifying and differentiating parts. A part number is an identifier for a specific part design. It represents the unique design, specifications, and features of a particular part. All instances (physical units) of a part with the same part number will have the same design and specifications, making it easier for manufacturers, suppliers, and customers to identify, order, and replace it when needed. Essentially, the part number is like a blueprint that ensures consistency in manufacturing and maintenance processes regardless of when or where the part was produced. On the other hand, a serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a single instantiation (physical unit) of a part made from the same design. Serial numbers differentiate between individual units of a part, allowing for effective tracking, quality control, and traceability throughout the part's life. For example, if there is a defect or recall on a specific batch of parts, the serial number helps pinpoint the exact units affected, making it easier for manufacturers to address the issue. In summary, while both part numbers and serial numbers are used to identify parts, a part number is used to identify and describe the design of a part, while a serial number differentiates between individual units of that part. Consequently, part numbers ensure consistency in design and specifications, while serial numbers support traceability, tracking, and quality control at the unit level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's unfortunate to hear that your experience with this girl was negative. It's essential to recognize that people can sometimes be deceptive or lie, regardless of their gender. While it is true that some girls may say things they do not mean, we must also consider that this is a trait found among people in general. Miscommunication can be a common issue in relationships or friendships, and it's crucial to develop trust and understanding to overcome these obstacles. When someone tells you something that turns out not to be true, it can be a hurtful experience. However, it's equally important not to generalize negative experiences with one person to the entire gender. In your specific situation, when the girl you were talking to lied about being rich, it may have been essential to consider her motives for doing so. People may lie for various reasons, including insecurity, seeking attention, or even to protect themselves. It is essential to approach these situations with compassion, empathy, and a willingness to understand the underlying reasons.

Write a summary based on this article: Researchers have uncovered animal bones, flint tools, and evidence of burning that predates the first stones at Stonehenge by nearly 5,000 years. Here, an animal bone, with a point still in it      Editor's Note: This story was updated April 24 at 10:20 a.m. ET.      A site near Stonehenge has revealed archaeological evidence that hunters lived just a mile from Stonehenge roughly 5,000 years prior to the construction of the first stones, new research suggests.      What's more, the site, which was occupied continuously for 3,000 years, had evidence of burning, thousands of flint tool fragments and bones of wild aurochs , a type of extinct giant cow. That suggests the area near Stonehenge may have been an auroch migration route that became an ancient feasting site, drawing people together from across different cultures in the region, wrote lead researcher David Jacques of the Open University in the United Kingdom, in an email.      \\"We may have found the cradle of Stonehenge, the reason why it is where it is,\\" Jacques wrote. [In Photos: A Walk Through Stonehenge]      The new discovery may also identify the people who first erected structures at Stonehenge. A few gigantic pine posts, possibly totem poles, were raised at Stonehenge between 8,500 and 10,000 years ago, but until now there was scant evidence of occupation in the area that long ago. The new research suggests those ancient structures may perhaps have been raised to honor a sacred hunting ground.      Mysterious monument      For decades, people have wondered at the enigmatic stone structures erected roughly 5,000 years ago in the plains of Wiltshire, England. No one knows why ancient people built the structure: some believe it was a place of ancient worship or a sun calendar, whereas still others think it was a symbol of unity or even that Stonehenge was inspired by a sound illusion.      The large megaliths, known as sarsens, are up to 30 feet tall and weigh up to 25 tons, while the smaller bluestones weigh up to 4 tons. Researchers think the giant boulders came from a quarry near Marlborough Downs, just 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the iconic site, while the bluestones likely came from Preseli Hills in Wales, nearly 156 miles (250 km) away from Stonehenge.      Old photographs      Jacques was looking through archival photographs of the region surrounding Stonehenge when he spotted a site known as Vespasian's Camp, just a mile from Stonehenge in nearby Amesbury.      Realizing that it hadn't been fully surveyed, Jacques began to investigate the area, which harbored a freshwater spring.      Because animals like to stop and drink at such watering holes, Jacques wondered whether ancient man may have settled nearby as well.      The team uncovered roughly 350 animal bones and 12,500 flint tools or fragments, as well as lots of evidence of burning. Carbon dating suggested the area was occupied by humans from 7500 B.C. to 4700 B.C. — roughly 5,000 years prior to the erection of the first stones at Stonehenge. [See Photos of the Stonehenge Hunting Ground ]      \\"The spring may have originally attracted large animals to it, which would have aided hunting and may have led to associations that the area was a sacred hunting ground,\\" Jacques wrote.      In addition, the researchers found tools made from stone from one region of England, but fashioned in the style of another region (for instance, a stone tool made from Welsh or Cornwall slate, but made in a style typical of Sussex). That suggests the people from different regions were coming together at the site, Jacques wrote.      Ancient builders?      The findings could help researchers pinpoint why the ancient builders of Stonehenge chose the place they did, Jacques said.      \\"We have found a bridge from which transmission of cultural memory about the 'specialness' of the place where the stones were later being put up was possible,\\" Jacques wrote. \\"We are getting closer to understanding their reasons for putting it up — it is all to do with ancestors, but those ancestors go much further back than has previously been realised.\\"      The findings show \\"there was a substantial interest in the Stonehenge landscape well before the stones were hauled there and erected,\\" said Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in the U.K., who was not involved in the study.      Excavations dating to 2008 at Stonehenge also confirm earlier use at the megalithic site, Darvill wrote. However, what makes the Amesbury discovery special is the large trove of auroch bones found in the area, which suggests the spring was on a natural migration route for the wild aurochs, he said.      A program about the Amesbury site will air on BBC 4 on April 29.      Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter @tiaghose. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

The location, believed to have been inhabited continuously for over 3,000 years, showed evidence of burning and numerous remnants of flint tools and auroch bones - giant extinct cows which suggest that the area was a migration route and meeting place for various ancient communities. Head researcher, David Jacques, suggests that the site may be the reason for Stonehenge's placement. Additionally, they discovered stone tools made in different regions, which reinforces the idea that people from various regions met here. This new evidence could potentially change our understanding of why Stonehenge was created.  Separately, Stonehenge and other historic properties are managed by English Heritage, which is currently searching for a general manager to lead the sites into a \\"new era.\\" The successful individual will be responsible for a team of over 80 employees and 100 volunteers, and manage visitor experiences and events.

As the ensemble cast navigates the trials and tribulations of high school with a fittingly humorous tone, viewers will find themselves both cringing and laughing at their relatable antics. One of the strengths of this movie lies in its truly unique, eccentric, and assorted characters.

This marks a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to prosecute those responsible for aiding and encouraging terrorism and radicalization. This article delves into the background of the recruiter, details of the case, and the broader implications for counterterrorism efforts. Background of the ISIS Recruiter The recruiter in question, whose identity remains undisclosed for security reasons, is believed to have played a pivotal role in the Islamic State's recruitment network across Europe, particularly in enticing and facilitating the journey of British nationals to Syria. This individual operated both online and in person, exploiting social media platforms as well as direct contact to radicalize vulnerable, disillusioned individuals. According to investigations, the recruiter sympathized with the extremist ideologies espoused by the Islamic State, sharing the group's toxic narrative and vision of a so-called caliphate. By instilling loyalty to this cause, the recruiter was able to strengthen his network, seeking out individuals susceptible to such extremist rhetoric. Details of the Case The recent court hearing revealed the recruiter's involvement in the attempted journeys of two British citizens who were caught attempting to travel to Syria. Evidence gathered by authorities exposed that the recruiter had provided the would-be jihadis with logistical support, navigational advice, and connections to other operatives to ensure their safe passage. Additionally, it was found that the recruiter had helped these individuals acquire necessary, yet falsified, documentation to travel. The British Security Forces' quick and seamless coordination to detain these individuals highlighted the effectiveness of cooperation between intelligence agencies and the criminal justice system in ensuring the swift apprehension of those affiliated with terror cells. This symbiotic relationship is essential to identifying and disrupting potential threats before they can materialize. Implications for Counterterrorism Efforts This conviction sends a strong message to those who consider supporting terrorism or acting upon extremist ideologies that they will be held accountable for their actions. By prosecuting individuals like this recruiter, the United Kingdom demonstrates its hope to deter potential offenders and reinforce the harsh consequences of engaging in terrorist activities. Furthermore, the case reflects the necessity for a multifaceted approach to counterterrorism. This involves understanding the appeal and recruitment strategies of terrorist organizations like the Islamic State, while continually adapting and enhancing tactics designed to prevent radicalization and the proliferation of violent extremism. Closing Thoughts The conviction of the ISIS recruiter marks a significant stepping stone in the unrelenting battle against terrorism and radicalization. This outcome emphasizes that the British Justice System will not tolerate individuals who seek to undermine the security and stability of its citizens through the proliferation of toxic, violent ideologies. Ultimately, the pursuit of justice in cases like these remains critical to safeguard our society from the threat of terrorism, undoubtedly enhancing the safety and well-being of future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the purpose: Determine the specific purpose for which the item needs to be sweetened. Is it for a dessert, a beverage, or enhancing the taste of a savory dish? Understanding the purpose helps to choose the appropriate sweetening alternative. 2. Consider options: Based on the purpose, think of various alternatives to honey that are suitable for sweetening. Some common options include sugar (white, brown, or powdered), maple syrup, agave nectar, stevia, artificial sweeteners (like sucralose, aspartame, or saccharin), molasses, or fruit-based sweeteners (like applesauce, mashed bananas, or dates). 3. Assess taste preferences and dietary restrictions: Consider the taste preferences of those who will consume the sweetened item, as well as any possible dietary restrictions or allergies (e.g., vegan, diabetic, or low-calorie). This could affect the choice of sweeteners to be used. 4. Quantity and sweetness ratio: Determine the appropriate quantity of the chosen sweetener to add to your dish or beverage. Take into account that different sweeteners have different sweetness levels in comparison to honey, so it's important to adjust the amount accordingly to achieve the desired sweetness. 5. Application: Add the chosen sweetener to the item you want to sweeten by either dissolving it in a liquid (such as a beverage or sauce) or incorporating it into a solid mixture (such as dough or batter). Be sure to mix it well to ensure that the sweetness is evenly distributed throughout the item. 6. Taste and adjust: Once the sweetener has been added, taste the item to check the sweetness level. If needed, adjust the sweetness by adding more of the chosen sweetener or a different one until the desired taste is achieved. 7. Serve and enjoy: Once the item has been sweetened to taste, it's ready to be served and enjoyed. By following these steps, you can successfully sweeten something without using honey, while still maintaining a delicious, satisfying taste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (Reuters) - Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Muslim cleric known as “the blind sheikh” who was convicted of conspiracy in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and of planning a broader “war of urban terrorism” in the United States, died on Saturday in a North Carolina prison, authorities said.      Abdel-Rahman, 78, died of natural causes at 9:40 a.m. (1440 GMT) at a medical center at a federal prison compound in Butner, North Carolina, according to Greg Norton, a spokesman.      The cleric, who had diabetes and coronary artery disease, had been incarcerated at the complex for nearly 10 years, Norton said.      Earlier, the cleric’s son Ammar said his family had received a phone call in Eygpt from a U.S. representative saying his father had died.      The Egyptian-born Abdel-Rahman remained a spiritual leader for radical Muslims even after more than 20 years in prison.      With his long gray beard, sunglasses and red and white clerical cap, the charismatic Abdel-Rahman was the face of radical Islam in the 1980s and 1990s. He preached a fiery brand of Islam that called for the death of people and governments he disapproved of and the installation of an Islamic government in Egypt. His following was tied to fundamentalist killings and bomb attacks around the world.      “Abdel-Rahman was at the vortex of some of the bloodiest and most consequential terrorist incidents of the 1990s - incidents that would establish the patterns of global terrorism that continue to bedevil us today,” said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington.      “He was a tireless and enthusiastic in projecting his message of violence and hatred,” said Hoffman, who served on the U.S. government’s commission that reviewed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington and over Pennsylvania.      Abdel-Rahman, who was born in a village along the Nile on May 3, 1938, lost his eyesight due to childhood diabetes and grew up studying a Braille version of the Koran.      As an adult he became associated with the fundamentalist Islamic Group and was imprisoned and accused of issuing a fatwa leading to the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, against whom he had railed for years. The sheikh said he was hung upside-down from the ceiling, beaten with sticks and given electric shocks while held but he was eventually acquitted and went into self-imposed exile in 1990.      He managed to get to New York after the U.S. Embassy in Sudan granted him a tourist visa in 1990 - despite the fact that he was on the State Department’s list of people with ties to terror groups.      U.S. authorities blamed a computer error for the visa, but the mistake was compounded in 1991 when Abdel-Rahman was given a green card and permanent U.S. resident status. The New York Times reported the CIA had approved the visa application for Abdel-Rahman, who had supported the anti-Soviet mujahedin in Afghanistan during the 1980s.      Abdel-Rahman preached his radical message and lived in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and nearby Jersey City, New Jersey, building a strong following among fundamentalist Muslims. Even in exile, he remained a force in the Middle East, where followers listened to cassette tapes and radio broadcasts of his sermons decrying the Egyptian government and Israel.      While in the United States Abdel-Rahman and his disciples would be linked to the 1990 slaying in New York of militant Rabbi Meir Kahane, the 1992 killing of an anti-fundamentalist writer in Egypt and attacks on foreign tourists in Egypt.      U.S. authorities took action in 1992 by revoking Abdel-Rahman’s green card on the grounds that he had lied about a bad check charge in Egypt and about having two wives when he entered the country. He was facing the possibility of deportation when a truck bomb went off in the basement parking garage of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000 in an attack that made Americans realize that they were not immune to international terrorism.      Four months later Abdel-Rahman was arrested and went on trial with several followers in 1995, accused of plotting a day of terror for the United States - assassinations and synchronized bombings of the U.N. headquarters, a major federal government facility in Manhattan and tunnels and a bridge linking New York City and New Jersey.      The indictment said Abdel-Rahman and his followers planned to “levy a war of urban terrorism against the United States” as part of a jihad - or holy war - to stop U.S. support for Israel and change its overall Middle East policy.      The defendants were not directly charged with the 1993 World Trade Center attack but were convicted of conspiring with those who did carry out the bombing.      Abdel-Rahman’s convictions also included plotting to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a visit to the United States in 1993, a Jewish New York state legislator and a Jewish New York State Supreme Court justice.      Much of the case against Abdel-Rahman and his followers was based on video and audio recordings made with the help of a bodyguard for the sheikh who became an FBI informant. A video also showed four defendants mixing fertilizer and diesel fuel for bombs.      After a nine-month trial, the sheikh and nine followers were found guilty in October 1995 on 48 of 50 charges.      He did not testify at his trial but at a sentencing hearing Abdel-Rahman gave a passionate speech of more than 90 minutes through a translator, proclaiming his innocence and denouncing the United States as an enemy of his faith.      Egyptian Omar Abdel-Rahman speaks during a news conference in this still image taken from February 1993 video footage on January 18, 2013. REUTERS/Reuters TV/Files      “I have not committed any crime except telling people about Islam,” he said.      Abdel-Rahman was still an important figure in radical Islam even after years in prison. A year before his al Qaeda followers pulled off the most destructive assault on U.S. soil, the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Osama bin Laden had pledged a jihad to free Abdel-Rahman from prison. When Mohammed Mursi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, began his short-lived presidency of Egypt in 2012, he said winning the sheikh’s freedom would be a priority and the jihadists who attacked an Algerian oilfield and took hostages in 2013 also demanded his release.      In 2006 one of Abdel-Rahman’s lawyers, Lynne F. Stewart, was sentenced to 28 months in prison for helping smuggle messages from the cleric to his followers in Egypt. ||||| FILE - This April 6, 1993 file photo shows Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman in New York.

(AP) — Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik convicted of plotting terror attacks in the United States in the 1990s, has died. He was 78.      Kenneth McKoy of the Federal Correction Complex in Butner, North Carolina, said Rahman died at 5:40 a.m. after suffering from diabetes and coronary artery disease. Abdul-Rahman had been at the complex for seven years.      Rahman was a key spiritual leader for a generation of Islamic militants and became a symbol for radicals during a decade in American prisons.      Abdel-Rahman, blind since infancy from diabetes, was the leader of one of Egypt's most feared militant groups, the Gamaa Islamiya, which led a campaign of violence aimed at bringing down ex-President Hosni Mubarak.      Abdel-Rahman fled Egypt to the U.S. in 1990 and began teaching in a New Jersey mosque. A circle of his followers were convicted in the Feb. 26, 1993 truck bombing of New York's World Trade Center that killed six people — eight years before al-Qaida's suicide plane hijackers brought the towers down.      Later in 1993, Abdel-Rahman was arrested for conspiracy to carry out a string of bombings against the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and other New York landmarks. |||||Summary:","output":"Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Muslim cleric known as \\"the blind sheikh\\" who was convicted of conspiracy in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and of planning a broader \\"war of urban terrorism\\" in the United States, died aged 78 on 18 February in a North Carolina prison due to natural causes.

Based on the information provided, it is clear that the jungle rambles are considered enjoyable because of the wealth of wildlife that the surrounding forests have to offer. This can be deduced from the statement, \\"the wealth of wildlife makes jungle rambles particularly enjoyable.\\" The presence of several nature trails is indicative of the fact that visitors or tourists are drawn to the area to engage in outdoor activities, such as hiking, trekking, or exploring the diverse flora and fauna. Moreover, the mention of these trails being marked out suggests that there is a level of organisation and preparation put into ensuring that guests or adventurers have a positive and fulfilling experience while navigating through the jungle. Having marked trails makes accessibility easier and, consequently, more enjoyable for people who want to explore the surrounding forests and encounter the abundant wildlife.

Question: Who does Napoleon and Kip live with? Movie title: Napoleon Dynamite Movie plot: Preston High School was one of the filming locations for the movie. Napoleon Dynamite is a socially awkward 16-year-old boy from Preston, Idaho, who lives with his older brother, Kiplin Ronald \\"Kip\\" Dynamite, and their grandmother. Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours in Internet chat rooms with \\"babes\\" and aspiring to be a cage fighter; their grandmother leads a secret life involving mysterious boyfriends and quad-biking in the desert. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, doodling ligers and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock, Don. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself whilst having a sullen and aloof attitude. Napoleon's grandmother breaks her coccyx in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former athlete who lives in a campervan, treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme to sell numerous items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the loss of his girlfriend. Napoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college; and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. A friendship soon develops between the three outcasts. During this time, preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Deb to be his dance partner, which she accepts, while Napoleon chooses and attempts to persuade a reluctant classmate called Trisha to be his own date. Inspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl at the school. The two factions put up flyers and give out accessories to the students to attract voters. Kip, meanwhile, is head-over-heels...

Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Moore said he had been following Bhutto's story since her return to Pakistan in October. He was present October 19 when a terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi killed 136 people. In the aftermath of that attack, \\"The rallies had been very small,\\" because of high security, Moore said.

The second was the provision for the conscription of every male Prussian of military age in the event of mobilization.

School bus makers and industry watchers doubt the possibility of these new standards, saying that hiking costs would make school buses unaffordable in rural China.The US-modeled standards also mean that most smaller bus makers will be kept out from the market. These views, however, have aroused anger among netizens who are questioning \\"why can't we enjoy US standards when it comes to human lives?\\" Similar debates keep taking place.China falls behind the US on various standards--air quality measurement, mine safety, milk safety and so on.The idea is highly attractive that China presses on with adapting advanced US standards and improves all unsatisfying aspects of social life.However, this is far more complex than drawing up documents on paper. Some standards today were unimaginable just a few years ago.But public demand for using better standards from developed countries is on the rise.The government has to learn from them and keep pushing for higher standards.Adopting PM 2.5 in air quality monitoring follows  _ .

Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the \\"Watchers\\", confined on Earth as stone golems (nephilim) for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. Once a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an ark. After birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are put to sleep with incense. With Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth, but upon witnessing the settlers' exchanging their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the creator wants all of humanity dead. Back at the ark, he tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations. Devastated that he will be alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but, when he will not, she goes to Methuselah for help. Later, in the forest, Ila...

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: make crisp french fries","output":"To determine the best solution for making crisp French fries, I will compare two popular methods: deep frying and baking. I will consider factors such as taste, texture, and ease of preparation. Deep Frying: 1. Peel and cut the potatoes into even-sized fries. 2. Soak the fries in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps achieve a crispy texture. 3. Drain the water and pat the fries dry with a paper towel. Removing excess water prevents splattering during frying. 4. Preheat the oil to 325°F (163°C) in a deep fryer or a deep, heavy pot. 5. Fry the fries in small batches to avoid crowding and ensure even cooking, lightly browning them for 5-6 minutes. 6. Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Allow them to cool for a few minutes. 7. Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C). Refry the fries for a second time until they are crisp and golden brown, around 2-3 minutes. 8. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and season with salt. Baking: 1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C) and position racks in the middle and upper third of the oven. 2. Peel and cut the potatoes into even-sized fries. 3. Soak the fries in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. 4. Drain the water and pat the fries dry with a paper towel. 5. Toss the fries in a bowl with a small amount of oil and seasoning. 6. Spread the fries on two baking sheets in a single layer, ensuring they are not touching to promote even cooking. 7. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning the fries and rotating the sheets halfway through, until the fries are golden brown and crisp. Conclusion: While both methods have their merits, deep frying is better for achieving consistently crisp French fries. The process of double frying at different temperatures ensures a crispy exterior and a tender interior while also providing the distinct flavor and texture associated with restaurant-quality fries. Baking can yield satisfactory results, but it may require more effort to achieve a consistently crispy texture throughout the entire batch. Additionally, baking does not provide the same level of the satisfying crunch commonly associated with deep-fried French fries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   38.4 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation–contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces.   Q: The body contains how many types of muscle tissue?

Options: - apartment - living room - bedroom - kitchen - cabinet Answer:","output":"The most suitable option for storing and hiding a television would be a cabinet. Cabinets provide an ideal solution for concealing electronic devices like televisions when not in use, especially if you want to create a streamlined and clutter-free look in your living space.  Cabinets come in a variety of sizes, styles, and materials, offering many possibilities to suit your personal taste and the decor of your home. You can choose a cabinet that complements your existing furniture and matches the overall design theme of your room.  There are many types of cabinets specifically designed to store and hide televisions, such as TV lift cabinets or TV armoire cabinets. TV lift cabinets are equipped with a motorized mechanism that lifts the television into view when in use and lowers the TV back into the cabinet when not in use. TV armoire cabinets feature doors that can be opened to reveal the television and closed to hide it when not in use. Apart from these specialized cabinets, you can also use a regular cabinet to store your television. Depending on the size and design of the cabinet, you can either mount the TV on the wall inside the cabinet or place the TV on a shelf. When the doors are closed, the television will be concealed from view. This approach allows for more flexibility in terms of positioning the cabinet in your preferred room and reusing the cabinet for other purposes if needed. In summary, a cabinet is the most suitable option for storing and hiding a television. It not only offers practical storage solutions but also allows you to maintain the aesthetic appeal of your living space. By selecting a cabinet that complements your home's design, you can create a harmonious visual effect while keeping your television concealed and ensuring a neat and organized look."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Bradley should not have said anything about Gore's campaign-finance practices.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be analyzed through the logical connections between the statements. In order to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, one needs to understand the implications of each statement separately and if the latter follows directly from the former. Let's first look at the premise: \\"Meanwhile, Bradley is taking heat for questioning Gore's campaign-finance practices.\\" This statement implies that Bradley, a figure involved in a particular political context, has raised a critical perspective on the campaign-finance practices employed by another political figure, Gore. Consequently, Bradley has faced backlash or criticism for making these accusations. Now consider the hypothesis: \\"Bradley should not have said anything about Gore's campaign-finance practices.\\" The hypothesis posits a normative judgment on Bradley's actions, suggesting that it would have been better if he had refrained from expressing his concerns about Gore's financial practices. To determine if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise, one must consider whether the fact that Bradley is taking heat for his accusations necessarily implies that he should not have made these allegations in the first place.  In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis for several reasons: 1. Different interpretations of the situation: The premise only provides information about the consequences of Bradley's actions (i.e., that he is facing criticism), but it does not directly imply whether or not those consequences were warranted. There may be other factors at play that could justify Bradley's decision to raise concerns about Gore's financial practices, even if it led to criticism. 2. Evaluation of risk and consequences: The fact that Bradley is taking heat for questioning Gore's campaign-finance practices does not necessarily imply that he should not have done so. Bradley may have considered and accepted the risks of potential backlash before making his allegations, believing that it was important to bring these issues to light and foster transparency in a political context. 3. Moral and ethical considerations: The hypothesis assumes that not receiving criticism is inherently more valuable than speaking out on potential wrongdoings. However, one could argue that Bradley has a moral or ethical responsibility to disclose information about potentially unethical practices, regardless of the backlash he may face. In conclusion, while the premise reveals that Bradley has faced a negative and perhaps unintended consequence for his actions, it does not entail the hypothesis that he should not have said anything about Gore's campaign-finance practices. The hypothesis suggests a normative judgment that cannot be directly deduced from the premise alone, as the premise does not provide enough information on the rationale, motivations, or potential justifications behind Bradley's decision to question Gore's practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  There is a fetus in the womb - They are born and are a baby - The baby grows into a child - Puberty turns the child into an adolescent - The adolescent becomes an adult - An adult becomes an elderly person The answer to this question is:","output":"The final step of the process after an adult becomes an elderly person is the stage of late adulthood, which ultimately leads to the end of one's life cycle. This phase can be described as follows: Late Adulthood: As individuals progress from their adult years into old age, they continue to mature and experience physical, emotional, social, and cognitive transformations. These changes can have numerous variations and characteristics, depending on one's lifestyle, genetics, and any health concerns that may arise. 1. Physical Changes: The aging process often results in a decrease in muscle mass, strength, and flexibility. Elderly individuals may also experience declining bone density, which can increase the risk of fractures. Additionally, there might be a reduced capacity of the various body systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as a decline in sensory abilities, such as vision and hearing. 2. Cognitive Changes: As individuals reach late adulthood, cognitive functions may decline in certain areas. Memory, processing speed, and problem-solving abilities tend to decline gradually over time. However, cognitive decline is not experienced by everyone to the same extent or rate. Some older adults maintain robust cognitive functioning throughout their golden years, while others may require additional support to perform daily tasks. 3. Emotional Changes: Emotional well-being is a critical aspect of late adulthood, and older individuals often exhibit extraordinary resilience, wisdom, and strength. Some elderly individuals may face life challenges, such as bereavement, loneliness, or health issues. The ability to adapt and cope with these challenges can significantly affect their emotional and mental well-being. 4. Social Changes: Social relationships may continue to evolve in late adulthood as older individuals encounter alterations in their roles and responsibilities. Retirement, grandparenthood, and the loss of friends or family members can generate significant changes in their social circle. Maintaining social connections is essential for overall well-being, as it can provide older adults with a sense of belonging and purpose. 5. Morality and Ethics: Late adulthood allows for a profound contemplation of life, moral values, and personal legacy. Elderly individuals may reflect on their lives, life choices, relationships, and the impact their actions have had on others. This process of introspection can lead to increased wisdom, understanding, compassion, and acceptance of life's complexities. End of the Life Cycle: As the journey of late adulthood progresses, the end of the life cycle approaches. Aging individuals may experience various end-of-life issues, such as preparing for death, managing pain, and discussing their wishes for their final days. The natural process of aging ultimately culminates in death, leading to the conclusion of one's life cycle. However, the legacy that individuals leave behind through their actions, relationships, and contributions to society lives on in the hearts and minds of those they have touched throughout their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   An elderly person has a higher or lower risk of developing a cardiovascular disease than a young person?    Text:  The older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease. Answer:","output":"Based on the given text, an elderly person has a higher risk of developing a cardiovascular disease than a younger person. The statement \\"the older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease\\" clearly indicates that as age increases, so does the likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular issues. This increased risk can be attributed to various age-related factors, such as the natural aging process of the heart and blood vessels. As a person ages, their arteries can become stiffer and less elastic, leading to a condition known as arteriosclerosis. This reduced elasticity can contribute to a higher risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension) and other cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and stroke. Additionally, with age, the heart muscle may become less efficient at pumping blood, leading to a decrease in cardiac output. This can result in the heart having to work harder to meet the body's demands for blood and oxygen. Over time, this extra strain on the heart can lead to the development of heart failure or other cardiovascular conditions. Moreover, the body's natural process of repairing and maintaining blood vessels can become less effective as a person ages. This can result in the build-up of plaque, or fatty deposits, on the inner walls of the arteries. This condition, known as atherosclerosis, can further contribute to cardiovascular diseases by obstructing blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Lifestyle factors also play a role in increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly individuals. Over the years, unhealthy behaviors like smoking, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption can accumulate and take a toll on one's cardiovascular health. As a result, these lifestyle choices can make elderly individuals more susceptible to developing heart-related conditions than their younger counterparts. Lastly, older individuals are more likely to have other medical conditions or diseases that can increase their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. These may include diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol levels, which can exacerbate existing heart conditions or contribute to the development of new ones. In conclusion, an elderly person has a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than a young person due to factors such as age-related changes in the heart and blood vessels, decreased vascular repair and maintenance, harmful lifestyle choices, and the presence of other age-related medical conditions. It is essential for individuals to be aware of these risks and take appropriate steps to maintain their cardiovascular health as they age."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" is \\"They thought the warship would create a larger explosion\\"?","output":"Based on the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" is \\"Because Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S. warship instead.\\" The reason for this change in target selection is not explicitly stated in the paragraph, but it can be inferred that Bin Laden chose this target for strategic or symbolic reasons rather than the size of the explosion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Given the background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  and the situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  Answer the following question: Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Answer:","output":"Item A, the Earth, would have a higher specific gravity compared to item B, the surface rock. The Earth's mean specific gravity is 5.515, whereas the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ranges from 2.7 to 3.3. This difference implies that the Earth's deeper material is denser than the surface rocks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.wordpress.android. Answer:","output":"Review Title: Unsatisfactory Experience with the WordPress Android Application Rating: 2/5 I'm offering a 2-star rating for the WordPress Android app, the package with the identifier org.wordpress.android, as my experience using it didn't quite meet expectations. The criteria I considered when giving this review revolve around four main aspects: functionality, user interface, reliability, and customer support. Unfortunately, all of these domains proved to be more problematic than I expected when I first downloaded the app.  Firstly, let's talk about functionality. The WordPress Android app is designed to provide an easy-to-use mobile interface for managing WordPress websites. While it does offer some useful features, such as the ability to publish new posts, manage comments, and view basic site stats, I regrettably found the overall functionality to be lacking compared to the desktop version. There are many advanced features, like plugins and complex theme setups, that this app partially or entirely fails to handle. It seems only to be nice for basic blogging but not for deeper customizations. On the topic of the user interface, it has not been particularly enjoyable to navigate either. It feels a bit clunky and unintuitive. The tools and options do not seem well-organized and at times, it seems harder to locate certain features without a lot of unnecessary clicking and scrolling. Furthermore, the editor's choice to place HTML and visual interfaces away from each other makes it challenging for users who integrate both into their workflow. The reliability factor of this app didn't impress me too much either. It has been prone to occasional crashes during use, which not only forced me to constantly save my progress to avoid losing any work but also significantly interrupted my workflow. The app occasionally logs me out unexpectedly, which is very inconvenient, especially when I'm in the middle of drafting or editing a post. Lastly, customer support has been a let-down as well. While user queries are responded to eventually, the responses are often delayed, and it seems there are more user complaints than the support team can handle. Also, many times, the solutions provided are either temporary or don’t address the root problem, indicating a lack of depth in understanding customer issues. However, despite my disappointments, I did find some merits in this application. The app allows preparing posts offline, which is a blessing when you're away from a steady internet connection. Also, it has a nice feature to directly upload photos from the phone gallery.  Even with these positives, it’s hard not to think that with some more thought and development work, the functionality of this app could significantly improve. I understand making a mobile platform work as well as a desktop version isn't easy, but given WordPress's reputation, my expectations were much higher.  Overall, my experience with the WordPress Android app has been less than ideal. While it isn't entirely unusable, it lacks the robustness I would have expected for managing and creating WordPress sites on the go. I hope the team behind the app will take criticisms into account and work towards improving the app's shortcomings. Until then, I would recommend users to manage their expectations when using this app."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Background: Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. Context: At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).  His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21.  In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976).  Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Question: What Olympic events did Hayes participate in?. Whats the answer?","output":"Bob Hayes participated in two events at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Second, Hayes was part of the United States' 4x100-meter relay team, where he won another gold medal and helped set a new world record with a time of 39.06 seconds. Hayes' incredible come-from-behind performance during the relay's anchor leg is widely considered one of the most memorable Olympic moments, with his hand-timed split between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds being the fastest relay leg in history. After these successes in the Olympics, Hayes decided to retire from track and field at the age of 21 and pursue his career in American football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Members of a gang who abused shoppers, threatened staff and chased children before ripping phones and iPads off walls in 42 stores across London have been jailed for a total of 11 years. CCTV footage from one attack on their £500,000 crime spree shows a mother sprinting to protect her terrified son as the eight men swamped and then burgled a Carphone Warehouse. On each occasion the criminals caused 'total mayhem' when they stormed high street shops to wrench high-value items from the walls in a series of violent 'steaming' raids. In scenes reminiscent of the recent London Riots, phones and tablet computers worth a total. of £143,000 were ripped out by the thieves, while the attacks caused more than £50,000. worth of damage. Scroll down for video. Terrifying: The gang are shown here dragging electronics from the walls of this Carphone Warehouse in a New Year's Eve raid last year. Aftermath: As they sprint for the door the trail of destruction the criminals left behind shows the violence and speed of their attacks. Violence: As the gang terrorise another store a mother is shown sweeping her young son away from them (bottom right) as they go on the rampage. The criminals, some of whom were just 14,. used the 'steaming' technique, where they rob shops or mug individuals by. swamping them and threatening them with violence. The clean-up operation after the raids, which forced some stores to close temporarily, resulted in Carphone Warehouse losing a total of more than £500,000, the court heard. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Testar said: 'This conspiracy to burgle consists of a series of offences in which a number of young men rushed into branches of Carphone Warehouse and simply grabbed whatever they were able to and ran away. 'In some cases, efforts were made to. disguise appearances, but in many cases the attitude of those who. committed these offences was brazen. 'Those. who have joined the conspiracy have applied themselves to a criminal. operation of which the overall effect was very great. 'The targeting of particular premises and the mob handed means of offending indicates greater harm. 'The success (of the conspiracy) depended on force of numbers and shock. 'Many staff and customers were very frightened. 'In. one incident, a small child found himself, much to his terror and that. of his parents, being surrounded by the marauding group. 'Most of the events saw participation by more than those who have admitted responsibility for them.' Sentenced: (Top L - Bottom R) Ugo Wilson, Jahreau Shepherd, Emmanuel Kakala, and Perry Hedges were part of the gang that raided 40 stores in a £500,000 crime spree across London. Judge Testar also praised the 'good old fashioned police work' involved in bringing the gang to justice. The 'steaming' spree took place between July 1, 2012 and January 11 this year, prosecutor Edward Lucas told the court. 'The. defendants had a total disregard for the presence of customers, old or. young, when they were embarking on their criminal enterprise. 'They were always mob handed and caused total chaos. Children were pushed out of the way and forced to run away. 'These. young men, of various ages, with the youngest being just 14 at the time. of the ending, targeted Carphone Warehouses through the London and. Greater London area. 'In. groups of three or more, they went into the premises, mostly during the. afternoon, and literally ripped telephones from their displays. 'The. shops were operating as normal and the staff were on duty at the time. serving customers, and of course they were terrified by what occurred. 'Children can be seen running for cover to their parents.' Horror: The frozen child is shown in the bottom right of the screen as the criminals pull electronics from the walls around him. Fear: A mother then tears across to protect the young boy from the marauding gang. Shocked shoppers who happened to get in the way of the enterprise were simply told to stand aside or else. 'There was a menace, don't mess with us, if you get in the way there is going to be trouble,' said Mr Lucas. 'The. staff say they were extremely shocked and frightened by what occurred. They were not only frightened for themselves but also for their. customers. 'The. psychological effect cannot be minimised and the reality is that the. consequences (for shop staff and' customers) have been profound. More thugs who took part in the raids remain at large and none of the goods have been recovered. 'The. fact of the matter is the crimes themselves seem to have occurred. within the context of the individuals really not caring who is in the. shop at the time. 'They went in to steal and caused total mayhem,' added Mr Lucas. Jahreau. Shepherd, 22, who was on licence for robbery at the time of the. attacks, was jailed for four years, while Ugo Wilson, 21, was given a. 27-month prison term. Ryan. Hopkins, 18, was handed a 12-month detention and training order, while. Perry Hedges, also 18, was locked up for 26 months in a young offenders' institute. Emanuel Kakala, 18, was handed a suspended 18-month prison sentence and was also ordered to complete 80 hours unpaid work. Samuel. Warnes, 20, was also spared jail with an 18 month prison sentence. suspended for 24 months. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours. unpaid work. All six admitted their part in the plot, together with two juveniles, aged 15 and 16, who cannot be named. They were each handed 10-month and 18-month detention and training orders respectively.

The story is about a cricket game and people playing, not a squirrel encountering an unrelated object or acting strangely. b). The option suggests that the squirrel and its owner are indoors, in the corner of a room playing, which contradicts the paragraph's setting of an outdoor cricket game.

Throughout a series of TV interviews, Romney sought to clarify his role at the private equity firm, insisting that he in fact retired from an active management role at Bain in February of 1999 and that his continued association with the firm was purely in the capacity of a shareholder. The issue of Romney's tenure at Bain Capital has become a focal point of the 2012 presidential campaign, with opponents of the Republican candidate using his association with the private equity firm to paint him as an out-of-touch millionaire who profited off the misery of others. The Obama campaign has specifically targeted Romney's record at Bain to highlight instances of layoffs and offshoring that occurred during his tenure, while also questioning the veracity of his claims that he left the firm in 1999. Speaking to CNN, Romney defended his association with Bain Capital, stating, \\"There's nothing wrong with being associated with Bain Capital, of course.\\" He reiterated that his departure from the firm took place in February 1999, despite documents listing him as holding key positions at Bain even after that date. To address these discrepancies, Romney told CBS, \\"I still retained an ownership interest. I had the capacity if I were not on leave, if I were actually wanting to run the business to do so, but I did not.\\" He further elucidated the distinction between playing an active management role and being a shareholder: “There is a difference between being a shareholder, an owner if you will, than a person who is running an entity.” Romney also went on the offensive against the Obama campaign's tactics during his media appearances. In response to an Obama adviser's suggestion that he could be guilty of a felony, Romney told ABC News, \\"This is simply beneath the dignity of the presidency of the United States.\\" He implored President Obama to \\"rein in his team\\" and \\"finally take responsibility for what they're saying,\\" during an interview with Fox News. “What kind of a president would have a campaign that says something like that about the nominee of another party?” he remarked. When asked if he believes Obama owes him an apology, Romney responded, \\"Absolutely—my goodness!\\" Politico and the AP provided comprehensive roundups of Romney's flurry of TV appearances, bringing the debate over his role at Bain Capital back into the spotlight. While this renewed focus on his tenure at the firm may prove troublesome for Romney's campaign, his decision to confront the issue head-on and demand an apology from his opponent demonstrates a willingness to take the fight to the president and defend his record as a businessman. As the presidential election approaches, it remains to be seen how these renewed discussions about Romney’s role at Bain Capital will impact his chances of winning the presidency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now they face being further sucked into trouble with a testing four-match run of three away games, starting at Neil Warnock's Cardiff this Saturday, and the visit to St Andrew's of Championship leaders Newcastle United, who knocked Zola's side out of the FA Cup after a replay in January. \\"Too many players are hiding,\\" Zola said. \\"But I am not going to hide from my responsibilities. This is an ambitious club and it deserves better.\\" After failing to earn a win in his first 10 league games in charge of Blues, it looked like Zola's side had turned a corner when they beat promotion-chasing Fulham at home on 4 February. But three more defeats then followed before Blues enjoyed their first away win under the Italian, the local derby win with 10 men against Wolves at Molineux. Although his side played very well for an hour and had enough chances to have won comfortably in Friday night's 3-1 home defeat by Leeds, Tuesday's 1-0 loss to Wigan was generally considered to be their worst performance of the entire campaign. They managed just two shots on target against a side in the relegation zone who had won just once in eight matches. Asked whether he would consider resigning, Zola admitted: \\"If some of the supporters feel the manager needs to change I totally understand that.\\" But, with 10 games of the season left, six of which are away from home, he said he needs time to assess the way forward for both him and the club. \\"It's too early to say something like that,\\" he added. \\"I don't want to consider it now.

Answer this question: what is the largest mountain free land area in europe??","output":"The largest mountain-free land area in Europe is the European Plain, sometimes referred to as the European Lowlands or the North European Plain. The European Plain spans across multiple countries, predominantly situated in the northern and central regions of the continent. It extends from the Atlantic coast of France in the west, through central Europe, to the Ural Mountains in Russia, which acts as the natural border of Eastern Europe. This vast, generally flat, lowland region covers an area that includes significant parts of several countries such as France, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, along with parts of Denmark, Belgium, Czech Republic, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). Moreover, it also covers a significant portion of eastern Russia, stretching almost 4,000 kilometers from west to east. The European Plain has a diverse climate, largely influenced by its vast size and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Temperatures vary widely across the region, with milder climates in the west and more continental climates towards the east. The plain experiences substantial precipitation due to westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean, creating fertile farmlands ideal for agriculture. The terrain of the European Plain ranges from gently rolling hills to entirely flat land, with elevations that do not surpass 200 meters above sea level. The region is characterized by several major rivers such as the Danube, Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and Vistula that shape the landscape and provide crucial water sources for human settlements and agriculture. Overall, this extensive plain is a topographical anomaly in a continent known for its diverse mountain ranges, such as the Alps, Carpathians, and Pyrenees. In conclusion, the largest mountain-free land area in Europe is the European Plain, which spans thousands of kilometers across various countries in the northern and central regions of the continent. This extensive, flat expanse of land encompasses numerous major rivers, supports diverse ecosystems, and is home to a significant portion of Europe's population due to its favorable conditions for agriculture and human habitation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Thornton's recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013. \\"Hound Dog\\" has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which is ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time. Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton's release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a \\"stomping uptempo boogie rocker\\", it began: \\"You ain't nothin' but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long\\". In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy recorded \\"Country Boy\\" accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\": \\"'Country Boy' has a deceptively slouching flip on the 'Hound Dog' motif - this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he 'ain't nothing but a country boy'\\".  In the early 1970s Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as \\"Hound Dog\\" called \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\" on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips' brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored.  When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP [in 1974], it was credited to Rosco Gordon. But it's not Rosco. It simply is not him. Really. Even Rosco confirmed that. It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo. Just substitute the words \\"Hound Dog\\" for \\"Juice Head\\" and what have you got? Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\" or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat\\". But the song's other parent is Eddie Vinson's slowed down \\"Juicehead Blues\\" which harks to the previous decade...If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen.\\"  Philip H. Ennis sees \\"Two Hound Dogs\\", which was recorded on May 10, 1955, by Bill Haley & His Comets (Decca 29552), as a response to Thornton's recording. While not an answer record in the traditional sense, the lyric characterized \\"Rhythm\\" and \\"Blues\\" as the titular \\"Two Hound Dogs,\\" an apparent testament to the stature of \\"Hound Dog.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who did the first riff off","output":"The first riff off of \\"Hound Dog\\" was done by Smiley Lewis in his song \\"Play Girl,\\" which was released by the end of March 1953. This is stated in the line: \\"The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953.\\" While the song used a similar melody, there was no attribution to Lieber and Stoller, the original writers of \\"Hound Dog\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My three sisters and I grew up in a small bedroom with two sets of beds. We shared a closet, a dresser, and just about everything else. I had friends who were only children. I looked longingly at their perfect dolls and toys placed carefully on their perfect shelves in their perfect little girl bedrooms. They had bathrooms to themselves. _ .

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

Question 1: What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an electoral college over a popular vote? Question 2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College? Select from the following. a). no. b). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. The Electoral College is an indirect method of selecting the President of the United States, wherein citizens vote for electors who then cast their votes on the citizens' behalf. A popular vote, on the other hand, directly counts the votes of citizens to determine the winner. Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of the Electoral College: 1. Balance of power: The Electoral College prevents highly populous states from dominating presidential elections. Since each state has a certain number of electors based on its number of Congressional representatives, smaller states still have a voice in the process. 2. Discourages election fraud: The Electoral College can make it more difficult for a candidate to win solely through election fraud. Attempts to fraudulently manipulate votes would need to happen across multiple states, making it more complex and harder to coordinate. 3. Decisive outcome: The Electoral College often produces clear winners and prompts presidential nominees to win a higher percentage of the popular vote in each state. This often means that the president-elect has a greater mandate to govern when they win under this system. 4. Promotes a two-party system: The Electoral College encourages a stable, two-party system by making it challenging for third-party candidates to win electoral votes. This helps ensure that candidates are more moderate and less likely to have extremist views. Disadvantages of the Electoral College: 1. Not directly reflective of popular will: The candidate with the most popular votes may not win the presidency because of the way electoral votes are allocated. This has happened multiple times in U.S. history, where the candidate winning the popular vote did not win the presidency. 2. Focus on swing states: Candidates mainly target battleground or swing states, where elections are closely contested. As a result, they may ignore the needs and concerns of citizens in states that are firmly aligned with one party or another. 3. Diminished voter motivation: Voters in non-swing states may feel their vote carries less weight, as their state's electoral vote outcome is relatively predetermined. This could lead to apathy and reduced voter turnout. 4. Disproportionate representation: The allocation of electoral votes gives greater weight to some states' votes due to the relationship between population size and the number of electors. Voters in smaller states have more influence per person than voters in larger states, which can create a disparity in representation. Advantages of a popular vote: 1. Equal representation: A popular vote does not prioritize any state or group of citizens, ensuring that every vote counts equally and making the process more democratic. 2. Nationwide campaign focus: Candidates would be encouraged to address the needs and concerns of all citizens across the country, rather than just battleground states. 3. Higher voter participation: Knowing that their vote carries equal weight, voters may be more likely to participate in the election process, increasing voter turnout and engagement. 4. Simplified vote counting: Directly counting the popular vote eliminates the need for complex Electoral College calculations, making the process simpler and more transparent. Disadvantages of a popular vote: 1. Potential for increased electoral fraud: With a single vote pool, a concentrated effort in one location could potentially sway the entire election outcome, making vote manipulation more impactful. 2. Disruption of the two-party system: The current two-party system, which provides stability in government, may be disrupted, leading to a rise in third-party candidates and potentially less moderation in viewpoints. 3. Close elections may create administrative challenges: In elections with tight margins, there may be an increased need for recounts and legal battles, which could delay the confirmation of the winner and generate uncertainty. 4. Urban focus: In a popular vote system, candidates might focus their campaigns on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the unique needs and concerns of rural and small-town citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Kai went back home. They forgot their wallet.  Given the question \\"What will Kai want to do next?\\", is \\"be less forgetful\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"\\"Be less forgetful\\" may be an overarching goal for Kai, but it does not directly address the immediate problem of forgetting their wallet at home. Therefore, while it's a valid concern related to the situation, it isn't a valid answer to the question, \\"What will Kai want to do next?\\".  A more appropriate answer should focus on how Kai can address the current issue of having left their wallet at home and the possible steps they might take. To provide a detailed and long answer, we can consider several scenarios based on the importance of having the wallet, the distance to their home, and other important factors. Immediate Action: If Kai has realized they forgot their wallet shortly after leaving home and they are not far away, they might want to go back and retrieve the wallet before proceeding with their plans. This would ensure that they have necessary identification, payment methods, and other items that might be in the wallet. Alternatives: If returning home is not an immediate option, Kai might consider alternative solutions based on their current needs. For instance, if they need to make a payment, they could find alternative means such as using a mobile payment app or borrowing money from a friend or family member. Safety Concern: Another consideration would be ensuring their wallet is secure. If Kai is worried that their wallet might be lost or stolen, they might want to call a family member or roommate to check if the wallet is safe at home. Also, they should keep an eye on their bank accounts and credit cards for any unusual activities. Planning Ahead: In case Kai is unable to resolve the situation immediately, they might need to plan their day accordingly. They could prioritize activities that do not require the wallet, such as visiting places where no payment or identification is needed, or rescheduling appointments that require identification for a later time. Preventive Measures for Future: As for addressing the issue of forgetfulness, Kai might consider adopting habits or strategies to avoid leaving important items behind. Some suggestions include having a designated place for their wallet, using reminder apps, or establishing a routine to double-check important items before leaving the house. In conclusion, while \\"be less forgetful\\" is a valid concern for Kai to address in the long term, it doesn't properly answer the question of what they would want to do next in this specific situation. Instead, focusing on immediate actions, safety concerns, alternatives, and plans for the day would provide a more accurate and actionable response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: practices by considering the scope of various types of audits and Here is a hypothesis: There is only one type of audit. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, we must analyze the statements provided and discuss their implications. First, let's break down the premise: \\"Practices by considering the scope of various types of audits.\\" This statement suggests that the approach one takes involves analyzing different types of audits. It implies that there is a variety of audit types with differing scopes. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"There is only one type of audit.\\" This statement contradicts the premise as it claims there is just a single type of audit. In other words, the hypothesis denies the existence of various audit types implied by the premise. Given the premise's indication that there are multiple audit types with varying scopes, it is not reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The contradiction between the premise and hypothesis suggests that they cannot both be accurate. If the premise is assumed to be true, claiming multiple types of audits, then the hypothesis, which asserts only one type of audit, must be false. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to accept that the hypothesis is true. The premise and hypothesis are in opposition, and one must be inaccurate if the other is deemed true. Therefore, if the premise stating the practices consider various types of audits is true, the hypothesis that there is only one type of audit cannot be true."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

News article: 2 Deputies Killed and 2 Hurt in Louisiana Shootings Two sheriff’s deputies in Louisiana were killed and two others were wounded in separate but related shootings on Thursday morning in what the authorities described as an “ambush” in a rural town northwest of New Orleans. Many details remain unclear about the shootings, which occurred about 5:30 a.m. in an industrial section of LaPlace, in Saint John the Baptist Parish, Sheriff Mike Tregre said at a news conference. “I lost two good officers today,” Sheriff Tregre said as he fought back tears. “Please pray for the officers who were ambushed.” Sheriff Tregre said the events unfolded as two of his deputies working a traffic detail in an oil refinery parking lot were shot by someone inside a car they had stopped. The reason for the stop was not immediately known, but deputies were able to arrest the gunman, the sheriff said. Moments later, Sheriff Tregre said, the authorities received an emergency call about a speeding car that had just left the refinery lot and had gone to a nearby trailer park. When deputies located the car outside a trailer, they were greeted at the door by a man with a dog, but were able to see inside, where they saw a man who appeared to be hiding, fully clothed, under a blanket, Sheriff Tregre said. Within seconds, the deputies found themselves being shot at by a man with an assault rifle, according to the sheriff. “For some unknown reason, a gunman opened fire,” said Sheriff Tregre, who has been in office for only 45 days. The deceased officers were identified as Brandon Nielson, 34, and Jeremy Triche, 28. The two wounded deputies are in surgery with multiple gunshot wounds.

In a press conference held earlier today, Facebook announced the launch of its brand-new location features designed to allow users to interact with their surroundings more dynamically than ever before. Mark Zuckerberg himself provided a comprehensive walkthrough of the latest additions, giving the audience an exclusive inside look at what's in store for the millions of Facebook users worldwide. The Location Features Revolution: The primary focus of Facebook's new location features is to bring innovative ways for users to share their real-world experiences with their online friends and community. The latest update contains three core elements: Interactive Maps, Live Location Tracking, and Community Collaboration, making it easier than ever before to see what's happening around the world at any given moment. 1. Interactive Maps: Interactive Maps offers users a visual representation of their surroundings, allowing them to access information about local businesses, events, attractions, and other points of interest. This feature is more than just a map, however; it's designed as a social platform where users can see what their friends are recommending, check into locations, leave reviews, and even partake in discussions or ask questions about a specific place. Facebook's integration of the Interactive Maps will grant users the ability to customize their personal maps based on their preferences, whether it's a map focused on nearby restaurants, museums, or parks. Users can create and save multiple maps for different purposes or share them with friends for collaborative planning and exploration. 2. Live Location Tracking: The Live Location Tracking is Facebook's answer to the increasing demand for real-time location sharing across different applications. This feature allows users to share their current location with friends or a specific group of people for a set period. It's an excellent tool for coordinating meet-ups, ensuring everyone's safety during events, or just keeping in touch with loved ones. Users can choose who has access to their Live Location, ensuring that their privacy is maintained while still enjoying the convenience of real-time location sharing. The feature also works seamlessly across devices – one can share their Live Location from their mobile device and others can view it on desktop computers, tablets, or any platform where Facebook is accessible. 3. Community Collaboration: Facebook's Community Collaboration takes social engagement to new heights, paving the way for users to contribute to the local community by sharing recommendations, reviews, or even reporting neighborhood problems. This feature encourages users to become responsible citizens and foster a more sustainable living environment. Elements of Community Collaboration include the ability to explore neighborhood-focused groups, report and discuss local issues, and even collaborate on crowdfunding projects for community improvement. By fostering a collective sense of responsibility, Facebook's new location features bring communities closer together and create a more connected world. In Conclusion: The introduction of Facebook's new location features is a gamechanger in the world of social media, allowing users to immerse themselves in their environment and integrate online interactions with real-life experiences. As millions of users eagerly await the live roll-out of these features, it's clear that Facebook is leading the charge in revolutionizing the future of digital engagement. So, what are you waiting for? Fire up your Facebook account, dive into the new location features, and explore the world around you with the support and companionship of your virtual community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grind the pigment until you do not feel any \\"grittiness\\" as you apply pressure. Most pigments will break down fairly easily, so just make sure that there are no irregular lumps remaining.  If the pigment has come in powdered form, you may not need to grind it unless it is lumpy. Before you begin mixing the components together, you should measure and record the quantity of pigment and base used. You may need to make more of a color before you finish a painting or to retouch a painting. You can only do so with consistency if you know how much pigment and acrylic base you used. Acrylic base is essentially paint without pigment. It will usually come in a squeezable tube and the substance itself will appear white. There are several different sorts, such as glossy or matte, and you must determine which type you need for your painting. Use the wooden chopstick to mix them thoroughly together, until the pigment is evenly dispersed throughout the acrylic base. Read the instructions that came with your acrylic binder because the preferred ratio of base to solution varies from brand to brand.  Some pigments (especially organic ones) have a tendency to float on water. In this case you would substitute alcohol. Make sure you are using a solution appropriate for the pigment.  It’s not ideal to mix alcohol into acrylic paints because alcohol dries quickly, causing the paint to also dry quickly. If you are using a pigment that mixes best with alcohol but want the paint to dry more slowly, you can add water after you have mixed the pigment with alcohol. Too much water or alcohol will dilute the acrylic binder, so be careful. Acrylic retarder helps to slow how quickly acrylic paint dries. It’s important to follow the instructions that came with your acrylic retarder. However, a general rule of thumb is that more retarder used, the slower the acrylic paint will dry. You can figure out ratios of your own liking as you become accustomed to its use. Acrylic retarders are especially necessary if you are attempting to create photorealistic paintings or portraits of a human subject. Colors must be blended together on the canvas to create the contours of complex shapes, but fast-drying acrylics will set before a second color can be added. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to create customized acrylic paints by mixing dry pigments with an acrylic base. It emphasizes the importance of measuring and recording the pigment to base ratios, choosing the appropriate solution (water or alcohol) for the pigment, and using an acrylic retarder to control the drying time of the paint. The article also explains various tools required for the process, such as a plastic mixing container, wooden chopstick, painting spatula, and offers tips on grinding pigments and achieving the desired consistency and finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who told him about the murder at the property? Choose your answer from: (I). Real estate agent; (II).

As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal. Moss, an apt criminology student, forms a plan to \\"get inside the head\\" of Gacy, hoping to uncover new information regarding Gacy's murders and write a standout term paper on Gacy in the process.He sends Gacy his first letter, and is at first untruthful, telling him he has no girlfriend and a bad relationship with his supposedly controlling and abusive parents. He also states that his little brother, who is being bullied at school, sees him as a hero and would do anything for him. Gacy's first response is to send a questionnaire regarding Moss's personal and sex life. Moss, seeing an interview in which Gacy admits to engaging in sodomy, adopts a different tact. He begins working out, taking pictures of himself posing topless, and portraying himself as increasingly vulnerable and lonely in his letters. He informs Gacy that he has considered hustling or nude dancing in order to earn extra money. Gacy, beginning to open up, acts understanding and supportive in his letters, encouraging Moss to take up hustling and even giving him advice on technique and safety precautions, asking Moss to \\"tell me all about it... don't hold back.\\"Moss, not wanting to lose the connection he has made with Gacy, but unwilling to go quite so...

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995–96 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995–96 Atlanta Hawks season.  Playing Power forward (basketball), he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award.

Write a summary based on this article: President Obama on Wednesday delivered a sharply personal rebuke of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz Ted CruzMichele Bachmann: God picked Trump to be the GOP nominee Trump at immigration crossroads Poll: Majority of GOP voters wish they chose another presidential nominee MORE for his call to institute surveillance on Muslim communities in response to the Brussels terrorist attacks.      During a press conference in Argentina, Obama called such a proposal “wrong and un-American” and said it would undermine the U.S. campaign against Islamic extremists.      ADVERTISEMENT      Obama invoked Cruz’s Cuban heritage, arguing the Texas senator was ignoring the personal journey of his father, who fled the island nation for the United States to escape political oppression.      “I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America,” the president said. “The land of the free. The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense.”      It was the second day in a row Obama addressed the series of blasts in the Belgian capital that killed at least 31 people and injured more than 180, including a dozen Americans.      The Brussels attacks shook up the presidential campaign with fresh concerns about the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.      Some Republican candidates have called for drastic measures to prevent a similar strike in the U.S.      Cruz said Muslim neighborhoods should be put under special watch by authorities in order to preempt any future attacks in the U.S.      GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald Trump5 things to watch for in Trump's immigration speech Deportations under Obama could hit 10-year low Trump softens rhetoric in pitch to black voters MORE backed Cruz on the patrols and renewed his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and for waterboarding to be used on terrorism suspects.      The proposals touched off a fierce political debate, with Democrats accusing Trump and Cruz of encouraging Islamophobia to win over conservative votes.      Candidates on both sides of the aisle called for tougher security measures in the U.S. and demanded Obama take a more aggressive approach to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which claimed responsibility for the attacks.      But Obama indicated he would not make significant changes to his anti-ISIS strategy \\"simply because it's political season.\\"      The president said defeating the group is his “No. 1 priority,” but it must be done in a “smart” way.      “As our strategy evolves and we see additional opportunities, we will go after it,” Obama said.      But he said the U.S. should not “take approaches that will be counterproductive,\\" such as carpet-bombing Middle Eastern countries, an idea Cruz proposed.      “Not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more,\\" Obama said, using an alternate acronym for the group. “That’s not a smart strategy.”      The president pledged he would \\"continue to go after ISIL aggressively until it is removed from Syria and removed from Iraq and is finally destroyed.\\"      The U.S. has relied on airstrikes to fight the extremist group and has mostly turned to local forces on the ground, resisting calls for a large-scale ground campaign.      American special operations forces have carried out strikes against certain ISIS targets, and the Marines recently set up a base in northern Iraq with around 200 troops. One Marine was killed in an ISIS rocket attack there last Saturday.      At the same time, Obama reiterated his belief that the group does not pose \\"an existential threat\\" to the U.S. and said that its activities should not disrupt the daily lives of Americans.      \\"Even as we are systematic and ruthless and focused in going after them ... it is very important for us to not respond with fear,\\" the president said. \\"We defeat them in part by saying, 'You are not strong. You are weak.' \\" ||||| REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado US President Barack Obama called out Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate and Texas senator, for suggesting amped-up surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods in the US as a way to prevent terrorist attacks.      Obama's remarks came Wednesday in a press conference during a visit to Argentina, a day after terrorists hit Belgium, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 230 in bombings at a Brussels airport and metro station.      The president emphasized that fighting the terrorist group ISIS — aka the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh — is his \\"top priority.\\"      But he criticized Cruz for proposing what he termed a \\"counterproductive\\" strategy that might isolate American Muslims.      Cruz said in a Tuesday statement that the police should be empowered to \\"patrol and secure\\" neighborhoods with large Muslim populations \\"before they become radicalized.\\"      \\"I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America, the land of the free,\\" Obama said, referencing a historic visit to Cuba earlier in the week.      He added: \\"The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense. It's contrary to who we are, and it's not going to help us to defeat ISIL.\\"      Obama's visit to Cuba marked the first time in 88 years that a sitting US president traveled to the communist country. Cruz's father fled Cuba for the US in 1957.      The president also criticized Cruz for saying that the US should \\"carpet bomb\\" ISIS in Iraq and Syria, a strategy that military experts have called ineffective and possibly illegal.      \\"When I hear somebody saying we should 'carpet bomb' Iraq or Syria, not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more people willing to die and explode bombs in an airport or in a metro station,\\" Obama said. \\"That's not a smart strategy.\\"      Obama noted that what sets the US apart from Europe, which sees higher rates of foreign fighters traveling to join terrorist groups, is that Muslims are better integrated into American society.      He said:      One of the great strengths of the United States, and part of the reason why we have not seen more attacks in the United States, is we have an extraordinarily successful, patriotic, integrated Muslim-American community. They do not feel ghettoized, they do not feel isolated. Their children are our children's friends, going to the same schools. They are our colleagues in our workplaces. They are our men and women in uniform, fighting for our freedom.      And so any approach that would single them out or target them for discrimination is not only wrong and un-American, but it also would be counterproductive. Because it would reduce the strength, the antibodies that we have to resist terrorism.      President Obama answering questions during a joint news conference with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. AP Photo/Victor R. Caivano      Obama also defended the US strategy for defeating ISIS, saying that the US's approach has been \\"continuously to adjust to see what works and what doesn't.\\"      \\"What has been working is the air strikes that we're taking on their leadership, on their infrastructure, on their financial systems,\\" he said.      \\"What has been working is special operators partnering with Iraqi security forces and going after leadership networks and couriers and disrupting the connection between their bases in Raqqa and their bases in Mosul,\\" he continued.      But he acknowledged the challenges of identifying threats in Western countries.      \\"It's challenging to find, identify very small groups of people who are willing to die themselves and can walk into a crowd and detonate a bomb,\\" Obama said.      He continued: \\"And my charge to my team is to find every strategy possible to successfully reduce the risk of such terrorist attacks even after we go after their beating heart in places like Iraq and Syria.\\" ||||| President Obama joined the growing chorus Wednesday condemning Sen. Ted Cruz for calling on cops to \\"patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\\" in the wake of the Belgian terror attacks.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 00:08 EST, 8 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 00:08 EST, 8 June 2012. Though most of Congress is likely looking forward to the summer recess, the Federal Reserve chairman offered a grim warning as the Bush-era tax cut expiration date looms. ‘If you all go on vacation,’ Ben Bernanke said, ‘(Taxmaggedon is) still going to happen, so it’s important to be thinking about that and working with your colleagues to see how you might address that concern at the appropriate time.’ He spoke urgently of the Bush-era tax cuts that will cost taxpayers 130billion in increases if nothing is done to extend them. Grim warning: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Congress Thursday to make a decision on the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire. Arms crossed: Bernanke is pictured before testifying at a Joint Economic Committee hearing on economic outlook and policy on Capitol Hill in Washington. Speaking at the Joint Economic Committee, Bernanke painted a grim warning. ‘If allowed to occur…(it would) pose a significant threat to the recovery,’ he said. ‘If no action were taken and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size, I think it would be very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even into recession.’ He also added that unemployment would again rise from its current high at 8.2 per cent. However, he said the Fed is prepared to take steps to boost the U.S. economy if it weakens. But he said Fed officials still need to study the most recent economic trends, including job growth. For now, Bernanke said he foresees moderate growth this year. He said he's mindful that all that could change, if Europe's crisis quickly worsened or U.S. job growth stalled. 'As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate,' he told the Joint Economic Committee. The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, which might encourage more borrowing and spending. Or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014 until an even later date. Don't let it happen: He said that the tax cuts cannot expire, as more unemployment and even another recession could result. But most economists don't expect a major announcement at the Fed's next policy meeting June 19-20, despite signals this week from some other Fed members in favour of considering further action. For one thing, long-term U.S. interest rates have already touched record lows. Even if rates dropped further, analysts say they might provide little benefit for the economy. ‘If allowed to occur (Taxmaggedon) would pose a. significant threat to the recovery. If no action were taken. and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size, I think it would be. very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even. into recession.' They say it's unlikely that many businesses and consumers who aren't borrowing now at super-low rates would do so if rates declined a bit more. And Bernanke could face pressure not to pursue further stimulus before the November election because such steps could be perceived as helping President Barack Obama win re-election. 'The Fed simulative effects have really run their course,' Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, argued in a television interview last week. John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, said there was nothing in the testimony to 'tip Bernanke's hand' before the June meeting of the Fed's policy committee. 'Yes, the Fed chairman said the Fed stands ready to act if Europe poses a threat to the U.S. financial system or the economy,' they wrote in a note to clients. 'However, he gave no specifics.' An early rally on Wall Street faded after Bernanke signalled no immediate further steps from the Fed to help the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average had been up as much as 140 points. It closed up about 46 points, or 0.3 per cent. Presiding: Bernanke presides over a meeting of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, from second left to right, Federal Reserve Board of Governors: Janet Yellen; Elizabeth Duke; Daniel Tarullo; Sarah Raskin; Jeremy Stein; Jerome Powell. Many analysts are worried that the U.S. economy is suffering a midyear slump just as in 2010 and 2011. They're concerned in particular about the job market. From December through February, the economy added an average 252,000 jobs a month. But since then, job growth has slowed to a lacklustre 96,000 a month. In May, U.S. employers added just 69,000 jobs - the fewest in a year. Bernanke said the Fed is still assessing the most recent employment data. Like many economists, Bernanke suggested that a warm winter might have prompted some hiring that normally would have occurred later. That could have weakened hiring temporarily in the spring. If that's true, hiring might bounce back. Still, Bernanke said some of the winter hiring might have made up for excessive job cuts during the recession. If so, and if those companies have completed such 'catch-up' hiring, then stronger economic growth might be needed to boost hiring, Bernanke said. 'That is the essential question we will have to look at,' he told the panel. The government said last week that the economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the first three months of 2012. Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said he thought Bernanke didn't seem alarmed by the weak hiring in May. 'His view is that it isn't a sign that the economy is falling apart,' Edelstein said. Options: The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014. Bernanke's message to financial markets, Edelstein said, was, 'Don't expect anything drastic from the Fed at the June meeting.' That said, if the Fed does announce some new action at its meeting later this month, Edelstein said the most likely step would be to extend a program, known as Operation Twist, that will expire at the end of June. Under Operation Twist, the Fed sells shorter-term securities and buys longer-term bonds. As with other Fed bond purchases, the idea has been to drive down long-term rates so that mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business loans become more attractive. The Fed's policy committee has been split between those who favor doing everything possible to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment, and those more concerned about inflation risks. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the vice chairman of the Fed, Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta regional Fed Bank, and John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed bank, all suggested that the Fed might need to do more to provide support. But Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, warned at Thursday's hearing against more bond buying. He and other critics worry that ever-lower borrowing rates could eventually ignite inflation. 'It is my belief that the Fed has done all that it can do and has perhaps done too much,' said Brady, vice chairman of the committee. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Second question: Does GPA matter for an entry level software position at a great company? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First Question: Does GPA matter for a CS student who wants to work at a tech company? GPA, or Grade Point Average, is a measure of a student's academic performance. It can be an important factor for a Computer Science student who wants to work at a tech company, but it is not the only consideration. There are several aspects to consider on the subject. While a high GPA is generally regarded as an indication of a student's proficiency in their field of study, tech companies often look for more than just good grades when evaluating potential employees. They also consider the technical and soft skills, project experience, internships, and extra-curricular activities that shape a well-rounded candidate. Having a good GPA can give you an edge in securing interviews, especially with large and reputable tech companies, as they tend to employ strict filters when examining the plethora of applications received. However, smaller and more flexible companies might be more inclined to look past the numbers and focus on a candidate's skills and potential instead. In addition to GPA, companies like to see that a candidate has practical experience working on real-world projects, either independently or as part of a team. This experience can come from internships, freelance work, or personal projects that demonstrate your proficiency in particular programming languages or tools. Soft skills are also crucial, as they play a significant role in teamwork, problem-solving, and communication. Moreover, participating in hackathons, coding competitions, and open-source projects can help showcase your expertise and dedication outside the classroom. In summary, although GPA can be an important factor when applying for a job at a tech company, it is not the sole determinant. Technical and soft skills, project experience, internships, and extra-curricular activities are just as important in presenting yourself as a desirable candidate. Second Question: Does GPA matter for an entry-level software position at a great company? When pursuing an entry-level software position at a well-regarded company, having a good GPA can be beneficial, but it is not the only consideration. Companies generally look at a combination of factors and qualities that contribute to the candidate’s overall suitability for the role. As in the previous response, factors such as technical and soft skills, project experience, internships, and extra-curricular activities play crucial roles in hiring decisions. Larger and prestigious companies often have GPA cut-offs to manage the volume of applications they receive. In this case, having a good GPA can help to secure an interview or get your foot in the door. However, it is essential not to solely rely on your GPA – working on your other skills and experiences can make a significant difference in your job prospects. Smaller companies or start-ups are more likely to value hands-on experience, adaptability, and technical know-how over a high GPA. Demonstrating project management, collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills through internships, freelance work, personal projects, or open-source contributions can help you stand out in the eyes of potential employers. Comparing the two questions: While these two questions have subtle differences in context and focus, they are, in essence, asking the same thing: How important is GPA when seeking a position within the technology sector? Both questions emphasize the desire to work either at a tech company or in an entry-level software role at a reputable company. In both cases, the answer remains that GPA holds a certain degree of importance, but it is not the sole factor affecting hiring decisions. Technical and soft skills, hands-on experience, internships, and extra-curricular participation are equally crucial in presenting yourself as a strong candidate. It is essential to strike a balance between academic performance and practical experience, ensuring you gain the competencies that employers are looking for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This development comes after weeks of escalating tensions and violent confrontations in the area. Step 1: Establish the context The announcement of the cease-fire brings a temporary halt to the exchange of gunfire between Palestinian militants and Israeli soldiers that has terrorized the town's residents for several weeks. Numerous casualties have been reported on both sides amid growing concerns of a further escalation of the conflict. Step 2: Describe the cease-fire agreement The cease-fire agreement, facilitated by international mediators, outlines a framework wherein both sides agree to halt their hostility and refrain from any offensive action. In return, Palestinian authorities promise to prevent militants' attacks on Israel, while Israel agrees to halt its military operations around the town. Step 3: Highlight the significance of the agreement The Beit Jalla cease-fire marks a critical milestone in the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The negotiation process signals a willingness from both parties to engage in a peaceful resolution despite the immense challenges they have faced thus far. This agreement is an essential first step towards establishing a longer-lasting peace in the region. Step 4: Discuss potential challenges While the cease-fire brings much-needed respite for the residents of Beit Jalla, upholding the agreement depends on both sides' commitment to maintain the terms put forth. Possible obstacles include rogue militants who might not abide by the cease-fire and the risk of either party retaliating if provoked. Step 5: Conclude Despite potential challenges, the confirmation of the Beit Jalla cease-fire agreement by Shimon Peres offers a glimmer of hope in the conflict-ridden region. It is crucial for both Israelis and Palestinians to work together and adhere to the agreement terms to pave the way towards a sustainable peace in this volatile area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been... Question: Who took over the country in 1959? Options: - Miguel Diaz-Canel   - Fidel and Raul Castro   - The Soviet Union   - not enough information === The correct answer is The answer is:","output":"- Fidel and Raul Castro The justification for this is present in the text: \\"Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959...\\" This statement directly informs us that Fidel and Raul Castro took over the country in 1959."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Whether you were the shy one at high school or the most popular person on campus, starting university is a clean paper for everyone. It's the best time to develop your skills with different people, such as teachers, classmates, and roommates. Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation. You can also take out your earphones when someone asks to share a table with you in the common room while you're studying. Try to get along with roommates Getting along with roommates is a challenge you'd be wise to overcome. You live together, so you will often spend time together without even trying to. It's important to make sure that dorm life doesn't make you unhappy. You should be cautious about facing your roommates over any problems, especially if you have only just met. Remember, be polite but firm. The key is to set expectations and clear boundaries from the beginning. Let your roommates know your life habits, but also observe and respect...

Question: Which breed of dog, the Whippet or the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne, originated in England and descended from greyhounds? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Research the origins and breed history of the Whippet. Step 2: Research the origins and breed history of the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne. Step 3: Compare the information gathered in steps 1 and 2 to determine which breed originated in England and descended from greyhounds. Step 1: Researching the Whippet Whippets are medium-sized dogs known for their speed and agility. According to various sources, the Whippet originated in England and is a descendant of the Greyhound, bred for racing and hunting in the 18th and 19th centuries. Step 2: Researching the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne is a medium-sized, rough-coated dog native to France. According to numerous sources, this breed originated in the region of Brittany, France, and was bred for hunting purposes. Though they may share some resemblance to other dog breeds, they are not known to be descendants of greyhounds. Step 3: Comparing the information Based on the research gathered in the previous steps, it is clear that the Whippet is the breed that originated in England and descended from greyhounds, while the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne has its roots in France and is not a greyhound descendant.

Given the fact \\"an animal needs to eat food for nutrients\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Which of these things will supplement a squirrel's caloric needs?\\" Select from the following. I. fish; II. tree bark; III. nuts; IV. leaves;","output":"A squirrel's diet typically consists of a variety of plants, including nuts, seeds, conifer cones, fruits, fungi, and green vegetation. However, squirrels are versatile animals, and their diet varies significantly depending on their environment.  I. Fish - While it's not impossible for a squirrel to eat fish, particularly if nothing else is available, it's highly unlikely. Squirrels are not effective predators of mobile, aware prey like fish. Additionally, their digestive systems are not designed to process meat effectively. The way a squirrel's teeth are designed makes it difficult for them to consume and digest meat or fish.  II. Tree Bark - Squirrels are known to strip tree bark, particularly in the winter when other food sources are scarce. Certain tree bark can be a source of nutrition, but a squirrel cannot survive on bark alone. Plus, eating too much bark can be damaging to a squirrel's teeth. III. Nuts - This is the primary and favorite food source for many squirrels. They have a particular liking for walnuts, hickory nuts, and acorns. Nuts are a rich source of proteins, vitamins, essential oils, and help in the growth and development of squirrels. Almonds and hazelnuts are rich in protein and fat and help the squirrel to maintain its body temperate in the harsh winter season. That extra fat layer is vital to their survival during the colder months when food is scarce. Nuts are also efficient calorie sources for squirrels, as they are both energy-dense and readily available in many environments where squirrels live. IV. Leaves - Leaves offer little in the way of nutrition or caloric content for most herbivores, including squirrels. However, some squirrels would consume leaves, primarily if other food options are scarce. They would be a far less efficient food source than nuts or seeds, though. So among the options given, nuts (III) are the most suitable to supplement a squirrel's caloric needs. Nuts provide the high-energy, nutrient-dense food source that squirrels require for their active lifestyle. While tree bark (II) and leaves (IV) might occasionally be part of a squirrel's diet, they are not as nutritious or energy-dense as nuts. Fish (I), on the other hand, is not a typical part of a squirrel's diet and wouldn't likely provide the type of nutrients a squirrel needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic seems to be thinking negatively of the movie. Here are the steps to arrive at this conclusion: 1. The first part of the review describes \\"Linklater fans.\\" By specifying a particular group of fans, the critic implies that the movie may only appeal to a specific type of audience (in this case, fans of director Richard Linklater). This suggests that the movie may not have a broad appeal. 2. The phrase \\"pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde\\" is used to describe another group of people who may appreciate the movie. The words \\"pretentious\\" and \\"want to appear\\" have negative connotations, as they suggest that these individuals are merely trying to portray themselves as sophisticated or cultured without having genuine appreciation for the movie's artistic merit. 3. Finally, the use of the phrase \\"suck up to this project\\" implies that these groups of people, rather than genuinely enjoying the film, are merely pretending to do so in order to maintain their image or status.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: People tend to be more impressed by evidence that seems to confirm some relationship. Thus many are convinced that their dreams are prophetic because a few have come true; they  fail to notice the many that have not. Consider also the belief that \\"the phone always rings when I'm in the shower. \\" If it does ring while you are in the shower, the event will stand out and be remembered. If it doesn't ring, that nonevent probably won't even be remembered. People want to see order, pattern and meaning in the world. Consider, for example, the common belief that things like personal misfortunes, plane crashes, and deaths \\"happen in threes. \\" Such beliefs stem from the tendency of people to allow the third event to define the time period. I if three plane crashes occur in a month, then the period of time that counts as their \\"happening together\\" is one month; if three crashes occur in a year, the period of time is stretched. Flexible end strengthens such beliefs.  We also tend to believe what we want to believe. A majority of people think they are more intelligent, more fair-minded and more skilled behind the wheel of an automobile than the average person. Part of the reason we view ourselves so favorably is that we use standards that work to our advantage. As economist Thomas Schelling explains, \\"Everybody ranks himself high in qualities. \\" He values: careful drives give weight to care, skilled drivers give weight to skill, and those who are polite give weight to courtesy. \\" This way everyone ranks high on his own scale.

His dedication to the language learning program and commitment to practicing for at least two hours daily soon started to show results. He diligently followed the program and made it a point not to miss any sessions. Feeling motivated by his progress, he expanded his learning techniques even further. Realizing that immersion in the language was crucial for his success, Jordan started looking for opportunities to practice his Spanish outside of the online program. He researched local language institutes and found a nearby Spanish-speaking meetup group that he could join. At these meetups, Jordan met other Spanish learners as well as native speakers who were eager to share their language and culture with him. Together, they engaged in conversation, played games, and participated in activities related to the Spanish language. The more Jordan progressed with his studies, the stronger his desire to connect with Spanish-speaking individuals both offline and online grew. He ventured into Spanish forums and started watching movies and shows in the language with the purpose of improving his listening comprehension skills. At first, he watched with subtitles to make it easier to understand the content. As time passed and his skills improved, he eventually began watching without subtitles – a true testament to his enhanced language abilities. To complement his online program and come as close as possible to native-level fluency, Jordan even started reading books, newspapers, and magazines in Spanish. These resources helped expand his vocabulary and offered valuable insights into the culture of Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. As the months went by and his departure to Mexico approached, Jordan felt increasingly ready for the big move. He began looking for a place to live and researching the best options for work and necessities. Armed with newfound knowledge about the culture and a solid grasp of the language, he was able to secure a great job opportunity that aligned with his skills and interests.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"To answer both questions, let's break down each question individually and determine the similarities and differences in their meanings. Question 1: Is cheating ever acceptable? This question asks whether there are conditions or situations where cheating may be considered tolerable or permissible. Step 1: Define cheating in its broadest sense. Cheating is acting dishonestly or unfairly to gain an advantage. Step 2: Consider different contexts in which cheating could occur (academic, personal relationships, sports, etc.). Step 3: Analyze whether there may be instances where cheating, despite its negative connotation, could be deemed acceptable by some people or according to certain moral, ethical, or philosophical viewpoints. Question 2: Can you ever justify cheating? This question asks whether there are circumstances or reasons that can be used to defend or vindicate cheating. Step 1: Identify reasons or arguments one might make to justify cheating (e.g., survival, self-defense, greater good). Step 2: Consider if these reasons are morally or ethically valid under various moral and ethical frameworks. Step 3: Reflect on the potential consequences or risks of cheating in different situations, weighing the justification provided against the potential harm and overall outcome. Comparing the two questions, we can see that they are asking similar but slightly different things. The first question is focused on the acceptability of cheating, whereas the second question is focused on providing reasoning or justification for cheating.

Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless.  Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions.  Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Kaiser Chiefs are an English indie rock band from Leeds who formed in 2000 as Parva, releasing one studio album, 22, in 2003, before renaming and establishing themselves in their current name that same year. Since their formation the band consists of lead vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist Andrew \\"Whitey\\" White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist and occasional drummer Nick \\"Peanut\\" Baines and since 2013 drummer Vijay Mistry, who replaced founding drummer Nick Hodgson who left the band in late 2012. Primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, the band have released six original studio albums: Employment (2005), Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), Off with Their Heads (2008) When they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire. After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university. Parva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and left desolate and without any direction after the release of an album (22) and three singles (\\"Heavy\\", \\"Good Bad Right Wrong\\" and \\"Hessles\\").  According to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \\"No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them.\\" The band decided that they would aim for a longer term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe.  Manager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams and persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: \\"I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles.\\" Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band.  In July 2004, while still relatively unknown inside the UK, Kaiser Chiefs performed their first festival outside the UK at a festival in Moscow. One of the major factors in the band's breakthrough in 2005 was their involvement in the NME Awards Tour at the beginning of the year. Like Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand before them, their position as opening act proved an influential one, attracting a lot of positive media attention.  The group's debut album Employment was released in March 2005, being primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s. The album was well received by music critics, described as \\"thrilling from beginning to end\\" and \\"quintessentially British, without pretension and most importantly, a whole lot of fun\\". It reached number two on the UK albums chart, and was certified five times platinum. In 2005, Employment was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year. Bookmakers made it favourite to win the award, but they eventually lost out to Antony and the Johnsons. In 2006, Employment won the Ivor Novello award for 'Best Album'  The first single released from the album was \\"Oh My God\\" in 2004, which reached number six on the UK singles chart when it was reissued in February 2005. In 2007, the song was covered by Mark Ronson and Lily Allen for Ronson's album Version. \\"I Predict a Riot\\" soon followed as the album's second release. In 2007, the song was ranked number thirty-six on the NME \\"Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\\" countdown. The top twenty singles \\"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\\" and \\"Modern Way\\" followed in late 2005. The band opened and performed several of their singles at the Philadelphia Live Eight concert in 2005. The song \\"Saturday Night\\" was featured in a pre-release video for the Xbox 360 gaming console. It was posted on the official Xbox 360 page before its launch.  In 2006, the band received NME awards for 'Best Album' for Employment and 'Best Dressed' for Ricky Wilson.  On 4 August 2008, the band confirmed the name of their third album as Off with Their Heads. It was released on 20 October 2008. The first single \\"Never Miss a Beat\\" was released on 6 October 2008.  The band also released a DVD of their live performance at Elland Road from 24 May where they played to a sold out capacity crowd of 40,000 people. The DVD contains the full set from the home of Leeds United as well as highlights from the Kaiser Chiefs performance for the 2007 BBC Electric Proms.  Kaiser Chiefs set out on a UK tour in October 2008 with Castle Donington band Late of the Pier and The Hair. The tour started at Leeds Academy, a new venue where they were the first headlining band to play. Other dates included Manchester Academy, Southampton Guildhall, Reading Rivermead, Glasgow Barrowlands, Leicester De Montfort Hall and London Forum.  Kaiser Chiefs headed out on a UK Arena tour between February and March 2009, kicking off in Nottingham and ending in London. The tour visited Sheffield, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Dublin. This was the new album tour to promote Off with Their Heads. The band featured on several shows over Christmas 2008 including performing \\"Never Miss a Beat\\" with Girls Aloud on their TV Special and playing the same song on the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops.  On 16 July 2009, they played at Mares Vivas in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal as headliners on that day. They, along with Republic of Loose, opened for U2 in Croke Park in Dublin on 25 July 2009. They then opened for Green Day from 27 July to 7 August 2009, and the final shows before their 2-year hiatus were performed at Reading and Leeds Festival 2009. Did they perform anywhere else in Europe?","output":"Yes, the Kaiser Chiefs have performed in many places across Europe throughout their career.

With PS6, I went to the supermarket, picked up some food and started to cook at home. It was time for me to make a change and get back on my feet. I began to write a series of articles for the website named Hunger Hurt in July 2011. A few months later, local food bank gave me some help-- with some free vegetables every month, which made my life a little easier. I began to write recipes , posting them on my blog.

Based on the premise \\"While it would be a crime to ignore the churches, palazzos, and museums chronicling the unparalleled glories of Italy's history, the best way to enjoy them is also to spend plenty of time soaking it in from a front-row seat in a cafe, or from under a canvas beach umbrella watching seaside life unfold.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Taking in the sights by observing the locals will tell you what Italy is really like.\\" is true?","output":"Yes, one possible interpretation of the premise provided could lead to the conclusion that \\"Taking in the sights by observing the locals will tell you what Italy is really like.\\" is true. However, let's discuss this in greater detail to fully understand how we can arrive at this conclusion. The premise opens with the acknowledgment of Italy's rich historical heritage, mentioning aspects such as the church, palazzos, and museums that create a compelling portrayal of the country's past. This part suggests that visiting these places, absorbing the history, art, and culture they represent, is crucial to understanding Italy. And while ignoring these would be considered a \\"crime,\\" it does not mean that it is the only way to learn about Italy. On the contrary, the premise suggests that a complementary - if not equally important – method of experiencing the Italian cultural landscape is embodied in spending time amid the daily life of its citizens. This is where the recommendations of spending time in cafes and watching life unfold on the beach come in. These settings are often less formal and more relaxed, allowing tourists to absorb the Italian way of life in a much more personal and close-to-life manner.  Soaking in the atmosphere, listening to the hum of Italian conversations, watching the everyday interactions between people - all this provides insight into the local mindset, traditions, and social norms. From these observations, one can glean the nuances of the Italian lifestyle, which museums and monuments might not wholly capture. The character, rhythm, and pulse of a city are reflected not only in its static monuments but also in its dynamic citizens, whose daily life paint a vivid representation of what the place is \\"really like\\". Therefore, observing locals and partaking in everyday Italian activities isn't just a useful supplement to visiting historical sites; it's a crucial part of indulging in and understanding the nation's unique identity. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"taking in the sights by observing the locals will tell you what Italy is really like\\" can be seen as a valid extension of the given premise. It indicates that there is a live, vibrant, and evolving side of Italy living concurrently with its historical persona, best understood by becoming part of it, even if temporarily. Enjoying Italy is not just about appreciating the glories of its past, but also embracing the appeal of its present, as revealed in the theatres of its cafes and beaches."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Acest proces este influențat de diferiți factori, cum ar fi atenția noastră, emoțiile, experiențele anterioare și importanța informațiilor. Dacă o anumită imagine sau un anumit mesaj ne impresionează profund, suntem predispuși să le reținem mai ușor pentru a le utiliza ulterior în diverse circumstanțe. Imaginile și mesajele impresionante sunt, de obicei, încărcate cu emoții puternice - precum fericire, tristețe sau furie - și pot conține un element surprinzător sau neobișnuit, care atrage și menține atenția noastră. Spre exemplu, o reclama care prezintă un peisaj uluitor sau o situație de viață în care se transmite un mesaj emoționant, ne poate rămâne în minte mult timp după ce am văzut-o.

Graeme Obree (born 11 September 1965), nicknamed The Flying Scotsman, is a Scottish racing cyclist who twice broke the world hour record, in July 1993 and April 1994, and was the individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire but has lived almost all his life in Scotland and considers himself Scottish. An individual time triallist, his first race was a 10-mile time trial to which he turned up wearing shorts, anorak and Doc Marten boots. He thought the start and finish were at the same place and stopped where he had started, 100 metres short of the end. He had started to change his clothes when officials told him to continue. He still finished in \\"about 30 minutes.\\"  Obree suffers from bipolar disorder. He attempted suicide in his teens by gassing himself. He was saved by his father, who had returned early from work. In the 1990s he took an overdose of aspirin washed down by water from a puddle.

In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt.

Answer:","output":"The crew gets footage for the film Tropic Thunder by employing standard filmmaking techniques, such as using multiple cameras, lights, and staging scenes with actors and extras. The film is primarily shot on location in jungle settings, which helps create authenticity and realism. The director, Damien Cockburn, guides the actors through their scenes, while working with a crew of cinematographers, sound technicians, and other specialists to capture the necessary footage.  Additionally, the movie incorporates mock trailers and commercials within its narrative, which are filmed and edited in the style of real advertisements and movie trailers to enhance the satire and spoof elements of the film. Tropic Thunder is a metatextual comedy, which means that it not only portrays the storyline of the actors' misadventures in the wilderness, but also pokes fun at the Hollywood filmmaking process.

Given the question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province.

Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed.

However, if you find yourself looking up old recipes on the internet, follow it..  * For instance, strawberry shortcake cream bread, scones, and popcorn squares are most commonly made with white bread. Use this to create the classic fairy bread mix..  * You can cut off the crusts, or leave them on, according to your preference. If you are making fairy bread for kids, consider taking off the crust..  * If you want a rounded loaf, try repeating the bread recipe over and over again to achieve a round loaf. Oatmeal is also added to the bulk of your bread..","output":"Instead of white bread, you can try using whole wheat bread for a healthier alternative. Although it may not be as traditional as white bread, whole wheat bread offers more nutritional value and can be a good choice if you want to add a twist to the classic fairy bread recipe. If you'd like to maintain the authenticity of the original recipe, feel free to try other options like strawberry shortcake cream bread, scones, and popcorn squares, which are commonly made with white bread. Be sure to pick your bread based on your taste preference and the type of event you are making the fairy bread for. When preparing the fairy bread, decide whether you want to leave the crust on or not. For children's parties or picky eaters, removing the crust may be beneficial. However, if you prefer a more rustic touch and added texture, feel free to keep the crust on. This choice is down to your personal preference and the preferences of your guests. Now, if you'd like to experiment with the shape of your loaf, you can try repeating the bread recipe over and over again to achieve a round loaf. Adding oatmeal to the bulk of your bread can also yield an unique texture and give a different spin to your fairy bread recipe. After selecting and preparing the bread of your choice, follow these simple steps to make the perfect fairy bread: 1. Soften butter: Let some butter reach room temperature so that it’s easily spreadable. This will prevent the bread from tearing during the spreading process. 2. Spread butter: Generously spread the softened butter on one side of each slice of bread. Make sure to cover the entire surface, as the butter acts as a glue for the sprinkles. 3. Add sprinkles: Pour rainbow-colored sprinkles or nonpareils onto a plate. Gently press the buttered side of the bread into the sprinkles, making sure that they stick evenly and completely cover the surface. You may also opt for different colored sprinkles, depending on the theme of your event or to match personal preferences. 4. Cut into shapes: Using a knife or cookie cutters, cut the fairy bread into triangles, squares, rectangles, or fun shapes like hearts and stars. Smaller, bite-sized shapes work best for parties and easy snacking. 5. Arrange and serve: Place the fairy bread pieces on a serving platter or tray, creating a colorful and enticing display. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for a short period to maintain freshness. Enjoy your homemade fairy bread, a delightful and whimsical treat that is sure to bring smiles to everyone's faces, regardless of age!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A woman urinates on the grass by the side of the road. She then pulls up her underwear and enters the nearby car, where her husband is waiting for her. Then they drive away. The couple have lost their way in the night, and subsequently run off the side of the road. The next scene occurs in daytime, and depicts their corpses. The man has lost an eyeball, but remains inside the vehicle. While the woman was thrown off the vehicle, and her body was cut in two pieces.[4] The film centers on Rob Schmadtke, the tragic hero, who works for \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\", a company that removes bodies from public areas. They clean up the mess after traffic collisions. Their emblem is the Totenkopf symbol (skull and crossbones variant) within a pentagram.[4][5] This job leaves him the perfect opportunity to pursue his full-time hobby: necrophilia. He returns home from his job to his apartment and girlfriend, Betty. He plays with his assortment of preserved human remains and watches television while Betty takes a bath in blood-laden water. Their apartment is decorated with centerfolds featuring models, pictures of famed killers, and jars containing human parts, which are preserved in formaldehyde.[4] Rob watches a televised interview of a psychiatrist, speaking on the topic of arachnophobia and ways to overcome phobias. Rob then enters a daydream of a young lop rabbit being caught on a farm and graphically slaughtered. By implication, these are memories of his father killing \\"a beloved childhood pet\\". Followed by memories of a pathologist performing an autopsy on a human cadaver.[4] The following scene is seemingly unrelated. A man drinks beer and practices with his rifle at the same time, while listening to an oom-pah rhythm. The character would not seem out of place in a Heimatfilm. He accidentally kills a nearby gardener, and then discards the corpse.[4][5] Rob then returns to work and discovers his new obsession, a whole rotting corpse. The corpse of the unnamed gardener.[4] It is... Answer:","output":"Based on the provided movie plot, a suitable question to generate might be: How does Rob Schmadtke's traumatic childhood experiences and exposure to death and violence through his job at \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\" contribute to the development of his disturbing behavior and necrophilia, and what is the significance of the seemingly unrelated scene featuring a man accidentally killing a gardener in understanding Rob's character and the overall narrative of the film? In this question, we address several critical aspects of the film, including the protagonist's mental state, the influence of his past and job, and the potential symbolism in the seemingly unrelated character's actions. To answer this question, we can delve into the effects of Rob Schmadtke's childhood trauma and his work at the cleaning agency. The film establishes a connection between his fascination with death and his past, as evidenced by his daydream of a childhood pet being brutally killed - presumably a memory from his past, which implies that exposure to violence has been a part of Rob's life since he was young. This connection is further strengthened by the subsequent memory of witnessing a human autopsy, indicating that death fascinates Rob just as much as it traumatizes him. Similarly, Rob's job at \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\" exposes him to death and violence regularly, albeit with a different context. The fact that his job allows him to engage in his necrophilia hobby underscores how his work only serves to feed his twisted desires. This idea is reinforced by his home decorated with killer's memorabilia and human body parts, exhibiting the extent of his obsession with death. Regarding the seemingly unrelated scene involving a man accidentally killing a gardener, its significance could be twofold. Firstly, it might symbolize how seemingly normal individuals can also be capable of causing harm or engaging in violence – thus, drawing a parallel between Rob and this character. Additionally, it confirms the thematic preoccupation with death and violence in the movie. Secondly, since the gardener's corpse becomes Rob's new obsession, the scene acts as a catalyst for the film's primary conflict or turning point, directly impacting Rob's character development and the unfolding events. In conclusion, Rob Schmadtke's dark past, his job at the cleaning agency, and the film's rampant symbolic violence all contribute to his character's disturbing nature. Furthermore, the seemingly unrelated scene with the accidental killing of a gardener serves as both a thematic reinforcement and a direct influence on Rob's actions within the film's narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was the eldest of four children of William Mickle Paul I (1850-1902) and Tacie Paul (nee Parry), and a descendant of William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania. Her siblings were Willam, Helen, and Parry. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; her ancestors included participants in the New Jersey Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. Context: In the US presidential election of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent Democrats to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and picketing at the White House. The pickets, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign known as the \\"Silent Sentinels,\\" held banners demanding the right to vote.  After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of \\"obstructing traffic.\\" Over the next six months, many, including Alice, were convicted and incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail.  When the public heard the news of the first arrests some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The Boston Journal, for example, stated, \\"The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation.\\"  Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as \\"Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?\\". Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed. While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters. Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten. Even though they were protesting during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. Throughout this time, more protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail. Pardons were no longer offered. Question: what was her biggest accomplishment?. Whats the answer?","output":"Alice Paul's biggest accomplishment was her instrumental role in the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. As a suffragist, feminist, and women's rights activist, Paul dedicated her life to the fight for gender equality.  As the leader of the National Woman's Party (NWP) in the early 20th century, she played a crucial role in organizing and orchestrating protests and demonstrations that raised public awareness and garnered national attention for the suffrage movement. This included her decision to organize the Silent Sentinels, who picketed outside of the White House to demand voting rights for women and placed continuous pressure on President Woodrow Wilson to act. Alice Paul's persistence, courage, and creative tactics, despite being faced with arrests, imprisonment, and violence, directly contributed to the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment on August 18, 1920. This historic amendment not only recognized women's right to vote but also laid the groundwork for subsequent efforts to advance women's rights and gender equality in the United States. Alice Paul's lasting impact can be observed through her relentless activism on behalf of women and her role in one of the most significant milestones in the American women's rights movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where did the mascot of Notre Dame first appear? Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure. The answer is:","output":"The mascot of Notre Dame, the Notre Dame Leprechaun, first appeared in 1964.

Nader Shah dreamed of an empire which would stretch from the Indus to the Bosphorus. Therefore he raised an army of 200,000, which consisted largely of rebellious Central Asian tribesmen, and he planned to march towards Constantinople, but after he learned that the Ottoman ulema was preparing for a holy war against Persia, he turned eastward. He captured Kirkuk, Arbil and besieged Mosul on 14 September 1743. The siege lasted for 40 days. The Pasha of Mosul, Hajji Hossein Al Jalili, successfully defended Mosul and Nader Shah was forced to retreat. The offensive was halted due to revolts in Persia  over high taxes. Hostilities also spilled into Georgia, where Prince Givi Amilakhvari employed an Ottoman force in a futile attempt to undermine the Persian influence and dislodge Nader's Georgian allies, Princes Teimuraz and Erekle.

Review: I can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to Argento's. His work is far more imaginative and vicious--and a lot more fun. The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes--and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about--aren't interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really didn't care when it was revealed. The cinematography isn't memorable, and the much-praised 19th century Gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in. Several of the actors are quite good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students), but they're given very little to do. Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism, and lesbianism, but amazingly, they add very little spice or suspense.  If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.

And the answer is?","output":"The answer is: Pele is the goddess of volcanoes in Hawaiian mythology. Pele, also known as Pelehonuamea, is revered as the powerful and passionate goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes in the ancient Hawaiian religion. Pele is part of a large family of gods and goddesses, known as the Pele family, that play a significant role in Hawaiian spiritual practices and the forces of nature that are present in the islands. According to legend, Pele was born in the land of Kuaihelani, a far-off mythical land, and she traveled across the ocean with her sister Hi'iaka and brother Kamohoali'i, in search of a new home, eventually settling in Hawaii. Accounts of Pele's origin and relationships among her relatives vary, but she is prominent in Hawaiian folklore and is commonly known as Ka wahine 'ai honua (\\"the woman who devours the land\\") due to her volcanic eruptions and the destructive nature of her powers. Pele is said to reside in Halema'uma'u crater located at the summit of Kīlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes on Hawai'i Island. This particular volcano is one of five that make up the island of Hawai'i, also known as the Big Island, and is considered sacred by native Hawaiians due to its connection with Pele. Hawaiian chants and oral history contain numerous tales about Pele and her exploits, which often portray her as a fiery, passionate, and volatile figure. These tales often depict her as having a dynamic character that embodies many emotions, such as love, jealousy, anger, and grief. In addition to being the creator of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, Pele is also thought to be responsible for both the destructive aspects of volcanic eruptions and the regenerative aspects of volcanic activity, as new earth is created from her molten lava flows. Today, Pele continues to be an essential figure in Hawaiian culture and is respected by many native Hawaiians and residents of the islands. Her influence can be seen in various art forms, from hula dancing to traditional chants, which celebrate and honor the powerful goddess. In contemporary times, the name \\"Pele\\" is also given to unusual volcanic phenomena or physical manifestations such as Pele's hair, delicate strands of volcanic glass formed by lava fountains, and Pele's tears, small solidified droplets of lava. Thus, Pele is the goddess of volcanoes in Hawaiian mythology and plays a prominent role in the culture and spiritual practices of the Hawaiian people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anti-Flag are an American punk rock band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The band is well known for politically charged lyrics and activism, focusing on anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and various sociopolitical sentiments. The line-up includes singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In 1996, the band released their first album, Die For the Government, on New Red Archives. Andy Flag left the band in the summer of 1996 because of personal disputes between himself and Justin. For a brief time after Andy's departure in 1996, Sean Whelan of Pittsburgh band the Bad Genes filled in on bass. It was during this time that Sean was also playing in another band (57 Defective) with guitarist Chris Head, whom he introduced to the band.  In early 1997, Pittsburgh guitarist Chris Head began filling in on bass. In late 1997, Jamie Cock took over as the new bassist, moving Chris Head over to second guitar, which he preferred. The current line-up finalized in 1999 when Chris Barker, also known as Chris No. 2, replaced Jamie Cock on bass.  In 1998, the band released their second full-length release, Their System Doesn't Work For You. The album contained all nine Anti-Flag songs from the 1996 Anti-Flag/d.b.s. split album North America Sucks, as well as 10 new unreleased songs. The band decided to release the album independently, and Their System Doesn't Work For You became the debut release for the band's own A-F Records.  In 1999, Anti-Flag released the album A New Kind of Army on Go-Kart Records/A-F Records. The album addressed topics such as abortion, political corruption, racism, fascism, troubled youth, police brutality, and unity within the American youth. The cover art page unfolded into a poster featuring the phrase \\"Too smart to fight. Too smart to kill. Join now.

The 1992 Local Government Act, which was enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, was responsible for the reorganization of local government on that date. Under this legislation, extensive changes were made to the administrative structures within England and Wales. The 1992 Local Government Act established a new system of unitary authorities, which were designed to simplify and streamline local government by providing a single tier of local administration responsible for all local government functions within their areas. This replaced the previous two-tier system that had been in place, consisting of county councils and district councils. In the specific example mentioned in the statement, the city referenced became administratively independent from Hampshire County as a result of the reorganization under the 1992 Local Government Act. It was made into a unitary authority, meaning it assumed responsibility for all local government functions within its borders, which allowed it to have greater control over its own affairs. The 1992 Local Government Act aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local government, reduce bureaucracy, and provide a clearer line of accountability between local authorities and their constituents. The Act was a key component of the wider reform of the local government system in the United Kingdom during the 1990s, and its effects can still be observed today in the organizational structures of many local authorities in England and Wales."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the answer: The 1937 novel ‘The Road to Wigan Pier’ was written by which British author?","output":"The 1937 novel 'The Road to Wigan Pier' was written by the renowned British author George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, India. Orwell was a prolific writer and esteemed social and political commentator known for his sharp insights and powerful literary works. He authored several other notable books, including 'Animal Farm' and '1984,' both of which have become classics in the realm of political satire and dystopian fiction. 'The Road to Wigan Pier' is an insightful non-fiction account of Orwell's experience living among the working-class communities in the North of England for several weeks in the early 1930s during the Great Depression. The book is divided into two parts: the first part is a detailed examination of the social conditions and living standards of the coal miners and industrial workers in Lancashire and Yorkshire, while the second part is an extended essay reflecting on his own middle-class upbringing and the broader sociopolitical issues surrounding class distinctions, poverty, and the rise of socialism in Britain at the time. Orwell's observations on the appalling living conditions and labor exploitation faced by the working class, as well as their resilience in the face of adversity, provided a stark depiction of the harsh realities of life during this tumultuous period in British history. In addition, his candid and critical analysis of the socialist movement demonstrated his commitment to a broader and more inclusive approach to social reform. 'The Road to Wigan Pier' continues to be a seminal work that offers valuable insights into the economic and social dynamics of its time, as well as Orwell's extraordinary talent as a writer and advocate for social justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: QINGDAO--Water and power supplies have been _ in the East Chinese city of Qingdao, the site of an oil pipeline explosion on Friday, the local government said on Monday. Crude oil began leaking from the pipeline at 3:00 an Friday in Qingdao in Shandong province. The valves of the Huangdao oil warehouse were shut about 15 minutes later. The oil spill then flowed into the city's rainwater pipe network, which empties into Jiaozhou Bay. Explosions occurred at two locations around 10:30 am Friday when workers were clearing the spill. According to the local government, about 85 percent of public heating and 90 percent of the gas supply were also brought back to normal as of Monday. Residents who have been taken to the temporary settlements are receiving bottled water and bread. Many schools and kindergartens have reopened classes after Friday's oil pipeline explosion. No injures and deaths of students or teachers have been reported following the explosions at an underground pipeline operated by Sinopec. The school buildings of one middle school in the district were seriously damaged during the explosions. Education authorities have arranged psychological help for students and teaching staff. All other 18 schools and kindergartens in the district reopened classes on Monday. As of Monday noon, the death toll from the explosion had risen to 55, with 9 people still missing and 136 hospitalized. According to local police, 49 bodied have been identified so far, and 42 of them were male victims. As of Monday morning, the blood supply in Qingdao was enough for the injured after more than 950 people in the city donated more than 340,000 ml of blood in the wake of the incident. Question: We can learn from the passage that  _  . Options: A: everything was brought back to normal right after the explosion B: no measures were taken to help the suffering people out of trouble C: no more dead body was found after Monday noon D: all the 19 schools in the district were affected by the explosion The answer is:","output":"To find the correct answer among the given options, I will analyze the information in the article step-by-step and verify it with the options provided. 1. The article states that public heating, gas supply, and schools were brought back to normal after the incident. Therefore, option A (everything was brought back to normal right after the explosion) is not correct because it implies that everything was fixed immediately. 2. The passage mentions several measures taken to help suffering people, like providing bottled water, bread, temporary settlements, opening schools, and blood donations. So, option B (no measures were taken to help the suffering people out of trouble) is incorrect. 3. The article does not provide information about whether any more dead bodies were found after Monday noon. Thus, option C (no more dead body was found after Monday noon) cannot be confirmed. 4. The passage states that 18 schools and kindergartens out of 19 in the district reopened classes, and one middle school building was seriously damaged. This means that all 19 schools were affected in some way. Option D (all the 19 schools in the district were affected by the explosion) is correct. So, based on my analysis, the answer is D: all the 19 schools in the district were affected by the explosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: A 23-year-old black man named Sylville K. Smith was fatally shot by a black officer in Milwaukee on Saturday, Aug. 13. Here's what you need to know. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Violent unrest continued in Milwaukee late Sunday and early Monday morning, a second night of tension after a fatal police shooting over the weekend. While the unease did not reach levels seen a night earlier, when multiple buildings were set on fire, it still suggested that the simmering anger could linger for days in Wisconsin’s biggest city. In a sign of how officials were trying to manage the situation and considering further steps, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (D) on Monday said a 10 p.m. weekday curfew would be strictly enforced for teenagers. He also said that officials had spoken to the city attorney’s office to be prepared in case they decide a “more widespread curfew” is needed. “Parents, after 10 o’clock, your teenagers better be home, or in a place where they’re off the streets,” Barrett said at a news briefing. Speaking of the areas where demonstrations have occurred, he said: “This is not the place where you go to gawk. It is not the place you go to take pictures. It’s not the place you go to drive your car around right now.” Police said an 18-year-old man was shot Sunday night in the Sherman Park area, which has been the center of the demonstrations, and officers said they used an armored vehicle to get the teenager to the hospital. The 18-year-old was shot in the neck at 11 p.m., and was continuing to receive medical treatment Monday, police said. Milwaukee police also said that seven law enforcement officers were injured during the unease overnight Sunday and into Monday, and they said at least one officer was taken to the hospital for treatment. Four Milwaukee officers were injured, including two of whom had glass fragments in their eyes after concrete was thrown through the glass of their squad car, said Edward A. Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief. He also said three Milwaukee county sheriff’s deputies were injured by bricks and rocks thrown at their bodies. Flynn also said that a riot helmet worn by one officer had a “graze wound to the back of it, probably from a firearm,” he said. “This was not an evening of insignificant risk for our officers,” Flynn said. “But I am grateful to report, and they would be proud to know, that they successfully protected the community last night.” According to police, 14 people — 11 men and three women — were arrested overnight Sunday and into early Monday morning for disorderly conduct. All of the people arrested were from Milwaukee. Three police cars were damaged, while one store had its windows broken, the police said. Authorities also said that their ShotSpotter system — which tracks gunshots — was activated 30 times. “Gunfire remained a problem last night, as well as gunfire in the vicinity of officers that were attempting to … restrain what disorder did occur,” Flynn said at a briefing Monday. He said police officers never returned fire overnight Sunday, adding that there was “one reported use of police force,” though he did not elaborate on what force was used. .@MilwaukeePolice squad car damaged by thrown bricks, rocks and glass bottles near Sherman and Burleigh. pic.twitter.com/FRtRvRc4iL — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) August 15, 2016 Protesters are blocking Fond du Lac and Burleigh St. #MilwaukeeUprising pic.twitter.com/RduFfN7PtA — James E. Causey (@jecausey) August 15, 2016 There were reports of shots fired in parts of the city throughout the night, police said, and video footage from the scene showed crowds facing off with police officers clad in riot gear. Authorities said they used armored vehicles to move into the crowds, while police were also ordering people gathered on the streets to disperse. Even as the city reeled in the aftermath of the demonstrations, authorities also released more details about the shooting that sparked the protests. Police said that the man who was shot Saturday — identified as 23-year-old Sylville K. Smith — was chased by an officer after fleeing a traffic stop about 3:30 p.m. According to Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief, Smith ran to a fenced area and turned to the officer while holding a gun. The officer, who has not been identified, fired at Smith, hitting him twice and killing him. Flynn said there was no evidence that Smith fired the gun he had, which he said held 23 bullets at the time. This shooting was captured by the officer’s body camera, Flynn said during a news conference Sunday. On Monday, Flynn pushed back at suggestions that Smith was unarmed when he was shot, saying again that Smith had a gun in his hand when he was shot. Barrett also said that while he had not seen the full video of the shooting, he saw a still image showing a gun in Smith’s hand. Flynn also said Monday that the autopsy of Smith showed that the 23-year-old was shot in the chest and arm. Smith was the 16th person shot and killed by police so far this year in Wisconsin, according to a Washington Post database tracking such shootings. [Police release more details of fatal shooting] In the hours after that shooting, protests in Wisconsin’s largest city gave way to heated demonstrations that drew national attention. Police said six businesses were set on fire Saturday night and early Sunday morning, while four officers were injured during the chaos. On Sunday morning, community members gathered to help clean up debris from the fires. Smith’s relatives pleaded for peace after the shooting, saying they were heartbroken by his death but adding that the violence would not help anyone. Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a prolific conservative commentator on cable news and social media, blamed “failed liberal urban policies” for Saturday night’s riots. Clarke, who frequently appears on Fox News and pillories President Obama, was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention last month, where he compared the Black Lives Matter protesters to anarchists. “The social order in Milwaukee totally collapsed on Saturday night,” Clarke told Fox Business Network on Monday. “And when the social order collapsed, tribal behavior takes over. And when tribal behavior takes over, the law of the jungle replaces the rule of law, and that’s why you end up with what you saw.” Clarke had asked that the Wisconsin National Guard be mobilized after the violence Saturday night. Gov. Scott Walker (R) said Sunday he activated the Wisconsin National Guard to be ready to help if called upon by law enforcement officials in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee Police Department said in the middle of the night that it had not called on the National Guard, saying that local police and other agencies were still responding. “I join Milwaukee’s leaders and citizens in calling for continued peace and prayer,” Walker said in a statement. “It is also important for citizens to know that Wisconsin is the first state in the nation to have a law requiring an independent investigation anytime there is a shooting by a law enforcement officer that leads to a death. I will not comment on the specifics of the case as it is now under this investigation. I do, however, hope people will give law enforcement the respect that they deserve for working so hard to keep us safe.” Officer taken to hospital for injury after thrown rock breaks windshield of squad near Sherman & Burleigh. pic.twitter.com/At5HDBOXHm — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) August 15, 2016 Cities across the country have been propelled into national headlines in recent years after unrest sparked by how police use force, particularly deadly force. This summer, the nation has also remained on edge after police shot and killed black men in Minnesota and Louisiana, followed quickly by shooting attacks that killed officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Police said the officer who shot and killed Smith is a 24-year-old who has been with the department for six years, three of them as an officer. He was not injured and has been placed on administrative duty during the investigation. Flynn, the police chief, said that the officer is African American, as was Smith. He also said that police were concerned about the officer’s safety and that he was with relatives outside Milwaukee. The shooting on Saturday is being investigated by Wisconsin’s Division of Criminal Investigation, under a state law signed in 2014 that requires the agency to investigate such deaths. “I am saddened by the senseless destruction caused by a handful of citizens in Milwaukee and appeal for calm,” Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement. “I know the vast majority of Milwaukee residents are law-abiding citizens who want and deserve safe neighborhoods and communities. … I pray that the law enforcement officers and firefighters who are working to protect the citizens of Milwaukee will be safe throughout this ordeal and that no other journalists or innocent citizens will be further harmed.” Schimel vowed that the state would “work expeditiously to ensure a thorough and transparent gathering of the facts.” The state agency also investigated the shooting death last year of Anthony Robinson Jr. in Madison. When it concluded its probe, it handed the findings to the local district attorney, who said he would not pursue charges. The current unrest in Milwaukee follows protests and anger last year when the Justice Department said that a former Milwaukee police officer who shot and killed Dontre Hamilton — a man with mental-health problems killed in 2014 — would not face civil rights charges stemming from that shooting. Not long after, the Justice Department said that its Office of Community Oriented Policing Services would begin what is known as a collaborative reform process with the Milwaukee police force. These kinds of reviews are not like the “pattern or practice” probes carried out by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division — like the one just concluded in Baltimore — which can end with agreements involving court orders. Collaborative reviews, by comparison, involve a review of a police department’s polices and practices, followed by an assessment and publicly released progress reports. Milwaukee is one of several major American cities still dealing with a recent spike in bloodshed and violence. Last year, homicides in the city spiked significantly, increasing to 146 deaths from 86 a year earlier. The city also saw increases in the overall numbers of violent crimes, according to police statistics. This story, first published at 8:44 a.m., will be updated throughout the day.

Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.","output":"Based on the information provided, Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, would have learned more about carbon dioxide levels.

Something that can be auburn: Since \\"auburn\\" refers to a color and the question is about what a prism is used to refract, this option is not relevant. 2. Basic building blocks of life: This option refers to the components of life, such as cells or molecules, which do not directly relate to the refraction of light. This is not the answer. 3. Mirrors: Mirrors reflect light, but the question is asking what a prism refracts. So, mirrors are not the answer either. 4. Our nearest star: Our nearest star is the Sun, and though it emits light, the question asks what a prism is used to refract and not what the source of light is. This option is not the answer. 5. Wavelengths and photons: This option directly relates to the description of light provided in the question. Since a prism is used for refracting light and light consists of wavelengths and photons, the prism is used to refract wavelengths and photons. 6. Microwaves: Microwaves, a form of electromagnetic radiation, are not directly relevant to the refraction of light by a prism. This option is not the answer. 7. Triangles: Triangles are a geometric shape and not related to the refraction of light by a prism in this context. This is not the answer. 8. Focusing a lens: While lenses can also redirect light, the question specifically asks what a prism is used to refract. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. Given an analysis of each option, the answer to the question is: wavelengths and photons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Is it true that does the colorado river make it to the ocean based on the following text? Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions, water for thermoelectric power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs -- the latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of the river's natural runoff -- has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s.","output":"Based on the given text, it can be concluded that the Colorado River does not consistently make it to the ocean. The text provides various reasons for this, such as: 1. Reduction in flow due to dams and diversions. 2. Water consumption for thermoelectric power stations. 3. Evaporation losses from reservoirs, which consume more than 15 percent of the river's natural runoff. These factors have led to severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. The Colorado River Delta has shrunk due to decreased freshwater outflow, and thus, it no longer supports suitable habitat for aquatic species. However, it is mentioned that there were instances when the Colorado River reached the ocean during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s, indicating that the river making it to the ocean is a rare and occasional occurrence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1939, Nazi Germany's largest and most powerful battleship, Bismarck, is launched in a ceremony at Hamburg with Adolf Hitler attending. The launching of the hull is seen as the beginning of a new era of German sea power. Two years later, in 1941, British convoys are being ravaged by U-boats and surface raider attacks that cut off supplies essential for Britain's abilities to continue the war. In May, British intelligence discovers the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to break out of the Baltic and into the North Atlantic to attack convoys. Meanwhile, a spy in Norway spots the Bismarck and its escort Prinz Eugen; he attempts to alert the British by telegraph but he is discovered by the Germans and killed. The spy is only able to message that one of the ships is Prince Eugen but is shot before he can message that the second ship was the Bismarck. The man assigned to co-ordinate the hunt is the Admiralty's chief of operations, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), who has been distraught over the death of his wife in an air raid and the sinking of his ship by German ships commanded by Admiral GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tjens (Karel Å tÄpÃ¡nek). Upon receiving his new post, Shepard discovers LÃ¼tjens is the fleet commander on the Bismarck. Shepard's experience of conflict with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and his understanding of LÃ¼tjens allow him to predict the Bismarck's movements. Shepard acts coldly to his staff but comes increasingly to rely on the coolness and skill of his assistant, WRNS Second Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). LÃ¼tjens is also bitter. After the First World War, he considered that he had received no recognition for his efforts in the war. LÃ¼tjens promises the captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann (Carl MÃ¶hner), that this time, he and Germany will be remembered in greatness. Next morning near Iceland Bismarck and Prinz Eugen encounter HMSÂ Hood and HMS Prince of Wales. The four warships engage in a heavy battle. During the battle a shell from Bismarck hits the Hood slightly...

He didn't. He came and sat in front of the bus stop, but he didn't look like he could have enough money to ride the bus.

Here is an article: Pro-Russian activists in Ukraine's industrial centre of Donetsk have proclaimed their independence from Kiev and pledged to hold a referendum in the next month, provoking fears that Moscow could be orchestrating a second Crimea scenario in Ukraine's east. \\"Seeking to create a popular, legitimate, sovereign state, I proclaim the creation of the sovereign state of the people's republic of Donetsk,\\" said a man into a loudspeaker outside the seized regional administration building to a cheering crowd. The protesters said they would hold a referendum no later than 11 May on the region's status, and also asked Russia to ready \\"peacekeeping troops\\", in a scenario reminiscent of the events that led to the annexation of Crimea last month. In Kiev, the interim prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, said events in the east were being carried out according to a script written in Moscow. \\"An anti-Ukrainian plan is being put into operation … under which foreign troops will cross the border and seize the territory of the country,\\" Yatsenyuk told a cabinet meeting in Kiev. \\"We will not allow this.\\" Russia is believed to have massed tens of thousands of troops on the border. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said last week that Putin told her those troops would be removed, but on Monday, Daniel Baer, US ambassador to the OSCE, said there was no sign of this. \\"We have strong evidence that there are tens of thousands of forces on the border and again not in their normal peacetime positions or garrisons,\\" he said. The White House claimed pro-Russian demonstrators in eastern Ukraine were paid outsiders, but declined to specify who it believed provided the money, simply blaming Moscow in general for renewed \\"provocation\\" The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters: \\"We are concerned about several escalatory moves in Ukraine over the weekend. We see these as a result of increased Russian pressure on Ukraine. We saw groups of pro-Russian demonstrators take over government buildings in the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk. \\"If Russia moves into eastern Ukraine, either overtly or covertly, this would be a very serious escalation. We call on President Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilise Ukraine and we caution against further military intervention.\\" Writing in the Guardian, however, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says it is the west, and not Russia, that is guilty of destabilising Ukraine. He says the EU and US have been pursuing an \\"unproductive and dangerous\\" policy in the region. \\"They have been trying to compel Ukraine to make a painful choice between east and west, thus further aggravating internal differences,\\" writes Lavrov, adding that Russia wants Ukraine to carry out constitutional reform and guarantee its status as a non-aligned state that will never accede to Nato. \\"We are not imposing anything on anyone. We just see that if it is not done, Ukraine will continue to spiral into crisis with unpredictable consequences,\\" writes Lavrov. Russia's foreign ministry said it was \\"carefully observing\\" events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for \\"real constitutional reform\\" to turn the country into a federation. Moscow told Ukraine to stop blaming Russia for its problems. At a meeting with security chiefs in Moscow on Monday, Putin called for vigilance against foreign-funded NGOs promoting political unrest in Russia. \\"We will not accept a situation like what happened in Ukraine, when in many cases it was through non-governmental organisations that the nationalist and neo-Nazi groups and militants, who became the shock troops in the anti-constitutional coup d'etat, received funding from abroad,\\" he said. How much current events in eastern Ukraine are under the control of the Kremlin is unclear, but when Putin appealed to the Russian parliament for authorisation to use troops in Ukraine in February, the resolution did not specify that it applied to Crimea only, leaving the door open for a further incursion into the east. In Donetsk and other eastern Ukrainian cities, which are largely Russian-speaking, there is real discontent with the new government in Kiev, which has been in power since President Viktor Yanukovych fled at the culmination of months of street protests. Nevertheless, the region is far less pro-Russian than Crimea, and analysts say Russia would find it harder and more complicated to introduce troops there. In Donetsk on Monday, the regional administration centre was surrounded with tyres and razor wire and the Russian flag was flying. In Lugansk, another eastern city, activists seized a building beloning to security services. In Kharkov, two protests, one in favour of Ukrainian unity and the other pro-Russian, clashed across police lines in the afternoon. The protests are believed to be being carried out by a small minority in each city. Nevertheless, Russian complaints that the east and south of the country are not being given a voice in the new government have been echoed by some in Kiev itself. Mustafa Nayem, a journalist who was one of the instigators of the protest that led to the ousting of Yanukovych, complained that the new government had not done enough to reassure the east. \\"Since Viktor Yanukovych fled, more than a month has passed, and during that time not a single leader from the new government has been to Donetsk, Kharkov or Lugansk. It is unclear who is representing the interests of people in these regions at a national level,\\" he wrote on Facebook on Sunday. He said the government should hold cabinet meetings in the east, visit local elites and involve them in decision making, rather than \\"sitting in Kiev like cowards\\". Also on Monday, Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister who is standing in presidential elections planned for 25 May, flew to Donetsk for consultations. Ukraine is already reeling from losing the Crimea peninsula to Russia, where there were reports in the morning that a Ukrainian army officer had been shot dead by a Russian soldier. Russia now has full control over the region, and Ukraine's natural resources minister estimates that Ukraine lost 10.8bn of natural resources and other assets in the annexation. Russia, meanwhile, has claimed that Ukraine has accrued a de facto debt of 11bn after the cancelling of a gas discount that it says was given in advance. Even Ukraine admits that it has a 2.2bn debt for gas, and Gazprom said it had not received any money towards this amount of, nor any payment for March deliveries. It is unclear what the next step will be and whether Gazprom will turn off supplies. Last week Gazprom raised the price by 80% to 485 per 1000 cubic metres, meaning Ukraine would pay a higher price for gas than western European countries. Yatsenyuk called the price \\"political\\" and said Ukraine would not pay.

Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

I have so much I want to do first.\\" In a book published last year, Hawking wrote that God did not create the universe, in what he said was an attempt to banish a divine creator from physics.

Here is an article: A rapper and his wife were found dead in an upscale Los Angeles apartment on Monday in an apparent murder-suicide, police said. Songwriter Earl Hayes and Stephanie Moseley, an actress and dancer on VH1′s drama series “Hit the Floor,” were discovered Monday morning after police responded to a call reporting gunshots. Los Angeles police officer Liliana Preciado told The Washington Post investigators are treating the shooting as a murder-suicide in which Hayes, who once signed with professional boxer Floyd Mayweather’s record label, allegedly killed his wife before turning the gun on himself. The motive is unknown. “I suddenly heard screaming,” Hayes’s neighbor Charles Segal told NBC Los Angeles, “and then the screaming stopped and the next minute cops all over.” The initial caller reported about 10 shots in the Park La Brea housing complex on Hauser Boulevard, police told CBS Los Angeles. Officers arrived at about 7:30 a.m. and, once inside, heard two more shots. A room in the apartment was locked, and officers believed someone was barricaded inside. A SWAT team later entered a bedroom and found two bodies. The investigation is “moving very slow and methodical … because they want to get it right,” LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery told NBC Los Angeles. Burrel L. Wilks said he was Hayes’s life coach and knew the couple well. “I’ve had sit downs with both of them so whatever happened behind those doors we’ll never know, but I heard out of her own mouth, he never raised a hand on her so this is kind of stunning,” he told the station. Moseley starred on “Hit the Floor,” a show about NBA cheerleaders, and danced for many artists, including Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Britney Spears as well as Chris Brown, who paid tribute to the dancer on his Instagram. “RIP baby girl,” Brown wrote. “Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family.” Celebrities such as Ashley Tisdale, 50 Cent and “Dancing With the Stars” performer Allison Holker also commented on social media. “Today we bow our heads and send prayers to our special Stephanie and her beautiful family,” Holker wrote on Instagram. “Stephanie was a bright, inspiring, talented woman and I am honored I could call her my friend. We shared cries, laughter and more importantly a friendship that I will never forgot. Moseley you taught me so much, and I will hold our memories close to my heart. Heaven is lucky to have you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Trying to snap a two-game losing streak and keep any playoff hope alive, the Panthers went home for a Week 14 fight with the New York Giants.  For this game, QB Chris Weinke would be making his first start since 2002, as he stood in place for an injured Jake Delhomme (thumb injury). In the first quarter, the Panthers trailed as Giants kicker Jay Feely nailed a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Carolina's troubles increased as QB Eli Manning completed a 28-yard TD to WR Plaxico Burress.  The Panthers would get on the board with Weinke completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Drew Carter, while kicker John Kasay nailed a 37-yard field goal.  However, the G-Men continued to pound out some frustrations as Manning completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey.  In the third quarter, Carolina's struggles continued with Feely kicking a 29-yard field goal, while Manning completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR David Tyree.  In the fourth quarter, the only sort of comeback Carolina could muster was Kasay's 45-yard field goal.  Despite Weinke throwing for 423 yards (with his 61 attempts becoming the second highest of his career), he threw 3 interceptions.  With their third-straight loss, the Panthers fell to 6-7. Ask a question about this article.","output":"So, there was a football game between the Panthers and the New York Giants. The Panthers really wanted to win to have a chance at the playoffs. Their main quarterback, Jake, was hurt, so another player named Chris had to play.  In the game, the Giants started strong and scored first. The Panthers tried really hard to catch up, but the Giants kept getting more points. Even though Chris threw the ball very far and tried his best, he made some mistakes too.  In the end, the Giants won the game, and the Panthers were a little sad because they lost again.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  and the situation: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent.  Answer the following question: Who will develop infections more frequently? A:","output":"Based on the provided background information, Robert, who has been infected with HIV for many years, will likely develop infections more frequently. This is because, over time, the number of helper T cells declines, which weakens the immune system's ability to defend the body against various infections. Since Robert's infection has been for a longer duration, his immune system would be more compromised than Justin's, who has a recent infection. As a result, Robert is more susceptible to frequent infections compared to Justin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Official: Investigators used infrared scanners to pinpoint Guzman's location. Wiretaps and informants helped authorities to close in.","output":"Title: \\"El Chapo Captured: Inside the Operation That Ended a Decade-Long Manhunt\\" Introduction: For more than a decade, Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman, the notorious Sinaloa cartel boss, evaded law enforcement officials. As the world's most wanted man, his capture seemed an almost impossible feat. However, on one fateful day, with the help of cutting-edge technology and vital intelligence, authorities successfully closed in on Guzman, signaling a major victory against drug cartels. This article delves into the details of the operation that led to Guzman's capture, illustrating the complexities behind it, and shedding light on the risks involved in bringing him to justice. The Capture of Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman:  (Step 1: Explain the situation during the raid. Mention the AK-47 next to his bed.) During the raid, Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman was found lying in his bed with an AK-47 placed next to him. The presence of the weapon signaled the danger posed to the law enforcement officers involved in the operation, making it clear that Guzman was prepared to take extreme measures to protect himself and resist capture. (Step 2: Discuss his capture after more than a decade on the run.) After more than a decade of evading capture and slipping through the hands of the authorities, the Sinaloa cartel boss was finally captured, bringing an end to a long-drawn manhunt that spanned continents and captivated the attention of the world. Authorities managed to navigate through a tangled web of deception, danger, and secrecy to finally apprehend Guzman, marking a significant moment in the war against drug cartels. (Step 3: Explain the use of modern technology in the form of infrared scanners during the investigation.) In a fascinating twist, it was the use of infrared scanners that ultimately helped pinpoint Guzman's location. These advanced surveillance devices enabled investigators to accurately detect the heat signatures emitted by the cartel boss, his associates, and surrounding equipment, giving them a crucial advantage in their pursuit. By employing this groundbreaking technology, officials were able to overcome the challenges posed by Guzman's carefully crafted protective measures, thereby closing in on him more effectively. (Step 4: Mention the use of wiretaps and informants in the operation.) Furthermore, the operation leveraged an intricate network of wiretaps and informants that aided investigators in understanding Guzman's operations, movements, and—the crucial piece—his whereabouts. These invaluable sources of intelligence allowed authorities to better plan their assault on the Sinaloa cartel boss, ensuring maximum chances of success with minimum risks to law enforcement personnel. Conclusion: The capture of Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman is a testament to the determination, skill, and innovation of law enforcement officials who relentlessly pursued one of the world's most feared cartel leaders. The story of the operation highlights the importance of collaboration, advanced technology, and solid intelligence networks in the fight against organized crime and drug cartels. Ultimately, Guzman's capture serves as a beacon of hope that justice can be delivered, no matter how elusive or powerful the nemesis may be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the man that the person who fall for gardener serves? from the following article ?  The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter.
