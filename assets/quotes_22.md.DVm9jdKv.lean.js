He did not recognize the impact of the feat until after the game, when he learned that Bobby Murcer had died. Rodriguez has known of Murcer since Rodriguez’s early years in Seattle, when his manager at the time, Lou Piniella, often invoked Murcer in stories. Piniella and Murcer were teammates and friends on the Yankees, fellow outfielders in the post-Mantle era. “From what I understand, he was supposed to be the next Mickey Mantle,” Rodriguez said of Murcer. “There are no random events. I’m sure it’s a sign, somehow, the day that I pass Mantle. Bobby will be watching us. He’ll be cheering on the Yankees for all time.” Rodriguez led off the fourth inning by driving a 3-2 pitch from Brian Tallet off the left-field foul pole at the Rogers Centre. It was his 537th career home run, putting him 13th on the career list. Mike Schmidt is next, with 548. The homer was the final run of the game, which started with a flurry of scoring and ended with a string of shutout innings from Yankees relievers. Darrell Rasner (5-7) gave up four runs in the first, but he made it through five innings to earn the victory. “I was able to hang in there and get the team back in the dugout to score some runs,” Rasner said. “I tip my hat to them. They gave me a second chance.”","output":"In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Alex Rodriguez surpassed Mickey Mantle's career home run record, hitting his 537th home run in the Yankees’ 9-4 victory.

Women and girls: Title IX has played a significant role in promoting gender equality in education, particularly in sports and athletics. It has led to a substantial increase in the participation of women in collegiate sports, which in turn has created more opportunities for scholarships and personal development.   2. Men and boys: While Title IX is often associated with women and girls, it also protects men and boys from sex-based discrimination in educational programs and activities. This includes providing equal opportunities for male athletes in sports that have traditionally been underrepresented, such as men's volleyball, gymnastics, and swimming.   3. LGBTQ+ individuals: Title IX's prohibition of sex discrimination has been interpreted to include protection for students who are discriminated against based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. This helps ensure a safe and inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students in educational institutions that receive federal funding.   4. Pregnant and parenting students: Title IX requires schools to provide equal educational opportunities to pregnant and parenting students, ensuring that they have access to the same programs, extracurricular activities, and accommodations as other students.   5. Victims of sexual harassment and assault: Title IX obligates schools to take appropriate action to prevent, respond to, and remedy instances of sexual harassment and assault. This includes providing support services and accommodations for survivors, as well as ensuring a fair process for resolving complaints.

Answer this question: where is the coldest inhabited place on earth??","output":"The coldest inhabited place on Earth is Oymyakon, a small village located in the Sakha Republic, also known as the Republic of Yakutia, in Russia. With an extreme subarctic climate, Oymyakon is situated in the northeast region of the country, about 9,318 kilometers (5,786 miles) east of Moscow. The nearest city to Oymyakon is Yakutsk, which lies approximately 574 kilometers (357 miles) away, and the village sits 750 meters (2,460 feet) above sea level. Oymyakon gained its reputation as the coldest permanently inhabited place on Earth due to its extraordinarily low temperatures, particularly during the winter months. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the village was -67.7°C (-89.9°F) on February 6, 1933, but temperatures regularly fall below -50°C (-58°F) during winter. The harsh winter climate in Oymyakon is characterized by an extended period of polar nights, with daylight lasting for only a few hours each day. These extreme conditions are caused by Oymyakon's geographical position, as it lies deep within the Eurasian continent and is surrounded by high mountain ranges. The cold air becomes trapped in the valley, causing the temperature to plummet. Despite these extreme conditions, Oymyakon is home to around 500 residents. The people living here are primarily Yakut, which is an ethnic group with Mongolian roots, and their unique way of life has allowed them to adapt to this challenging environment. Some of the measures taken to survive in Oymyakon include having well-insulated homes with thick walls, keeping a supply of wood for heating, and ensuring that their livestock can withstand the frigid temperatures. Moreover, the local economy primarily revolves around reindeer herding, fur trade, ice-fishing, and hunting. There is also limited agriculture, mainly focused on growing winter-hardy vegetables like potatoes and carrots. Life in Oymyakon is far from easy, with everyday tasks such as keeping water pipes from freezing and vehicles operational or the extreme difficulty of burying the deceased in frozen ground requiring significant effort. However, the people of Oymyakon manage to survive thanks to their hardiness and determination. In recent times, Oymyakon has also become a destination for tourists seeking unique adventure experiences. Visitors to the village often come to witness its extreme weather firsthand, partake in traditional Yakutian activities, and gain insight into the unique lifestyle and culture of the inhabitants. In conclusion, Oymyakon is considered the coldest inhabited place on Earth, with temperatures regularly dropping below -50°C (-58°F) during the harsh winter months. Although the challenging climate and isolated location may seem like a deterrent, the resilient and adaptable people of Oymyakon prove that human life can survive and even thrive in the planet's most extreme environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Evaluation Synthesis.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The evaluation synthesis is important.\\" true?","output":"To generate a detailed and long answer, we first need to understand and unpack the terms provided. \\"Evaluation synthesis\\" refers to the process of reviewing, analyzing, and summarizing information, assessments, or evaluations from multiple sources, while considering different viewpoints, approaches, and findings. The main objective of this process is to provide a comprehensive overview and understanding of a topic, phenomenon, or research question. This can aid in decision-making, generating recommendations, improving policies or practices, and identifying gaps in knowledge. With the premise defined, let us now focus on the hypothesis: \\"The evaluation synthesis is important.\\" To effectively evaluate the importance of the evaluation synthesis, we can examine its various aspects, the context in which it is used, and the potential outcomes of utilizing this process. 1. Enhancing decision-making capabilities: Evaluation synthesis aids decision-making by providing a clear, organized, and comprehensive overview of the available information. By examining various sources, this process can help decision-makers identify commonalities and differences, strengths, and weaknesses, and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. In turn, this can lead to the formulation of well-informed decisions, which can significantly impact organizations, policies, and practices positively.  2. Facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing: Evaluation synthesis fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among various stakeholders, such as researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and communities. By pooling and integrating different perspectives, data, and insights, this process not only encourages the cross-fertilization of ideas but also highlights collective wisdom and mitigates potential biases or blind spots.  3. Highlighting gaps and opportunities: The evaluation synthesis process can expose gaps in knowledge, areas where existing research is lacking or insufficient, and potential areas for improvement within policies and practices. Recognizing these areas can direct further investments of time, effort, and resources towards addressing identified weaknesses and capitalizing on opportunities for growth and innovation. 4. Maximizing resource utilization: Evaluation synthesis can help stakeholders, organizations, and researchers effectively allocate resources by highlighting projects, programs, or interventions that demonstrate substantial success and evidence of impact. This approach can avoid duplication of efforts and minimize instances of investing in ideas or strategies that may not yield the best results. 5. Supporting transparency and accountability: By making available an organized and synthesized overview of findings, evaluation synthesis contributes to increased transparency and accountability. It allows stakeholders to scrutinize and validate different approaches, ask questions, witness achievements or failures, and gain an understanding of the evidence supporting certain decisions or recommendations. Considering the various benefits and advantages that stem from the evaluation synthesis process, we can confidently support the hypothesis that \\"The evaluation synthesis is important.\\" Utilizing the evaluation synthesis in a range of contexts—from research and policy-making to organizational management and service delivery—bolsters decision-making, facilitates collaboration, highlights gaps, maximizes resource utilization, and promotes transparency and accountability.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are many different varieties of aquatic snail, though the most common varieties you'll encounter are the Gold Inca, mystery, nerite, pond, ramshorn, and trumpet snails. Each one is marked by its own distinct features. Which snail you choose may depend on your aesthetic preferences, your tank's needs, or both.  Gold Inca snails are recognizable by their bright, yellow shells. Gold Inca snails are considered good cleaners of freshwater tanks, as they tend to consume algae and detritus. Ivory snails are identified by their cream-colored shells. Ivory snails are also considered good tank cleaners and \\"scavengers\\" of freshwater aquariums. Mystery snails have a shell that tends to vary in appearance, but is usually somewhat dark (though some are ivory), typically with brown accents or stripes. Mystery snails have a tendency to scavenge, but they can also easily escape tanks and will most likely require a secure lid. Nerite snails come in different shapes, colors, and patterns, depending on the variety of snail. Nerite snails tend to scavenge for algae, but they also burrow into the substrate at the bottom in search of food. Pond snails are one of the most frequently-encountered unwanted snails. Pond snails tend to travel on aquatic plants and in aquarium water, often inadvertently making their way home from the pet store to a new home. Ramshorn snails have a shell that appears to twist and curl, much like the horn on the head of a ram (hence the name). Ramshorn snails are good scavengers, but like pond snails they often end up in home aquariums by accident. Trumpet snails tend to have elongated and cone-shaped shells. Trumpet snails are excellent scavengers, but like pond snails and ramshorn snails, they often appear without invitation in new aquariums due to their ability to sneak in on freshwater plants. Saltwater snails are also a popular addition to many marine tanks. They tend to eat algae and plant matter just like freshwater snails do, but some snails are carnivorous. They also tend to be more colorful than their freshwater counterparts. For this reason, many aquarium enthusiasts prefer saltwater snails for their home tanks. Which snail you choose will largely depend on your personal aesthetics and your home aquarium setup.  Bumble bee snails are carnivorous invertebrates. They typically eat meat-based detritus, including decomposing organisms in the tank, and have been known to eat other snails in the tank when food is scarce.  Cerith snails are easy to care for and can help improve oxygenation within the substrate of an aquarium. They scavenge for algae, detritus, leftover food, and fish waste.  Nassarius snails eat detritus, leftover food, decaying plant material, and fish wastes. They are excellent at keeping aquariums clean as they typically seek out a lot of food within the tank.  Turbo snails are generally easy to care for and tend to be very colorful. They come in a number of varieties, including Astraea turbo snails and chestnut turbo snails, and they tend to feed on algae and dried seaweed flakes. If you're new to keeping aquatic snails, you may be uncertain about what to look for while selecting a snail. Avoid any snail that exhibits a loss of color, a lack of appetite, an inability to move/exert energy, a tendency to hide inside its shell, or visible spots or other types of fungus anywhere on the body or mouth, as these snails are most likely ill or carrying parasites. When you choose a snail, look for the following signs of good health:  active movement within the water a healthy appetite for whatever type of food that snail prefers consistent/evenly-distributed coloring a clean shell It's important to be aware of the risks that come with certain varieties of aquatic snails. Some varieties are considered \\"pests,\\" appearing unexpectedly and reproducing on a large scale. These population booms can reduce oxygen content in the water, increase the levels of carbon dioxide, and create a great deal of organic waste through their excrement and eventual decomposition. When choosing aquatic snails, it's best to select snail varieties that are not generally considered pests by aquarium owners.  Ramshorn snails are considered one of the biggest pest varieties. These snails reproduce quickly and in very large numbers. Pond snails and trumpet snails are also considered pests by many aquarium owners, though some owners select these snails for aesthetic reasons. Talk to an aquarium expert at your local pet store if you're not sure whether a particular variety of snail might become a pest in your tank.

Objective: how to make pecan-praline brownies Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To make pecan-praline brownies, you'll first need to gather your ingredients, prepare your workspace, and then follow the recipe step by step. Here's a detailed and thorough method to help you achieve the perfect pecan-praline brownies: Ingredients: - 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter - 6 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped - 2 cups granulated sugar - 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract - 4 large eggs - 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1 1/2 cups pecan halves, coarsely chopped - 1 cup pecan-coating (recipe below) Pecan Coating: - 1 cup brown sugar - 1/2 cup heavy cream - 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter - 1 tablespoon light corn syrup - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract - 1 1/2 cups roasted and salted pecans, coarsely chopped Instructions: 1. Preparation: Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, letting the paper overhang the edges to facilitate easy removal after baking. 2. Brownie base: In a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, combine the unsalted butter and unsweetened chocolate. Melt in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval until the mixture is smooth and fully melted. Let it cool to room temperature. 3. In a large mixing bowl, add the granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and melted chocolate mixture. Stir them together until combined. 4. Add eggs: One at a time, add the eggs into the mixture, stirring after each addition until fully incorporated. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. 5. Mix in flour and salt: Sift the all-purpose flour and salt onto the mixture. Stir gently until just combined, being cautious not to overmix. Overmixing can lead to tougher brownies. 6. Add chopped pecans: Fold in the coarsely chopped pecan halves, mixing just enough to distribute them evenly. 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula to ensure even baking. 8. Prepare pecan coating: In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, heavy cream, unsalted butter, and light corn syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture forms a syrup-like texture. 9. Remove the pan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and coarsely chopped roasted and salted pecans, ensuring they're evenly coated with the syrup. 10. Dollop the pecan coating evenly over the brownie batter in the pan. Use a spatula to gently swirl the coating into the batter, creating a marbled appearance. 11. Bake: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as this can result in dry brownies. 12. Cool and remove: Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. 13. Cut the pecan-praline brownies into your desired size and serve. This detailed recipe considers naive physics reasoning by listing ingredients, their measurements, and the steps required to achieve a specific outcome. It's important to follow the steps in order, as mixing ingredients or altering cooking times can affect the texture and appearance of the finished brownies. By carefully following the steps and understanding how the ingredients interact in the baking process, you can create delicious pecan-praline brownies that satisfy cravings and impress guests alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To address these questions, I'll break them down into their individual parts. 1. What do Narcissists really think about? Narcissists are characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a strong need for admiration and validation, and an inability to empathize with others. To understand what narcissists think about, I will assume the perspective of a narcissist and analyze their thought process: Step 1: Focus on self: A narcissist's thoughts tend to revolve around themselves, their appearance, achievements, and status. They seek to bolster their self-esteem through positive attention from others, so they may think about how to attract praise or admiration. Step 2: Comparing with others: Narcissists often compare themselves to others and may obsess over their perceived superiority or inferiority. This could involve evaluating their talents, physical appearance, intelligence, or social standing in comparison to their peers. Step 3: Manipulating situations: Narcissists may think about ways to manipulate situations or people to serve their needs and further their self-interest. They may plan tactics for getting their way or orchestrating events to showcase their skills or qualities. Step 4: Lack of empathy: Since narcissists struggle to empathize with others, they are less likely to think about other people's feelings, needs, or perspectives. Their thoughts are predominantly centered on themselves and how they can benefit from different situations. 2. What does a narcissist think about a sociopath? To answer this question, I'll assume a narcissist's perspective and consider their opinion on a sociopath. Step 1: Assess similarities: A narcissist may recognize some similarities with a sociopath, such as manipulation, self-interest, and a lack of empathy. In this sense, they might view sociopaths as individuals who share some of their traits. Step 2: Perceive differences: Despite some similarities, a narcissist may also focus on the differences between themselves and a sociopath. Narcissists crave admiration, whereas sociopaths don't necessarily have that same drive. A narcissist may feel that their desire for admiration sets them apart from a sociopath or even makes them superior. Step 3: Competitiveness: Considering that narcissists are often competitive, they may view a sociopath as a rival or threat in scenarios where social standing, power, or control is at stake. They could feel the need to outperform or outmaneuver a sociopath to maintain their sense of accomplishment or superiority. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are not the same. The first question seeks to understand the general thought patterns and subjects that occupy a narcissist's mind. The second question specifically explores a narcissist's view of sociopaths, focusing on their evaluation of and potential relationship with another personality type. While both questions involve narcissists, they address different aspects of their thought processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dear Foursquare: This Is Not the Right Time to Sell The Social Analyst is a weekly column by Mashable Co-Editor Ben Parr, where he digs into social media trends and how they are affecting companies in the space. It’s undeniable: FoursquareFoursquare is on fire in a way that no startup since TwitterTwitter has come close to achieving. It’s changing the world and acquiring new users at a rapid place, so perhaps that’s why it doesn’t surprise us to learn that Yahoo is aggressively trying to acquire Foursquare. According to Kara Swisher of AllThingsD, Foursquare and its founder Dennis Crowley have two options: raise more money from venture capital firms that would value the company at around 100 million, or be acquired by Yahoo for 125 million or more. These are not small numbers and this is not an easy decision. The payday from Yahoo would be enough for most of the Foursquare team to be very happy for the rest of their lives. Any overtures from the Internet giant should be taken seriously. However, if Crowley and the Foursquare team want to make the kind of worldwide impact that only a handful of people can claim to have achieved — all while building a company with far greater value than the money Yahoo is offering — then it needs to take venture capital money, forgo the immediate payday and amp up Foursquare’s growth to the Facebook and Twitter level. When a hot tech start is acquired by a major technology company, the results have historically been all over the charts. For every YouTubeYouTube success (acquired by GoogleGoogle in 2006), there is a JaikuJaiku failure (acquired by Google in 2007). Sometimes the additional resources of a major tech company can help spur an acquisition to greater heights, while other times bureaucracy can leave it to languish. Unfortunately for Crowley, he’s very familiar with the latter. Crowley’s last company, DodgeballDodgeball, was in many ways the predecessor to Foursquare: It was a location-aware social network for finding interesting venues and notifying friends via text. In 2005, Google acquired Crowley’s startup. Instead of placing resources behind Dodgeball to develop its social networking capabilities, Google left it to languish in obscurity until it eventually shut down in 2009. Yahoo’s track record on acquisitions is also hit-or-miss. Since its inception, Yahoo has acquired more than 55 companies. Most of them have become the foundations of key Yahoo properties such as Yahoo Search, Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Fantasy Sports. Some, like FlickrFlickr, are running strong, while others such as Geocities, Broadcast.com and del.icio.us have either languished or been shut down. If Foursquare’s team cares about transforming the world with location-based social media — as all of our interactions with them have indicated — it should be very wary of losing its independence. Yahoo’s track record is mixed. Let’s say that Foursquare believes that Yahoo is a good fit for the company, and let’s also assume that it has talked with Yahoo about ways to assure that the same mistakes that occurred with the Google-Dodgeball acquisition don’t happen again. Is a 100 to 150 million payday a smarter deal than staying independent and taking a chance with the market? To answer that question, you have to weigh potential against chance. Is the potential growth of the company worth the risk associated with trying to go it alone with Foursquare? How big could Foursquare potentially be? Exit strategies: If Foursquare were to turn down the Yahoo offer, who would be able to buy it? Or is there legitimate potential for an IPO? These are complex issues, but if I were a betting man (and in fact, I am), I’d place my money on Foursquare being the next Twitter, rather than turning into the next FriendsterFriendster. Its growth has only been accelerating and its profile has been rising rapidly. It has the opportunity to raise enough cash to build out the team and keep building up the userbase. It has the chance to stay independent and pursue its vision for a better-connected, mobile-centric world. Here’s the real reason why I believe in Foursquare, though: it directly addresses the human need to be social in a completely useful way. Facebook and Twitter revolutionized the world because they provided easier, more efficient outlets for socializing with friends and keeping up with what they were doing. Foursquare takes it a step further by factoring in our desire to know where our friends are on top of what they are doing. Look: Foursquare is not my company, and I’d have a hard time making a decision if someone waved 125 million in my face. But if Foursquare’s passion and goal is to make location-based social networking mainstream, then it’s better off as an independent company where it can follow that vision unwaveringly. If the groundswell of grassroots support that created Foursquare Day is any indication, the company has far more potential than the figures that are being thrown out now. This is the time to put the pedal to the metal, not the time to sell.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February.

With those kinds of odds , I ' m much better off at a craps table in Vegas . Still , I was foolhardy enough - and , like most writers , unreasonably optimistic - to think that I might creep into that glorious one percent . Why is the narrator so pessimistic at the moment ?","output":"The narrator's current pessimism is likely a result of a combination of factors, largely tied to the difficulty and frustration associated with attempting to gain recognition and success in the world of fiction writing. Based on their statement, it appears that the rejection rate for fiction writers stands around a disheartening 99%, indicating that only one out of hundred work gets accepted. This fact alone is enough to instil a sense of pessimism, seeing the odds stacked so heavily against their favor. Moreover, with such steep odds, the narrator feels their chances would be better spent at a craps table in Vegas, a metaphor that emphasizes their disappointment and illustrates the perceived randomness and luck involved in getting a piece of-fiction accepted or recognized. It emphasizes the reality that talent and hard work does not always lead to immediate success in the literary field, and luck plays a crucial role in making a mark in this creative world. In addition, the narrator's admission of being \\"foolhardy\\" and \\"unreasonably optimistic\\" to think they might break into the successful one percent reflects the emotional exhaustion and frustration they're experiencing. This not only indicates the competitive nature of the writing industry but also their own struggle to hold onto hope in the face of continuous rejection. Writers often pour their heart and soul into their work, making each rejection personally and emotionally painful.  This optimism, viewed by the narrator as \\"unreasonable\\" also speaks about the quintessential writer's paradox, which oscillates between humility and an inflated sense of self-assuredness. It highlights their initial naivety and their gradual descent into pessimism due to the harsh realities of the literary world. Finally, this pessimism may also stem from the feeling of isolation commonly experienced by writers. The process of writing can be solitary and when coupled with lack of success or recognition, it can lead to pessimistic thoughts and a decrease in self-confidence. Therefore, the narrator's pessimism could be partially explained as a coping mechanism against the harsh criticism and widespread rejection that comes in the field of writing. So, the combination of seemingly insurmountable odds, ongoing rejections, emotional exhaustion, inherent complexities of a writer's thought process and the isolating nature of the craft, all contribute to the narrator's current state of pessimism. However, it's noteworthy that despite such adversity, the narrator is still motivated and resilient enough to carry on with their pursuit, underlining their dedication towards their writing journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Hollywood's tribute to the Weather Underground is set for limited release in the U.S. next Friday. Left-wing actors like Robert Redford, Susan Sarandon and other stars in the movie called \\"The Company You Keep.\\" Now this is a film that effectively romanticizes this domestic terror group. Now here's how Hollywood plans on honoring the radical organization that was, of course, founded by President Obama's old pal, Bill Ayers. Watch. (BEGIN \\"THE COMPANY YOU KEEP\\" TRAILER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Former Weather Underground leader Sharon Solarz -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One of the longest fugitives on the FBI's most wanted list was arrested yesterday 30 years after the notorious Bank of Michigan robbery that resulted in the death of a guard. JACKIE EVANCHO AS \\"ISABEL GRANT\\": What's wrong? You look weird. ROBERT REDFORD AS \\"JIM GRANT/NICK SLOAN\\": I'm fine, honey. SHIA LABEOUF AS \\"BEN SHEPARD\\": I look at the man's history, the man doesn't exist before 1979. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fugitive Nicholas Sloan had been exposed by a reporter living as a lawyer named James Grant. TERRENCE HOWARD AS \\"CORNELIUS\\": Does Grant have any family? ANNA KENDRICK AS \\"DIANA\\": A daughter, 11. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are you going? LABEOUF: I don't think he's running away. I think he is trying to clear his name. SUSAN SARANDON AS \\"SHARON SOLARZ\\": Our government was murdering millions. We never betrayed each other, any of us, over all of these years. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got a full green light. SARANDON: What are you willing to take a risk for? HANNITY: Now let's remember, the horrific history of the Weather Underground. In 1970, the group planted a pipe bomb at the San Francisco Police Department, one person was killed. Also that year the NYPD was targeted with dynamite and seven injured that case. And then three Weathermen were killed while trying to assembly IEDs in New York City. In 1971 and '72, both the U.S. capitol and the Pentagon were hit, and 1981, two police officers and one Brinks guard were killed during an armed robbery orchestrated by Underground members. Sadl,y this is what Hollywood is choosing to celebrate? But I expect nothing else from people like Redford, Susan Sarandon and others. Joining me now with reaction, Fox News contributor, Michelle Malkin. I guess, you know, they're supposed to be the heroes who stand for their beliefs, is that how this plays out according to Deadline Hollywood? MICHELE MALKIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you know what an emetic is? Something that induces nausea and vomiting? Well, this trailer is a Hollywood manufactured emetic. And Robert Redford and Susan Sarandon and all of their left-wing pals who glorify those who have blood on their hands are human emetics. This is blood boiling for so many reasons, particularly because the plot of the movie, which involves a bank robbery and has rose-colored glasses about these sympathetic Weather Underground type members, I think, defiles the memory of all of the innocent victims and particularly the three who died in the real life bank robbery in the last incident that you mentioned in 1981. There were two police officers and a security guard, Peter Page, Waverly Brown, and Edward O'Grady and those names, of course, mean nothing. They're mud to the likes of these Hollywood directors and actors who, of course, will then get accolades and probably win Oscar awards for their performances. But I think what needs to happen is that the victims of all domestic terrorism and particularly Weather Underground and black liberation army which were involved in that particular bank robbery, need to show up at all of these events, on the red carpet and make these people confront the real life violence that they are glorifying. HANNITY: And then, of course, later he'll become an esteemed professor at a liberal university like University of Chicago, and then of course, you can start the political career of Barack Obama in your house and give speeches with Obama and sit on boards with Obama. I know, it's all -- we still haven't gotten an answer and it still irritates me. Let me show you the video, maybe like father like son. We've got actor Sean Penn who is known for going off on paparazzi and photographers -- here he walks in and interestingly, he didn't do anything, but then his son, 19 years old, follows up and -- watch this video. PAPARAZZI: What the hell! You (EXPLETIVE) kidding me? Don't do that. Don't ever do that, dude. PAPARAZZI: Don't do that to yourself, you're a kid -- PENN: (EXPLETIVE) you, fool! (EXPLETIVE) this fool, you're a (EXPLETIVE) ( EXPLETIVE)! PAPARAZZI: Oh, word? That's the kind of -- PAPARAZZI: That's the kind of talk you're teaching him, Sean? Summary:","output":"\\"The Company You Keep,\\" a Hollywood film set for limited release, has sparked controversy as it seemingly romanticizes the domestic terror group, the Weather Underground. Containing well-known left-wing actors such as Robert Redford and Susan Sarandon, the movie brings to light the radical organization once founded by Bill Ayers, President Obama's old friend. Critics argue that the film glorifies those who have blood on their hands, defiling the memory of the many innocent victims who suffered at the hands of the Weather Underground. The film's upcoming release raises concerns regarding Hollywood's portrayal of such organizations and its potential impact on the public's view of domestic terrorism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The development boom in San Francisco’s downtown is proving to be an unexpected windfall for archaeologists in the bay area. Construction crews working on the City’s 1.6 billion Central Subway project recently unearthed pieces of nineteenth century industrial type sewing machines which experts believe may have been used in a basement (the machines were discovered 8 feet below the street surface) Chinatown factory – most likely destroyed in the catastrophic earthquake of 1906.      Construction on the Central Subway project, which will connect Chinatown and the area south of Market with a municipal light rail line, has become a familiar sight for visitors and residents alike in the eastern neighborhoods of San Francisco in recent years.      But look close enough and you’ll see something very different to most construction sites; working side by side with construction crews excavating tunnels are archaeological crews excavating for historical artifacts. California requires almost all new developments to have archaeologists as part of their team, and these above-and-beyond efforts have unearthed historical relics not seen in over a hundred years.      Recently, at the Stockton Street construction site, between Washington and Jackson street, about 8 feet beneath the sidewalk and directly in front of the building housing the Chinese Americans Citizens Alliance, researchers chipped at bricks and dirt to uncover the sewing machines. Like other artifacts from other eras that have been discovered at construction sites around the city, this new discovery will contribute its own unique information about life in Chinatown and San Francisco in the late 1800’s.      According to Adrian Praetzellis, with the Anthropological Studies Center at Sonoma State University, the find is unprecedented. With so little remaining of the Chinatown which existed before the 1906 earthquake, these pieces of sewing machines could very well be the last remaining remnants of the community that lived there at the turn of the century. The university is just one of six archaeological consultants the city has hired to excavate construction sites      Once the historical items are removed the team of archaeologists will take the parts to their lab and work to discover who used the machines and how they came to be under a sidewalk in Chinatown for over a century.      The sewing machines are a unique find given the era in which they were used and where they were found. These archaeological discoveries however, have become increasingly common due to the amount of construction work in the city. The development boom has also allowed the city to create a geographic information system (GIS) that describes and documents layers which align with a particular era. Since 2006, five layers have been defined: Chinese, maritime resources, prehistoric, the Yerba Buena period and the Spanish/Mexican period, with plans to cover other eras such as the Gold Rush period.      The GIS layers are used to determine whether a construction site will require further archaeological excavation. For example, projects that propose digging to certain depths, 2 feet to 8 feet depending on the area, will automatically trigger additional studies.      According to City planners, the history of San Francisco has shown that the same areas of the city are continually redeveloped and what remains underground is worth preserving. ||||| Residents and visitors of San Francisco’s eastern neighborhoods in recent years have likely witnessed the construction of the Central Subway, a 1.6 billion project that will ultimately link Chinatown and South of Market via a Muni light rail line for the first time.      But amid the ubiquitous work to make way for the new Muni line by 2019, crews have also been excavating for historical artifacts as part California’s environmental requirements of most new construction in The City.      While such an effort is not only mandated by state law, it’s also helping to reunite San Francisco with relics from its past not seen in over a century.      ↓ Continue Reading Below [advertisement] [advertisement]      At the Central Subway construction site on Stockton Street between Jackson and Washington streets Monday, beneath the sidewalk in front of what is now the Chinese Americans Citizens Alliance building, archaeologists chipped away at bricks and dirt 8 feet below the street to uncover pieces of what turned out to be 19th century industrial sewing machines.      The sewing machines are believed to have been used in the basement of a Chinatown factory that likely either crumbed or burned down in the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire. Much like other artifacts from various eras uncovered during the excavation of construction sites, Monday’s discovery shed a unique light on life in Chinatown in the late 1800s.      “This is unprecedented in our experience,” said Adrian Praetzellis, director of the Anthropological Studies Center at Sonoma State University. “There’s very little that remains of Chinatown prior to the [1906] earthquake, so this is basically the last remains of the earliest Chinatown.”      The university is one of a half-dozen archaeological consultants hired by The City to excavate construction sites. After digging out the historical items, which will likely take several days, the Sonoma State archeology team will bring the sewing machine parts back to their lab and try to uncover the mystery of who used them and how they ended up beneath a Chinatown sidewalk.      Dana Shew, an oral historian and archaeologist at Sonoma State, plans to visit the national archives in San Bruno next week to study the merchant file for the site’s former address, 1018 Stockton St. Shew said she can potentially find the names of the men and women who used the sewing machines that have been buried beneath Chinatown for over a century.      While the sewing machines are a unique find for archeologists because of the era from which they were used, as well as the location where they were found, the discovery of historical objects in San Francisco is becoming increasingly common because of The City’s development boom.      “We have been so busy in The City for almost the last 10 years,” said Michael Stoyka, an archeological and bone specialist at Sonoma State. “A lot of this development leads to us being here.”      Archaeological studies of construction sites in The City have taken a new twist in the past decade as well with the creation of geographic information system (GIS) layers that align with a particular period of time. As of today, five layers have been developed since 2006: maritime resources, Chinese, prehistoric, the Spanish/Mexican period and the Yerba Buena period.      “There are future areas we’ll cover as well, like the Gold Rush period,” said Randall Dean, the Planning Department’s only full-time archaeologist. “The game plan is to work with additional ethnic groups [to develop] new layers.”      Allison Vanderslice, who splits her time between archaeology and preservation for the Planning Department, said the GIS layers are used to help determine whether a construction site requires further excavation for potential historic purposes. Projects that propose to dig to certain depths – 2 feet in some areas, 8 in others, for instance – automatically trigger sensitivity studies.      Much of the development today aligns with archaeologically sensitive areas, particularly in neighborhoods like Yerba Buena, South of Market, Mission Dolores, Mission Bay and the Bayview, said Sarah Jones, The City’s director of environmental planning.      “If you think about the history of San Francisco and all the things that have happened over time, it’s the same areas that keep seeing development and change over and over,” Jones said. “There’s a whole city underneath the ground that we can’t see, and we want to make sure we don’t lose that.”      And as the development boom continues to adorn The City with new skyscrapers, deeper excavation occurs, potentially drumming up slivers of history.      “What’s happening now is you’re having taller buildings, so our foundations are going deeper,” Vanderslice said. “You might have had multiple building episodes on one site over time, [but] what’s being built now is definitely going to take out the archaeological record as it goes down 20, 30, 40 feet sometimes.”      For the Sonoma State team, beaming Monday at the discovery of the rusty sewing machine pieces, the construction boom means more opportunities to dig for history – even though, at some point, there won’t be anything left to find.      “They’re not making archaeological sites anymore, so once development comes in and destroys a site it’s gone forever,” said Praetzellis, the Sonoma State professor. “At some point there’s going to be none left. With the rate of development in San Francisco, that’s not going to be far into the future.”      Click here or scroll down to comment ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"During the construction of San Francisco's 1.6 billion Central Subway project, crews have discovered 19th-century industrial sewing machines, believed to have been used in a Chinatown factory destroyed during the 1906 earthquake.

A CreditCards.com analysis of how difficult or easy it is for the average American to read and understand a credit card agreement shows some of the worst contracts have improved somewhat in the past few months but are still too complex for the average consumer.      READABILITY FOLLOW-UP In a follow-up to its July 2010 credit card agreement readability study, CreditCards.com looked at the 20 most difficult to read and the 20 wordiest contracts to see if any had improved between July and October. Only six of the 20 most difficult-to-read contracts showed improvement. Nine of the 20 had the same reading level, three were more difficult to read and two were no longer offered by the credit card issuer. All were still rated at the 12th grade reading level or higher -- too difficult for four out of five adults to understand.      That's the key finding of a CreditCards.com follow-up to our July 2010 analysis of the readability of all major U.S. credit card agreements . For this follow-up, we looked again at the worst offenders -- the ones we had identified in July as most difficult to read and the wordiest contracts. The goal: to see if the most recent of the contracts submitted to the Federal Reserve each quarter were any more readable than the first batch. (See methodology .)      Under the Credit CARD Act of 2009, major credit card issuers in the United States are required to submit copies of their credit card agreements to the Fed, which must post them to the Web.      The July analysis found that the initial contracts submitted to the Fed required a 12th grade reading level on average to understand. The average American adult in the United States reads at only the ninth grade level.      Although consumer credit counselors advise cardholders to be sure to read and know the terms of their credit cards, four out of five adults don't read well enough to understand the average credit card agreement.      In the follow-up analysis, many of the worst agreements showed improvement -- meaning new contracts submitted to the Fed and analyzed with the same readability software programs were slightly better than earlier versions of the contracts. However, all were still tough reading for average adults.      \\"The reason these agreements are typically complex is that they have lots of hidden fees and traps,\\" says Josh Frank, a senior researcher for the Center for Responsible Lending, a North Carolina-based consumer group. \\"What's in the complexity can cause the consumer problems ... can do them financial harm.\\"      Safer credit cards      The National Consumer Law Center identified simple terms and clear disclosure as one of the top 11 features of a \\"safer credit card\\" in a report issued Nov. 18, 2010. \\"The terms must be simple enough and disclosed clearly enough that they are likely to be noticed and understood by the vast majority of cardholders,\\" according to the report.      Consumer groups are hoping that the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- currently being organized by former Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren in the U.S. Treasury Department -- will make clarity and simple credit card terms one of its first tasks. However, the agency won't likely be up and fully functioning until late 2011. So, consumers shouldn't expect to be able to speed read through their credit card agreements any time soon.      The reason these agreements are typically complex is that they have lots of hidden fees and traps. -- Josh Frank      Center for Responsible Lending      \\"Elizabeth Warren is putting a focus on complexity in card agreements,\\" Frank said. \\"I expect that there will be some change there, but it's hard to say how soon. I would expect it in the long term.\\"      Frank conducted a different kind of analysis of credit card terms, but came to the same conclusion about complexity. \\"Numbers Game,\\" published in October 2010, analyzed the total number of numeric figures contained in typical credit card offers as a measure of the complexity of the deals. They found that between 1999 and 2009, the complexity of terms offered in the Schumer Box -- a table that summarizes terms of the credit card offer -- rose by 250 percent. However, the complexity began to decline in 2010 after the bulk of the CARD Act reform provisions took effect.      Frank said the days of hidden fees and terms aren't likely over. \\"In the long term, I think there will be other tricks to look for,\\" he said.      Language doesn't matter?      Nick Bourke, director of the Pew Safe Credit Cards Project, which is conducting ongoing research and monitoring card industry practices, acknowledged that the new credit card reform law has benefited consumers by preventing credit card issuers from hiking interest rates \\"at any time for any reason.\\"      \\"Even if the language is still complicated, what's behind the language is a little bit more straightforward,\\" he said. If agreements are written in simple language, that doesn't guarantee that the terms are fair, Bourke said. \\"If they say, 'We will credit your incoming payments in a way that is suitable to the banks,' those are pretty simple words.\\" Previously, banks and credit unions would put monthly payments toward balances with the lowest interest first. This meant consumers paid more in interest on balances with higher rates. That practice, known as payment allocation, is now banned by the CARD Act. Credit card issuers must now apply any amounts in excess of the minimum monthly payment to balances with the highest interest rates first.      Bourke said the language in the credit card agreement \\"has become a little less important because the products themselves are a little safer. A lot of that old language was masking practices that were difficult to understand and harmful.\\"      Worst contracts haven't gotten much better      CreditCards.com reviewed the 20 most difficult reads and 20 wordiest contracts from July and compared them with contracts for the same cards published by the Fed in the third quarter of 2010. Six of the 20 most difficult-to-read contracts showed improvement; nine of the 20 were rated the same readability level as previous versions -- often because they were the same contract. Only three contracts were worse. Two of the 20 agreements were no longer listed in the Fed's database, an indication that the credit cards were no longer offered by the issuer.      A GTE Federal Credit Union agreement topped the list of the most difficult to read contracts in July. That agreement required 18.5 years of education to understand. The lender swapped that agreement out for another contract that was rated 16.2 years -- a 12 percent improvement, but still very high.      A Compass Bank agreement that ranked fourth on the list of unreadable contracts got a makeover. According to Ed Bilek, senior vice president and director of external communications for BBVA Compass Bank, which owns Compass, it was no accident that the same contract given a 17.5 reading level in the first analysis scored only 12.7 in the follow-up review.      \\"It was deliberate,\\" Bilek said, adding the company began re-tooling its contracts in 2009 after passage of the CARD Act. He acknowledged that the 12.7 grade level rating is \\"still too high\\" and said the bank is continuing its efforts to simplify terms for its customers. The re-writing that began in 2009 continued in 2010 with further tweaking of language.      \\"Part of that was redoing our disclosure in our credit card agreement with the idea in mind that we tried to make it much easier to read and understand,\\" Bilek said. \\"The two traits that we believe should be in every product are transparency and simplicity.\\"      He added: \\"We talk to our customers quite a bit about our products. We ask them, 'You read it. Did you understand it? Is it easy?'\\"      More brevity      There was clear evidence of editing for brevity on several of the wordiest contracts. Among the 20 wordiest agreements from July, three out of four (15 contracts) had been shortened, according to the readability software program.      The average agreement analyzed in July ran 3,771 words. A contract for Fifth Third Bank topped the list of wordiest among the more than 1,200 agreements reviewed in July. The program determined that contract had 20,799 words spread over 19 pages. The updated agreement was more spartan, however. It contained only 14,406 words in 15 pages. Both old and new agreements required 15 years reading level. Note: Because the software program deletes words that are contained in headlines, bulleted lists and subtitles, the actual number of words in the agreement are higher.      For comparison, the original U.S. Constitution contains only 4,018 words. William Shakespeare's shortest play, \\"The Comedy of Errors,\\" has 17,858 words.      ... We tried to make it easier to read and understand. -- Ed Bilek      BBVA Compass Bank spokesman      A GE Money Bank retail credit card for Dick's Sporting Goods stores got a major rewrite. It dropped from 11,000 to about 2,000 words -- and from a college reading level (15 years) to a ninth grade reading level, according to the analysis. Similarly, a BrandsMart department store retail card, also issued by GE Money Bank, underwent a dramatic improvement between the first and second analysis. Previously, the agreement contained more than 11,000 words and required 15 years of education to read. The new version contained 1,900 words written at the ninth grade reading level.      Banking industry representatives say contracts are written the way they are because federal and state banking laws require them to make certain disclosures about the cards. They deny that the agreements are deliberately written to confuse consumers.      Some banks and credit unions, however, do manage to satisfy legal requirements without dense language. In our July analysis, we identified the 10 easiest-to-read contracts. All were from credit unions. They were written at less than a seventh grade level.      Experts say most credit card holders don't bother reading their entire contracts. It's no wonder -- the documents are tough reading even for consumer attorneys and people with advanced degrees. Frank, the responsible-lending group researcher, who has a doctorate degree, said he struggles through some passages in the documents: \\"I have to focus to really understand it.\\"      Lenders are required to send the agreements when new credit card accounts are opened or if a consumer requests a copy of their contract. See how to get your credit card agreement .      Frank said the issue is whether the densely worded fine print in the credit card agreement is fair to consumers.      \\"It's supposed to be an agreement between two parties,\\" he said. \\"If it's too complex for one party to ever read or understand, then is it really an agreement as opposed to something that's imposed on you?\\"      The methodology: How we did it      CreditCards.com copied the list of more than 1,200 credit card agreements posted on the Federal Reserve Board's website. Under the Credit CARD Act of 2009, all U.S. credit card issuers with more than 10,000 credit card accounts must submit their agreements to the Fed every quarter as well as post them on their own company websites and make them available to account holders who request them. The Fed launched the site on May 24, 2010, with the initial list of credit card contracts. The site was updated in October 2010. New contracts were added and some deleted from the list, while others remained unchanged. Every credit card agreement posted on the Fed's website as of May 24, 2010, was evaluated by two readability programs that were purchased from Micro Power & Light Co., a Dallas software development company. The first program prepped the content by deleting special characters, incomplete sentences, tables and any special coding that may have been in the text versions of the files. The second program scored the text using three different well-established readability formulas: the Flesch reading ease, Flesch-Kincaid grade level and FOG (Frequency of Gobbledygook) indexes. Only one of the formulas, the widely used FOG score, was used in determining the best and worst credit card agreements and average reading level of a U.S. credit card agreement. We removed Spanish contracts that were included in the Fed's database. In some instances, credit card issuers included both Spanish and English text in their contracts. We deleted any Spanish text and ran the readability formulas on the remaining English content. Some files posted on the Fed's website were not credit card agreements but rather supplemental materials that often accompany agreements, such as tables listing interest and penalty rates and fees or information about credit card or disability insurance. In some instances, they were credit card applications. Those files were not scored for readability. A small number of contracts were not evaluated for readability because the text versions of the agreements were either empty or did not reflect what was actually in the agreement. Because the computer program that prepped the contracts removed headlines, incomplete sentences and special characters, it also removed words from credit card agreements. Therefore, the total word count reflected in the results is less than the word count derived by putting the contracts into a word processing program. In the second analysis, conducted in October and November 2010, we looked at the worst contracts (the 20 most difficult to read and the 20 wordiest) from the original filings and compared them to agreements for the same card products posted in the second batch of filings to the Fed's website.

(If you don’t want to listen to the hour-long retraction, which is a masterpiece of the form, the transcript is available here.)      Daisey has attempted to defend his actions, using an end-justifies-the-means argument:      What I do is not journalism. The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism. For this reason, I regret that I allowed THIS AMERICAN LIFE to air an excerpt from my monologue. THIS AMERICAN LIFE is essentially a journalistic ­- not a theatrical ­- enterprise, and as such it operates under a different set of rules and expectations. But this is my only regret. I am proud that my work seems to have sparked a growing storm of attention and concern over the often appalling conditions under which many of the high-tech products we love so much are assembled in China.      Kevin Slavin has defended Daisey, too:      His skill in telling the story he told is responsible for the phenomenal amount of media around Chinese factory labor practices. Not the New York Times’ China bureau. Not Bloomberg Businessweek. Show me some reporters who were able to generate the same cultural engagement with the issue, will you? Stories aren’t made out of facts. Storytellers use facts to reveal truth but they use a lot of other things too. And if ever I have to choose between facts and truth, I’ll take truth. It’s always a great story, and stories are the life inside the human mind.      It’s a lot easier to tell a great story if you don’t also need to be factual about things. Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet are fiction; Richard III and Henry V are mostly fiction, albeit based on historical events. And it’s precisely because they’re fictional — because Shakespeare was always storyteller first and foremost — that they’re still performed so regularly, all over the world, and that they have had such powerful emotional resonance with billions of people over the centuries since they were written.      But here’s the thing: Shakespeare never lied. He never sat down in front of thousands of people to tell a first-person story, over and over again, about events which he had simply invented. He never ended that story with an exhortation which would carry no weight if his audience thought the story was fiction:      When Apple would call journalists who had spoken to me, and tell them, “You know, I don’t know if you want to be associated with him. He’s kind of unstable. You know, he does work in the theater.” I would keep my head down. And I would tell my story. And tonight—we know the truth.      At the end of Daisey’s show, every member of the audience is given a sheet of paper with the heading “CHANGE IS POSSIBLE”. It includes Tim Cook’s email address, and urges the audience to, among other things, “think different about upgrading”. And one of the reasons why Daisey’s show has proved so popular — his This American Life episode was the most downloaded in the show’s history, even more than the squirrel cop — is that it combined great storytelling with a feeling that this is happening now and we should do something about it. It’s exactly the same formula used by Kony 2012, a project which is equally problematic.      My friend and Reuters colleague Rebecca Hamilton has written a great book, Fighting for Darfur, which should be required reading for anybody who has been drawn in by the Kony 2012 campaign. Or, for that matter, by Daisey’s monologue. Here’s what she wrote to me:      To build a mass movement quickly, it helps to have an over-simplified, emotive narrative with a single demand. It also helps to tells people that by doing easy tasks – sharing a link on Facebook, buying a bracelet — they can save lives. Central to the formula is that the agency of local actors gets downplayed to hype up the importance of action by outsiders. But all those ingredients inevitably lead to eventual failure when the simple solutions can’t fix the complex reality. The movement walks away, disillusioned. And in the meantime untold resources have been expended on solutions that have been out of step with what local activists need.      The fact is that the chief beneficiary of the success of Daisey’s monologue has been Mike Daisey, much more than any group of factory workers or underground trades unionists in China. Similarly, the chief beneficiary of the success of Kony 2012 has been Invisible Children, a US non-profit which spends its money mostly on making movies.      And this is where the justifications coming from Daisey and Slavin really fall down — in the idea that if you get a lot of westerners riled up about what’s going on in some far-flung part of the world, then that is in and of itself a Good Thing. Daisey has managed to convince himself that his interests are perfectly aligned with those of the workers at Foxconn. Even when he presents himself as some kind of savior in a Hawaiian shirt, bringing wisdom to the workers just by asking the right questions:      I’m just ad-hoc-ing questions, I’m asking the questions you would expect: “What village in China are you from? How long have you been working at Foxconn? What do you do at the plant? How do you find your job? What would you change at Foxconn if you could change anything?” That last question always gets them. They always react like a bee has flown into their faces and then they say something to Cathy and Cathy says, “He says he never thought of that before.” Every time. Every time.      Of course it’s ludicrous to believe that someone working 12-hour shifts at a Foxconn plant wouldn’t start thinking about how the plant might be better run. But that’s the power of theater: its conventions are designed to encourage us to suspend such disbelief. And so we walk away thinking that Mike Daisey is bold and wonderful, and really did ask that question of Foxconn workers under the glare of gun-toting Chinese guards. (Of course, we now know that no Foxconn guards are armed: that bit, too, was made up.) And we think that the Chinese workers are so beaten-down and resigned to their miserable fate that they never even stop to think about how things might be improved.      And this is why I believe the story of Shin In Geun, despite the fact that its format is inherently treacherous. Both Shin and Harden have every incentive to exaggerate and to make things seem worse than they are; what’s more, there’s absolutely no way of fact-checking the vast majority of what’s in the story. But what’s missing from their tale is the white man’s burden: the idea that a white American like Mike Daisey or Jason Russell (or Jeff Sachs, for that matter) is a selfless hero, doing good for the poor and exploited in other continents.      What Daisey should have done is what Dave Eggers did when he wrote What is the What: make no pretense that everything is true, and trust in the power of his storytelling to carry the audience along. Instead, he lied — both to This American Life and to his audience.      I am telling you that I do not speak Mandarin, I do not speak Cantonese, I have only a passing familiarity with Chinese culture and to call what I have a passing familiarity is an insult to Chinese culture—I don’t know fuck-all about Chinese culture. But I do know that in my first two hours of my first day at that gate, I met workers who were fourteen years old, I met workers who were thirteen years old, I met workers who were twelve. Do you really think Apple doesn’t know?      This had a lot of resonance for me, when I first heard it, not least because I understand statistics. In order to meet underage workers who are happy to talk about how old they are within two hours of turning up at a factory gate, there need to be a lot of those workers. Many more than the official numbers suggest. But in fact Daisey did not meet underage workers outside the factory gates. (He still claims that he did, but his translator, who’s a much more reliable source, says that he didn’t. And as Evan Osnos says, that whole episode defies credulity in the first place.)      Daisey’s m.o., it’s now clear, was to go to China, talk to some people, and then write a monologue in which he felt free to incorporate anything he’d read about the plight of workers anywhere in the country, presented as a direct piece of first-person reportage. And there’s a good reason why that’s an underhanded and unethical thing to do, which is that even if Apple did everything Daisey’s asking of them, he could still go to China and return with the exact same monologue. With hindsight, Apple was absolutely right not to engage with Daisey directly, because he created a game they could never win. The only winning move, for them, was not to play.      Jack Shafer, then, is right to come down hard on Daisey. He concludes with this, about fabulists generally:      I have my theory: 1) They lie because they don’t have the time or talent to tell the truth, 2) they lie because think they can get away with it, and 3) they lie because they have no respect for the audience they claim to want to enlighten. That would be an ideal subject for a one-man theatrical performance.      The irony is that this subject has already been explored in a one-man theatrical performance — one by Mike Daisey, no less. Daisey, you won’t be surprised to hear, is gentler on James Frey and JT Leroy than Shafer is on Daisey, blaming in significant part “the demands of personal storytelling” for their sins.      In any case, it’s clear that theatrical events are bad places to look for unvarnished truth. And in the set of “theatrical events” I absolutely include things like TED talks. Many people have asked, of the hilarious TED 2012 autotune remix, whether it’s parody or not. The answer is that it’s not parody at all. Rather, it’s the work of someone who has been entranced by TED’s theater, and who hasn’t yet woken up to realize that statements like “we can change the world if we defy the impossible” are less stirring than they are just plain stupid.      Real life is messy. And as a general rule, the more theatrical the story you hear, and the more it divides the world into goodies vs baddies, the less reliable that story is going to be. I’ll be very interested to read Harden’s book about Shin In Geun, to see how the guards and teachers in the prison camp are portrayed — to see whether they’re monsters or whether they themselves are victims of the North Korean regime. As we know from Primo Levi, prison camps will twist and subvert the ethics of all concerned. And even in this excerpt we can see real moral problems: Shin himself behaves with astonishing heartlessness towards his own parents and brother.      One of the central problems with narrative nonfiction is that the best narratives aren’t messy and complicated, while nonfiction nearly always is. Daisey stepped way too far over the line when he started outright lying to his audience and to the producers of This American Life. But all of us in the narrative-nonfiction business (I’ve written such stuff myself) are faced at some point with a choice between telling the story and telling the whole truth, or the whole truth as best we understand it. Someone like Michael Lewis will concentrate with a laser focus on the story: what he writes is the truth, but it isn’t the whole truth. And when you have a storyteller like Mike Daisey who considers himself a monologist rather than a journalist, even outright lies can find their way in to the story very easily.      Ira Glass says that This American Life should have scrapped the idea of doing a Mike Daisey show the minute he told their fact-checkers that he had no way of contacting his translator. But maybe the mistake was made even earlier, when This American Life decided that a theatrical monologue could ever be held to standards of journalistic accuracy. This one certainly couldn’t, and in that I think it’s more the rule than the exception. ||||| Summary:","output":"This article talks about how credit card agreements are still too difficult for most people to read and understand.

Information:  - An urban park/metropolitan park, also known as a municipal park (North America) or a public park, public open space, or municipal gardens (United Kingdom), is a park in cities and other incorporated places to offer recreation and green space to residents of, and visitors to, the municipality. The design, operation and maintenance is usually done by government, typically on the local level, but may occasionally be contracted out to a private sector company.  - The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A) was an American railroad of central Maryland and Washington, D.C., built in the 19th and 20th century. The WB&A absorbed two older railroads, the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad and the Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line, and added its own electric streetcar line between Baltimore and Washington. It was built by a group of Cleveland, Ohio, electric railway entrepreneurs to serve as a high-speed, showpiece line using the most advanced technology of the time. It served Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis, Maryland, for 27 years before the Great Depression and the rise of the automobile forced an end to passenger service in 1935. Only the Baltimore & Annapolis portion continued to operate. Today, parts of the right-of-way are used for light rail, rail trails and roads.  - The Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad was an American railroad of central Maryland built in the 19th century. The railroad, the second to serve Annapolis, ran between Annapolis and Clifford along the north shore of the Severn River. From Clifford, just north of the present day Patapsco Light Rail Stop, it connected with the B&O's Curtis Bay branch so that trains could travel to Baltimore. In 1921, when it was called the Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line, it was purchased by the larger Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A), and then emerged from the WB&A's 1935 bankruptcy and closure as the Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad. B&A electric passenger operation between the two cities continued until 1950, at which time the rail line became solely a freight carrier, operating buses for passenger service. Freight service to Annapolis continued until June 1968 when the Severn River Trestle was declared unsafe. In the 1980s the line was completely shut down. The right-of-way now serves as part of Baltimore's light rail system and as the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail.  - The Jones Falls is a stream in Maryland. It is impounded to create Lake Roland before running through the city of Baltimore and finally emptying into the Baltimore Inner Harbor.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east.

The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - The Woodberry Light Rail Stop is one of 33 stops on the Baltimore Light Rail , USA . The stop is located at the corner or Union and Clipper Avenues in Baltimore , near the areas of Clipper Mill and Television Hill . Also nearby are Druid Hill Park and Hampden . The station is served by Bus Route 22 , which operates nearby . Riders transferring between this bus and the light rail must walk a few blocks . But the Hampden Shuttle stops and lays over at the station 's platform . There is no commuter parking at the station . Woodberry station is in close proximity of the site of a non-light rail station which was owned by the Northern Central Railway , an affiliate of the Pennsylvania Railroad .  - Fairmount Park is the largest municipal park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the historic name for a group of parks located throughout the city. Fairmount Park consists of two park sections named East Park and West Park, divided by the Schuylkill River, with the two sections together totalling . Management of Fairmount Park and the entire citywide park system is overseen by Philadelphia Parks & Recreation, a city department created in 2010 from the merger of the Fairmount Park Commission and the Department of Recreation.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Druid Hill Park is a urban park in northwest Baltimore, Maryland. Its boundaries are marked by Druid Park Drive (north), Swann Drive and Reisterstown Road (west and south), and the Jones Falls Expressway (east). Inaugurated in 1860, Druid Hill Park, a famed urban park, ranks with Central Park (begun in 1858) in New York City and Fairmount Park (1812) in Philadelphia as the oldest landscaped public parks in the United States.  - Light rail, light rail transit (LRT) or fast tram is urban public transport using rolling stock similar to a tramway, but operating at a higher capacity, and often on an exclusive right-of-way.  - The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture. The system has many connections to other transit agencies of Central Maryland, Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and south-central Pennsylvania (Hanover, Harrisburg, and York): WMATA, Charm City Circulator, Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland, Annapolis Transit, Rabbit Transit, Ride-On, and TransIT.  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

It is operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA Maryland). In downtown Baltimore, it uses city streets. Outside the central portions of the city, the line is built on private rights-of-way, mostly from the defunct Northern Central Railway, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad and Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. The line is sometimes referred to the \\"Blue Line\\", or less commonly as the \\"Central Light Rail Line\\", even though the line carries three different routes on the same system: Hunt Valley-BWI (Blue), Hunt Valley-Cromwell (Yellow), and Penn Station-Camden Yards (Red).   - The Northern Central Railway (NCRY) was a Class I Railroad connecting Baltimore, Maryland with Sunbury, Pennsylvania, along the Susquehanna River. Completed in 1858, the line came under the control of the later Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1861, when the PRR acquired a controlling interest in the Northern Central's stock to compete with the rival Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). For eleven decades the Northern Central operated as a subsidiary of the PRR until much of its Maryland trackage was washed out by Hurricane Agnes in 1972; after which most of its operations ceased as the Penn Central declined to repair sections. It is now a fallen flag railway, having come under the control of the later Penn Central (merger of the PRR and the New York Central), Conrail, and then broken apart and disestablished. The southern part in Pennsylvania is now the York County Heritage Rail Trail which connects to a similar hike/bike trail in Northern Maryland down to Baltimore, named the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail. Only the trackage around Baltimore remains in rail service.  - Central Park is an urban park in Manhattan, New York City.

(CNN)  -- Susan Denise Atkins, a former member of the Manson family who killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate during a two-day killing spree in 1969, has died, according to a California corrections spokesman. She was 61. Susan Atkins, here with husband James Whitehouse, died Thursday night after a battle with brain cancer. Atkins died at 11:46 p.m. PT Thursday (2:46 a.m. Friday ET) at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, said Terry Thornton with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins, California's longest-serving female inmate, was suffering from terminal brain cancer. Since she entered prison in 1971, she became a born-again Christian who worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children, among others, according to a Web site maintained by her attorney and husband, James Whitehouse. But Atkins was best known for her actions in 1969 when as a 21-year-old she and other Manson family members participated in seven murders over two days, a rampage that terrorized Los Angeles. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate, who was the eight months' pregnant, down as the 26-year-old actress pleaded for mercy, stabbing her 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \\"asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\\" After stabbing Tate to death, Atkins -- known in the family as Sadie Mae Glutz -- scrawled the word \\"pig\\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski, according to historical accounts of the murders. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's houseguests -- Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring and Voytek Frykowski -- were killed. Also slain was teenager Steven Parent, who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back. All of those involved -- Manson, Atkins, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson -- were convicted in connection with the five deaths that night and the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. They were all sentenced to death. But their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972. Atkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, 2008, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7. In July 2008, Atkins requested a \\"compassionate release\\" from the California Board of Parole Hearings. It was denied by unanimous decision. Her request was opposed by Tate's sister, Debra, Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. On September 2, a panel from the Board of Parole Hearings denied Atkins' suitability for parole in a hearing, her 13th. Atkins' hospital bed was wheeled into the hearing room for the proceeding, and she appeared to sleep through much of it. For her statement, her husband helped her deliver the 23rd Psalm. She spoke in a high, cracked voice. During the roughly six-hour-long hearing, Debra Tate asked the board commissioners not to free Atkins. \\"There has never been any hate in my heart for these people,\\" she said. \\"I am incapable of hating. I commend them -- always have commended them -- for their good deeds that they have managed to accomplish within the walls of confinement. However, I do believe that the death of my sister, my nephew -- which would be turning 40 years old right now, this week -- is not an irrelevant cause.\\" Atkins was described as a model prisoner who accepted responsibility for her crime, but Tate said Atkins had never offered her an apology. Sebring's nephew, Anthony DiMaria, also spoke at the parole suitability hearing. \\"I feel genuine compassion for Ms. Atkins as she deals with this disease,\\" he told parole commissioners, \\"but in no way should an illness dealt by fate mitigate punishment for crimes of this magnitude.\\" Atkins was housed in the California Institution for Women at Frontera until May 2008 when her declining health prompted a move to Central California Women's Facility. On his Web site, Whitehouse wrote that as of spring 2009, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair. Like most of the other former Manson family members, Atkins shunned Manson during her incarceration. \\"He is a liar, a con artist, a physical abuser of women and children, a psychological and emotional abuser of human beings, a thief, a dope pusher, a kidnaper, a child stealer, a pimp, a rapist and a child molester,\\" she wrote in a manuscript posted on her Web site. \\"I can attest to all of these things with my own eyes. And he was all of these things before he was a murderer.\\" Atkins gave birth to a son while living at Spahn Ranch, an old movie set, with other members of the Manson family. While she was on death row, she wrote, he was legally taken from her because no one in her family was willing to raise him. \\"His name and identity have been changed and sealed, so I have no idea where he is or how he is doing,\\" she wrote. \\"I have since been told his name was changed to Paul, and whether or not that is true I like it. ... My continuing separation from my son, even after all these years, remains an incredibly poignant and enduring loss.\\" Ironically, Sharon Tate planned to name her unborn son Paul. The gravestone bears the inscription Paul Richard Polanski.

Possible answers: felt angry, felt happy, felt cold A:","output":"Considering the context provided, it can be inferred that Kai would most likely feel happy after walking back from school and enjoying his freedom and the warm spring air. Here's a detailed analysis of the situation and the reasons for each of the emotions: 1. Kai's feeling of freedom: The fact that Kai is walking back from school suggests that he is glad to have finished his classes or education-related responsibilities for the day. This feeling of relief from the academic pressures and routine can be a significant contributing factor to his happiness. The freedom to enjoy the rest of the day on his own terms can be a liberating emotion, leading to a sense of satisfaction and joy. 2. The warm spring air: The setting plays an essential part in gauging Kai's emotions, as the warm spring air is generally perceived as pleasant and enjoyable. The spring season, with its mild temperatures, is welcoming and represents new beginnings, personal growth, and rejuvenation. Being surrounded by nature's beauty during this season can instill a sense of calm and happiness in most individuals, making it likely that Kai feels happy in this situation. 3. Physical activity and its impact on mood: Walking is known to release endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. It's possible that the physical activity of walking back from school can contribute positively to Kai's emotional well-being and happiness. However, to provide a thorough analysis, let's consider the other possible emotional outcomes: Felt angry - It's unlikely that Kai would feel angry in this situation, as everything mentioned seems to be positive and enjoyable. The freedom, warm spring air, and physical activity all contribute to a positive mood rather than inciting anger. Felt cold - Although the context suggests that it's spring and the air is warm, it is still possible to feel a bit chilly in the shade or when the wind picks up. However, since you mentioned that Kai is enjoying the warm spring air, it is safe to assume Kai is feeling comfortable in the prevalent weather conditions. Based on the information provided and the reasons outlined above, it can be concluded that Kai most likely felt happy as he walked back from school, enjoying his freedom and the warm spring air."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.  Question: \\"What kept the U.S. government from being able to stop  Bin Laden's flow of money?\\" Answer: \\"They couldn't find any information\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer \\"They couldn't find any information\\" is not entirely correct. A more accurate and detailed answer would be as follows: The U.S. government faced multiple challenges in stopping Bin Laden's flow of money. First of all, they discovered that Bin Laden was not personally funding al-Qaeda, which forced them to reevaluate their approach and focus on other sources of funding such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. However, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions amidst the vast sums moving in the international financial system, making it hard for the CIA to find or disrupt their money flows. The suggested creation of an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center could not gain necessary resources from the Treasury and CIA. Domestically, while the FBI had knowledge about extremist organizations connected to al-Qaeda operating within the United States, they failed to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda's fundraising. Additionally, Treasury regulators and U.S. financial institutions focused predominantly on money laundering related to drug trafficking and high-level international fraud, considering terrorist financing to be of lower importance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years later.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a great director at the helm","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"a great director at the helm,\\" can be considered positive. This is due to several components within the sentence that contribute to building a favorable impression. Firstly, the word \\"great\\" serves as a strong, affirmative descriptor that positively evaluates the director. The adjective conveys excellence, skill, and effectiveness in the director's work or abilities. It signifies that the person holds an outstanding position in their field, surpassing average or mediocre levels of performance. Secondly, the inclusive phrase \\"at the helm\\" speaks to the director's leading role in any creative endeavor or project. This implies that the director has a significant amount of responsibility and authority in their occupation. So, the positive regard for the director can influence the overall perception of the project or team under their leadership. Using this expression also shows trust and confidence placed in the director's judgment and decision-making abilities during the project or creative endeavor. Thus, from the choice of adjective and the overall message the sentence conveys, it is clear that the sentiment leans heavily toward the positive end of the spectrum. Followers of the director's work, or those intrigued by any projects helmed by the described director, would most likely feel reassured and optimistic knowing that there is a skilled and capable individual leading the way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name \\"England\\". The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global \\"lingua franca\\". Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch.  - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .  - Karl Julius Ploetz ( 8 July 1819 -- 6 February 1881 ) was a German author of scholarly works , most notably his Epitome of History published in the English language in 1883 . Ploetz was born in Berlin . He is credited with the idea of arranging historic data by dates , geographic location , and other factors . As later used in the English language , Encyclopedia of World History credited with being one of the most complete and comprehensive academic tools available before the electronic revolution . His work was a compilation of factual world events designed to help the students and the general reader . The first English translation was in the U.S. in 1883 by William H. Tillinghast and published by Houghton Mifflin Company . The name of the original work ( in a form of a handbook ) was Auszug aus der alten , mittleren und neueren Geschichte . Karl Ploetz died in Görlitz in 1881 .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west.

The Frisian languages is the closest living language group to English languages, and are together grouped into the Anglo-Frisian languages. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to foreign influences. The three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch, Danish, and/or Low German, depending upon their location. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the Great Yarmouth area, Friesland, and Denmark are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how do electric stoves boil water?\\" is \\"burning\\", given that  electric stoves boil water?","output":"No, I do not think that the right answer to the question \\"how do electric stoves boil water?\\" is \\"burning.\\" Electric stoves work on a different principle than traditional gas stoves, which may involve an open flame. To better understand how electric stoves boil water, let's explore how they function and the processes involved in boiling water. Electric stoves work by converting electrical energy into heat energy. They typically consist of coiled heating elements made of a resistance wire enclosed in an insulating sheath, usually covered by a glass-ceramic surface. When an electric current passes through the resistance wire, it encounters resistance, which results in the production of heat. As a result, the energy provided through the electrical outlet is converted into heat energy that heats the coil. When you place a pot or kettle with water on the electric stove, the heat generated by the heating element is transferred to the pot, and then to the water inside the pot. As the water absorbs the heat, its temperature rises. At a certain point, the water molecules acquire enough energy to break free from the attractive forces holding them together in the liquid state. This transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase is what we call boiling. On the other hand, the term \\"burning\\" typically implies an exothermic reaction involving the rapid combination of a substance with oxygen, producing heat, light, and often flames. It usually refers to a process called combustion. For example, when wood or coal is burned, the carbon-based compounds combine with oxygen to create carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of heat and light. In conclusion, describing the method by which electric stoves boil water as \\"burning\\" is not accurate. Instead, electric stoves rely on resistance heating to generate the necessary heat for boiling water. To properly answer the question: An electric stove boils water by using electrical energy to generate heat through a resistance heating element, transferring the heat to the pot, and ultimately increasing the temperature of the water until it reaches the boiling point and begins to evaporate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Hundred Years' War, the army of the Duke of Burgundy and a force of about two hundred English soldiers occupied Paris from May 1420 until 1436. They repelled an attempt by Joan of Arc to liberate the city in 1429. A century later, during the French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League. On 24 August 1572, Paris was the site of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, when thousands of French Protestants were killed. The last of these wars, the eighth one, ended in 1594, after Henri IV had converted to Catholicism and was finally able to enter Paris as he supposedly declared Paris vaut bien une messe (\\"Paris is well worth a Mass\\"). The city had been neglected for decades; by the time of his assassination in 1610, Henry IV had rebuilt the Pont Neuf, the first Paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings, linked with a new wing the Louvre to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges.

Answer:","output":"In \\"The Planets Suite\\" by Gustav Holst, the planet that is often referred to as the \\"bringer of jollity\\" is Jupiter. Officially titled \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity,\\" this is the fourth movement of Holst's renowned seven-movement orchestral suite, which was written between 1914 and 1916. Each movement of the suite is characterized by the composer's interpretation of what he believed to be the astrological and mythological associations with the seven planets in our solar system at the time (excluding Earth and Pluto, the latter of which was not yet discovered). The 'Planets Suite' explores the influence of these celestial bodies on the human psyche and each movement reflects the planet's astrological character, as understood by the composer. \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" represents the jovial, expansive nature of the planet and its Roman mythological counterpart, Jupiter – the king of the gods and the god of the sky. As the bringer of jollity, Holst's Jupiter is characterized by an exuberance of life, warmth, and good cheer. The piece features a robust, rhythmic energy that showcases an expansive and ambitious melody, reflecting jovial themes of optimism and ebullience. The movement is composed of a series of rhythmic patterns and thematic materials that are developed throughout, creating a sense of vitality and enthusiasm. One of the most famous sections of \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" is the central portion, often referred to as the \\"big tune\\" or the \\"Jupiter Hymn.\\" This noble, majestic melody is evocative of British patriotism and has been described as representing a sense of pride and unity. This melody later became the basis of the British patriotic hymn \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country,\\" with lyrics written by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice in 1921. Overall, \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" is a spirited, uplifting, and splendid piece that captures the essence of joy and conviviality often associated with its eponymous planet and Roman deity. This movement has garnered widespread acclaim since its premiere and is regarded as one of the most iconic and popular works in Holst's \\"The Planets Suite.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. What makes you happy, and what does not? The best way to figure that out is to track your daily activities. Keep track of everything you do during the day. You might also want to note when and how long you did it--as playing video games online for 30 minutes may have a very different effect if it is a four hour session.  You might write things like “rode my bike to work” or “watched Netflix”. Find a system that works for you. You could keep a small notebook with you or use the Memo or Notepad function on your phone to log activities. At the end of each day, look back over your activity log. Using a scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, rate each activity depending on how it made you feel. “10” might indicate “very depressed” while “1” could mean “feeling really happy”.  For example, maybe you missed your bus and had to walk home in the rain. You might rate that as a high number on your scale. Maybe you had a nice talk on the phone with your mom. That might earn a low score on your scale. Keep in mind that it is important to be objective and stick with a specific type of rating system since people tend to magnify their symptoms when they are depressed. You may find surprises. For instance, you might figure out you really do feel better after walking after dinner--even though you keep stating you hate exercise. Or, conversely, you keep saying you like hanging out with Tamara but every time you have lunch together you feel worse afterwards. Spend a week or 2 tracking your activities and rating your depression. Then spend some time looking back over your logs. Notice whether there are certain activities that consistently rate really low on your scale. Then make sure to regularly spend time doing those activities. Maybe “reading for pleasure” always rates as a 1 in your log. Make it a point to allow yourself some time to enjoy that activity each day. It doesn’t have to be a lot of time. Just set aside 30 minutes before bed and take that time to enjoy yourself. Depression leads to feeling overwhelmed, and can interfere with planning or prioritizing--which causes more havoc and a depression spiral.  Having a clear list can help battle these problems.   Use your activity tracking to help you. For example, if you know you have a stressful meeting on Monday, make sure to schedule some extra time for something you enjoy, such as reading a new novel that you're interested in. Knowing that you’ll be able to unwind might make getting through the meeting easier. Make sure the \\"to-do\\" list is realistic. Too many things on your list can end up being counter-productive. Instead of focused, you may get overwhelmed and not do anything or feel bad that it was not completed. Depression can also make it difficult or impossible to complete tasks. Depression is a real disease, not just \\"feeling sad,\\" and exhaustion, aches, pains, and more are real symptoms. Getting out of bed and taking a shower may be accomplishment enough on some days, never mind cleaning the oven or returning an email. Do not treat the to-do list as something that trumps your need for honoring physical symptoms. Prioritize self-care. A common error in to-do lists is not prioritizing your emotional needs--not just work, school, home maintenance, or the errands. Doing things that make you feel good and take care of yourself is just as important--sometimes more so. Putting time aside to play with your cat, take a walk, pray, speak to a friend, or draw can make it so you can tackle the other things. Once you’ve started to understand what triggers your depression and what makes it better, you can start challenging yourself to make some positive changes. Figure out what would make you feel better and set some goals to make that happen.  Make sure each goal is specific. For example, instead of saying “I want to eat healthier,” try saying, “I will eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day and I will cut out fried foods. Create attainable goals.

We have this equation: -927*h + 115308 + 117189 = -7848*h + 4104 First, let's find out how many h's we have. We'll do this by adding 927*h to both sides to cancel out the -927*h on the left side: (-927*h + 927*h) + 115308 + 117189 = -7848*h + 927*h + 4104 This simplifies to: 115308 + 117189 = -6921*h + 4104 (because -7848*h + 927*h = -6921*h) Now, let's combine the numbers on the left side by adding them: 232497 = -6921*h + 4104 (because 115308 + 117189 = 232497) Next, we need to get rid of that 4104 on the right side. Let's subtract 4104 from both sides: 232497 - 4104 = -6921*h This simplifies to: 228393 = -6921*h (because 232497 - 4104 = 228393) Now, we need to find the value of h. To do that, let's divide both sides by -6921: 228393 / -6921 = h When we do the division, we find out that: h = -33 There you go, buddy!

Lying really does create a desire to clean the \\"dirty\\" body part, according to a study by University of Michigan. \\"The references to 'dirty hands' or 'dirty mouths' in everyday language suggest that people think about abstract issues of moral purity in terms of more experiences with physical purity,\\" said Spike W.S. Lee, a U-M doctoral candidate, who conducted the study with Norbert Schwarz, a psychologist at the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR), the Ross School of Business, and the U-M psychology department. For the study, Lee and Schwarz asked 87 students to play the role of lawyers competing with a colleague, \\"Chris\\", for a promotion. Each was asked to imagine they found an important document that Chris had lost, and that returning the document would help his career and hurt their own career. Each participant was instructed to leave Chris a message by either voice mail or email, telling him who they were and either lying that they could not find his document or telling the truth that they had found the document. Next, participants rated the desirability of several products as part of a supposed marketing survey and reported how much they were willing to pay for each product. The products included mouthwash  and hand sanitizer . Study participants who lied on the phone, leaving an untrue and mean voicemail, felt a stronger desire for mouthwash and were willing to pay more for it than those who lied on e-mail. And conversely, those who lied on e-mail, typing the same mean message, felt a stronger desire for hand sanitizer and were willing to pay more for _ . Saying nice and morally correct things, on the other hand, made it less appealing to clean the body part involved in conveying the message. In scientific terms, the findings showed that the embodiment  of moral purity is specific to the modality involved in the moral misbehavior.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: eagles are being trained to take down drones from the sky","output":"The most important words in the given sentence are \\"eagles,\\" \\"trained,\\" \\"take down,\\" \\"drones,\\" and \\"sky.\\" Here's an analysis of why each of these words plays a crucial role in conveying the meaning of the sentence: 1. Eagles: This word is significant because it specifies the type of animals being trained. Eagles are known for their exceptional strength, sharp vision, and incredible hunting capabilities, making them suitable for the task mentioned in the sentence. 2. Trained: The word \\"trained\\" denotes that the eagles are being prepared for a specific purpose. It indicates a process and implies that these birds have been, or are being, taught the necessary skills to achieve that purpose. This term establishes the distinction between eagles found in nature and the ones involved in the task mentioned here. 3. Take down: This phrase is vital because it defines the objective of the training program. \\"Take down\\" is an action phrase describing the ultimate goal of the training, which is for the eagles to be able to remove or neutralize the drones. 4. Drones: \\"Drones\\" is an essential word in this sentence because it identifies the target of the eagles' training. Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that serve several purposes, and their usage has increased in recent years. This term highlights the nature of the threat or challenge that the eagles are being trained to deal with. 5. Sky: The word \\"sky\\" is crucial because it establishes the context for the action. \\"Sky\\" indicates where the eagles will be performing their task, so it's relevant to both the setting of the activity and to concepts related to aerial surveillance and drone usage. In summary, the words \\"eagles,\\" \\"trained,\\" \\"take down,\\" \\"drones,\\" and \\"sky\\" are critical in this sentence as they collaboratively communicate the main idea: that eagles are being prepared to neutralize or remove drones from the sky, an action that likely has significant implications in terms of security, safety, and environmental concerns."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are so many self tanning products out there, it can be difficult to choose one that will work for you. Some formulas allow you to build a tan gradually over the course of a few days or a week, while others immediately stain your skin bronze. Some are long-lasting, while others wear off after a week or wash off at the end of the day. Figure out which product is best for your needs:   Gradual self-tanning formulas. These come in the form of creams, gels, sprays or foams. Gradual self-tanning formulas usually contain either dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and Erythrulose, both of which work by reacting with the amino acids on the skin surface to create a darker complexion. One application will darken the skin by just a shade or so, but you can keep applying the product over the course of several days to achieve the color you want.  Instant tanning formulas. Most instant tanners are sprays that you can apply immediately for a sun-kissed look. Some stay in place for about a week, while others can be washed away at the end of the day. Instant formulas are trickier to apply than gradual formulas, since they stain the skin right away and might leave streaks.  Face tanning formulas. Look for a self-tanner designed for use on the face if yours is on the sensitive or oily side. While most self-tanners work on the body and the face equally well, you'll want to get one specifically for the face if your skin is a little finicky.  Pick the right color. If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium color. If you have olive skin, choose a dark formula. You can always reapply the self-tanner to deepen your tan if your first application looks too light. Thick hair can get in the way of self-tanner when you're trying to apply it evenly. You might want to shave or wax your legs (and arms, if necessary) to ensure you'll be happy with the final appearance of your tan.  If you have fine hair on your legs or arms, there's no need to remove it before tanning unless you want to. Guys might also want to shave or wax the chest or back before applying self tanner. No matter what your skin type, is, it's best to exfoliate well in the shower before tanning. When your skin has dry, flaky patches, it's a lot harder to apply self-tanner evenly, and you'll end up with a patchy look instead of a pretty finish.  The chemicals in self tanner react with amino acids in the upper layers of your skin. By removing the uppermost layer (which would've sloughed off on its own soon anyway) you're ensuring that the tan develops in a fresh layer that's going to be around longer. Also, dry skin tends to absorb more color, increasing the likelihood of an uneven tan. To exfoliate, use a washcloth, a scrub brush or scrub gel to thoroughly exfoliate all of the areas you're tanning.  Focus on rough spots like your elbows and knees. The self-tanner tends to darken these areas more than other parts of your body, since it soaks in faster. Rough skin will cause the application to look even more uneven. Moisturize the skin after exfoliating, particularly if your skin is dry. Pay attention to areas like the knees and elbows where tan can build up. Use lotion or oil to trap the moisture in your skin after your shower. Allow it to fully absorb into your skin over an hour or so before you apply the self-tanner. It's important that while you're applying the self tanner, your skin is completely dry. If you're going to be in the bathroom, wait for any humidity from the bath or shower to subside. Make sure it's cool enough wherever you are so that you don't sweat for the next few hours. A rushed self-tanning job is immediately obvious. You'll miss some spots, have streaky areas or stain your clothes and hands. Do yourself a favor and set aside several hours so you can make sure you have enough time to thoroughly and evenly cover each area you're planning to tan.","output":"This article discusses various self-tanning product options, including gradual, instant, and face tanning formulas, and provides detailed steps on choosing the right color, preparing the skin through exfoliation and moisturizing, and applying the tanner for an even and long-lasting tan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – The family of a Florida man who was shot and killed in his garage by a police deputy has been awarded just 4 in damages, reports CBS. Gregory Hill was playing music in his garage on an afternoon in 2014 when a neighbor called the police to complain, the New York Times reports. Deputy Christopher Newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old Hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his Fort Pierce home. The police said Hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded Hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door (which had been opened for the deputies) was closed again and Newman shot at Hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of Hill’s three children. Last week, a federal jury delivered a verdict that baffled them. It found Newman had not used excessive force, but that St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara had been negligent (due to Newman's actions)—but only minimally so. Specifically, the sheriff's office was found to be just 1% at fault for Hill's death, so the damages (1 for funeral expenses and 1 for each child’s suffering) were reduced to 4 cents from 4. The family's lawyer says, due to Hill's intoxication, the judge will further reduce the award from 4 cents to nothing. “I don’t get it,” the family's lawyer tells the Times. \\"I think [the jurors] were trying to insult the case.

These two people were called lawmakers, which means the people in their town chose them to make rules and help the town stay safe and happy. Even though these lawmakers were supposed to be really good at following the rules they made, they made a big mistake. They didn't tell the truth about something very important. They secretly had a special friendship with each other, which wasn't allowed because they had promised to be best friends with someone else. It's like having a best friend and then deciding to have another best friend and not telling the first best friend.  What they did was wrong, but what happened next was even worse. Instead of saying sorry and telling everyone what they did, they tried to hide it. They came up with a plan to lie and trick everyone in the town, which is not what good lawmakers are supposed to do. Luckily, some people figured out what they were doing and decided to catch them. So, they told everyone what had happened, and the lawmakers had to say they were sorry. But because they didn't follow the rules, a big group of important people special called \\"House of Representatives\\" thought about a big punishment for them. These people thought that maybe they shouldn't be lawmakers anymore. This is called being \\"recommended for removal,\\" which means they might have to stop being lawmakers and let someone else try to do a better job. It teaches them a lesson that if they want to be in charge of making rules, they have to follow the rules, too.

However, they are experiencing a technical problem with Slideshare, as it isn't importing their presentation.

The length of time they mention (an hour) further emphasizes their annoyance - this implies that they perceive the length of the wait time for the import as excessive. They probably expected the import process to be a relatively quick or at least a smooth one, and this expectation not being met has resulted in a negative sentiment. This might be considered a complaint or critique about Slideshare's user experience or performance.

Snow White -- starring Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth -- debuted to a solid but not spectacular 39.3 million internationally from 45 markets, and it will need svelte legs both at home and abroad to make back its 170 million production budget and hefty marketing spend. It has yet to a debut in a number of key foreign territories, including Russia and Australia.      The film's undeniable domestic strength is a needed win for Universal after box-office stumbles Battleship and The Five-Year Engagement. It's also the first of the recent fairy tale retellings to strike a chord with moviegoers, and a sequel is already in active development.      \\"From the get-go, the filmmakers, the cast and the studio conveyed how very unique this movie was and that its appeal would go beyond the usual Snow White audience,\\" Universal president of domestic distribution Nikki Rocco said.      Snow White was directed by Rupert Sanders and produced by Joe Roth.      PHOTOS: 'Snow White and the Huntsman' Starring Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth      It wasn't the only new Hollywood event pic making headlines. Opening in 15 markets overseas a week ahead of its June 8 domestic debut, Ridley Scott's 3D sci-fi spectacle Prometheus grossed a stellar 35 million for 20th Century Fox.      Prometheus -- also starring Theron, as well as Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender -- handily beat Snow White in the U.K. (10 million versus 5 million), the only market where the two movies went up against each other. The top territory for Prometheus was Russia with 11.1 million.      Prometheus is performing especially well for an R-rated pic (in the U.K., it has the equivalent of a 15 rating).      Snow White opened higher overseas than The Hunger Games (38.7 million) and the first Twilight (30 million). Snow White opened No. 1 in 30 of the markets and generated strong returns in Latin America and Asia, including placing No. 1 in Mexico with 4.4 million. The U.K. was the film's highest-grossing market.      VIDEO: 'Snow White and the Huntsman': Colleen Atwood on Creating the Fairy Tale Costumes      Universal's marketing operation is being praised by rival studios for succeeding in piquing the interest of males on the eve of Snow White's opening. The action-packed film needed both sexes to succeed and was never designed to appeal only to femmes. Exit polling revealed that females made up 53 percent of the opening weekend audience in North America, while males made up 47 percent.      Snow White did skew older, with 56 percent of the audience over the age of 25 and 52 percent over the age of 30. The film's B CinemaScore didn't appear to slow down the film, which was up on Saturday.

The Andy Garcia-Eva Longoria starrer placed 10th with an estimated 1.8 million from 757 theaters.      At the specialty box office, Fox Searchlight's The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Focus Features' Moonrise Kingdom both continued to turn in strong performances, along with French blockbuster comedy The Intouchables, distributed by the Weinstein Co.      The new offering at the specialty box office was Dimension Films' Piranha 3DD, which the Weinstein Co. released under its Radius TWC banner, meaning the pic opened simultaneously in theaters and on premium VOD. The Weinstein Co. had muted theatrical expectations for the film, which grossed 179,000 from 86 theaters for a location average of 7,004. Early numbers suggest it is doing good business on VOD.      Exotic Marigold Hotel grossed 4.6 million domestically from 1,294 theaters for a cume of 25.5 million. The feel-good pic, which has earned north of 107 million worldwide, placed No. 6 domestically.      In its second weekend, Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom grossed 848,681 from 16 theaters for an impressive per-location average of 53,043 and cume of 1.7 million.      Intouchables grossed 350,186 from 50 theaters in its second outing for a location average of 7,004 and cume of 516,798. ||||| \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" easily made it out of the woods at the box office this weekend, as the film's debut far exceeded industry projections.            The fairy-tale adaptation opened with a surprisingly robust 56.3 million, according to an estimate from distributor Universal Pictures — about 10 million more than pre-release audience surveys had indicated the film would bring in on its first weekend in release.            That meant that of the two films based on \\"Snow White\\" to hit theaters this year, \\"Huntsman\\" was the fairest of them all. Back in March, Relativity Media's bouncier family version \\"Mirror Mirror,\\" starring Julia Roberts and Lily Collins, debuted with a weak 18 million and collected 62 million by the end of its run.            \\"Snow White and the Huntsman,\\" featuring \\"Twilight\\"star Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron, has a darker tone than \\"Mirror Mirror.\\" Universal also spent much more to produce \\"Snow White\\" — about 170 million, compared with a 100-million budget for the Relativity film.            The movie's respectable opening is welcome positive news for Universal, which is coming off the disastrous box-office performance of its 209-million production \\"Battleship.\\" Behind the Navy action flick, \\"Snow White\\" is the most expensive movie the studio is releasing in 2012 and part of a strategy to spend more on films that will appeal to a global audience.            Those who saw \\"Snow White\\" in the U.S. this weekend gave the film an average grade of B, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Roughly 52% of the movie's audience was over the age of 30, which could bode well for Stewart's career. Before \\"Snow White,\\" the actress had yet to appear in any major film outside of the massively popular \\"Twilight\\" series. With the vampire franchise coming to a close this fall, \\"Snow White\\" is the first indication that the 22-year-old has appeal outside of the young female \\"Twilight\\" fan base.            Overseas, \\"Snow White\\" debuted in 45 foreign countries and sold 39.3 million worth of tickets. It had the strongest debut in the United Kingdom, where the picture grossed 5.5 million, and also did well in Spain and Mexico.            Although the film performed solidly abroad, it didn't do as well as Ridley Scott's \\"Prometheus,\\" the sci-fi movie which hits U.S. theaters next weekend. Playing in 15 foreign markets, the 3-D film collected 35 million and was No. 1 in 14 countries. The movie, which stars an ensemble cast including Theron, Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, sold the most tickets in Russia — 11.1 million. Next weekend, the picture will open in 35 additional international locations, including Australia and Taiwan.            Meanwhile, \\"The Avengers\\" passed the final installment of \\"Harry Potter\\" to become the third-highest-grossing film of all time, not adjusting for inflation. With its 1.4-billion worldwide sum, the picture has now only made less than James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" and \\"Titanic.\\"            A smaller film, however, didn't have as much success at the box office this weekend. The Weinstein Co.'s garish horror sequel \\"Piranha 3DD\\" debuted in 86 cinemas this weekend and grossed a dismal 179,000. Those opening-weekend figures indicate the film won't come near to making the 83 million\\"Piranha 3D\\" grossed worldwide in 2010.      [Updated, 11:48 a.m. June 3: \\"Men in Black 3\\" had a solid second weekend in theaters, with its ticket sales dropping 46% to 29.3 million. But the movie is performing far better overseas, where the third installment in the sci-fi comedy franchise has already raked in over 275 million. Moviegoers in China and Russia — where 3-D and special effects are especially popular — are so far most interested in seeing the picture abroad.

(Reuters) - \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" broke the spell of lackluster performances by many big-budget films this summer season at movie theaters, grabbing 56.3 million in its first weekend to top \\"Men in Black 3,\\" according to studio estimates on Sunday.      The film, a dark and sometimes violent take on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, collected an additional 39.3 million in 45 international markets where it also opened this weekend.      The solid debut led Universal Pictures' \\"Snow White\\" to escape the fate of \\"Battleship,\\" also distributed by Universal, and Warner Bros' vampire film \\"Dark Shadows,\\" both of which fell victim to blockbuster \\"The Avengers.\\"      \\"I'm very happy about it. The uniqueness of the campaign from the get-go made (the film) stand out as not just the quintessential fairy tale; it was telling a very different story,\\" Nikki Rocco, president of domestic distribution at Universal Pictures, told Reuters.      \\"Men in Black 3,\\" which opened last week, collected 29.3 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters to fall to the No. 2 position on U.S. and Canadian box office charts.      Starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as black-suited secret agents, together again for the first time since 2002, \\"MIB 3\\" ticket sales slipped by 58 percent from its opening weekend. It has collected 274.6 million in overseas markets since its release.      \\"Snow White and the Huntsman,\\" which starred Kristen Stewart from box office hit \\"The Twilight Saga\\" vampire films, Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth from \\"The Avengers,\\" is the second film this year inspired by the classic fairy tale.      In March, \\"Mirror Mirror,\\" starring Julia Roberts as the evil queen, failed to gain large audiences with 18 million on its first weekend and 62 million in domestic ticket sales.      Producers of that film rushed to beat \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" to the screen, changing their opening date from June to March.      \\"The filmmakers, producers and the talent knew how different this film would be. We had no concern whatsoever,\\" said Rocco. \\"Mirror Mirror\\" was ... targeted to little girls. They tried to make a comedy of it. That's not what we were intending to do.\\"      Hollywood experts had predicted that \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" would open with a relatively paltry 35 million in ticket sales, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com.      The film, which was made for 170 million, needed 42 million in ticket sales over the weekend to break-even, according to analyst Tony Wible, managing director of Janney Montgomery Scott.      A film generally completes its run with three times its opening weekend gross, and its studio gets about half the ticket sales revenue. A film also generates revenue from home video and other sales after its theatrical run.      \\"AVENGERS\\" MAKES MOVIE HISTORY      In its fifth week in theaters, \\"The Avengers\\" collection of Marvel superheros continued to flex its muscles, earning 20.3 million and taking the third position.

Question:   What happens when you make a rocket heavier goes higher or falls down?    Paragraph :  By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher. A:","output":"When you make a rocket heavier, it would generally have a harder time achieving high altitudes and may even fall down if the weight is too much for the propulsion system to overcome. The paragraph mentions the use of multiple stages to address this issue. In a multistage rocket, as one stage's fuel is used up, the empty fuel containers can be detached or dropped away from the rocket. This process of shedding mass allows the rocket to become lighter and makes it easier for it to achieve greater heights. The reduction of mass due to dropping empty fuel containers increases the overall efficiency of a rocket as it conserves fuel and thrust. By utilizing this method, the rocket not only lessens the negative effects of a heavier mass but also improves its ability to reach higher altitudes or even get into orbit. If a rocket is made heavier without any appropriate adjustments, such as a more powerful propulsion system or incorporating a multistage design, it could struggle to generate enough thrust to counteract Earth's gravitational pull and ultimately fall down or fail to reach its intended destination. In conclusion, when a rocket is made heavier, it is more likely to struggle to reach high altitudes or might even fall down, unless proper techniques like multistage design and more powerful propulsion systems are employed to alleviate the detrimental effects of the increased mass. The paragraph highlights the importance of reducing the rocket's mass by dropping away empty fuel containers to achieve better flight performance and reach higher altitudes more efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However the variola virus, which causes the infection, is not gone. It exists in two laboratories, one in the US and the other in Russia. The question is about to be asked, once again: should they kill their stocks? The World Health Organization (WHO) will come to a decision at the 64th World Health Assembly this week. It is not the first time the issue has arisen, it was first discussed at the Assembly in 1986 and has been the source of debate ever since. Destroying the remaining stocks is seen in parts as the final chapter in eradicating the disease, otherwise there is always the risk of accidental release. Others including the US and Russia argue for more research in case smallpox returns, possibly as a biological weapon. They fear vials of the virus could exist outside of their labs. The genomes of around 50 strains of the variola virus have also been fully sequenced, and research has already shown that a virus can be built from scratch with such a blueprint. Professor Geoffrey Smith, from Imperial College London, has been following the latest research on smallpox. He says studies have been focused on three areas - tests to diagnose the infection quickly and accurately, antiviral drugs to treat it and safer vaccines to prevent it. He led a review of the state of scientific research on behalf of the WHO, which was published at the end of 2010, and concluded there had been \\"remarkable advances\\" in tests for smallpox. But the same could not be said with certainty for smallpox drugs and vaccines. While new candidates have been developed, they cannot be clinically proven as there are no human smallpox patients to test them on. Without trials to prove a medicine works, the endpoint for research becomes harder to define. Professor Smith said: \\"It is fair to say the committee had mixed views on whether the research was there or nearly there but not quite.\\" The US secretary of health Kathleen Sebelius says it would be premature to destroy remaining stores of the virus now. She restated in a column for the New York Times her country's commitment to eventually destroy stocks, but not yet. She wrote: \\"We have more work to do before these safe and highly effective vaccines and antiviral treatments are fully developed and approved for use. \\"Destroying the virus now is merely a symbolic act that would slow our progress and could even stop it completely, leaving the world vulnerable.\\" But the man who led the WHO's smallpox eradication programme from 1966 until the last case in 1977 disagrees. Dr DA Henderson told the BBC: \\"I think it's a very good idea to destroy. At this point the reasons for keeping it are very obscure. Group after group has looked at this and basically said there is no need to retain it. In 1796, Edward Jenner extracted pus from a cowpox pustule on a milkmaiden and inserted it into a cut in the arm of an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps. He was working from rural folklore which said milkmaids who suffered cowpox never went onto develop smallpox. Jenner then proved that having been inoculated with cowpox Phipps was immune to smallpox. In 1959 the World Health Assembly passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox. The last natural case of smallpox was in Somalia in October 1977. In September 1978 Janet Parker, a medical photographer at the University of Birmingham died after being accidentally infected with smallpox. BBC History: Smallpox, Eradicating the Scourge \\"We have done all of the productive research that we can do. It has been discussed fully and thoroughly by people around the world. Now is the time to destroy the virus as a further deterrent to anybody ever again producing it or using it.\\" Professor John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary University of London, believes the bioterrorism threat is \\"a load of old tosh\\" but still argues in favour of keeping the virus. He said the decision was \\"tricky\\" but added: \\"I don't think there's a strong argument to destroy stocks, just an instinctive feeling to do it, which is misplaced. \\"It's eradicating a whole species and you never know what the future might hold.\\" The argument holds no weight with Professor Gareth Williams, whose book - Angel of Death - charts the history of smallpox. \\"There is no point in keeping it really. It has been sequenced completely so it can be recreated in a test tube and if it comes back you've got as much virus as you could want. \\"It's just a vague sense of political unease keeping stocks, it has nothing to do with the scientific argument.\\" No one knows what will happen when health ministers from the WHO's 193 member nations discuss the issue. Professor David Heymann, a former assistant director general for health security and environment at the World Health Organization, said there had historically been a split between the industrialised and developing countries. He said developing countries have felt it is more important to deal with \\"known risks\\" than unknown risks like smallpox, while industrialised nations have different priorities. Resolutions from the World Health Assembly are not legally binding, so the US and Russia cannot be forced to destroy stocks even if the majority of nations wanted it to happen. The Assembly could reach a consensus agreement, such as postponing the decision, rather than forcing a vote because, as Professor Heymann puts it, \\"nobody wants to see the World Health Organization lose power\\" if its rulings are ignored.

She was tired of struggling and fighting and wanted to give up. So, her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out, pulled the eggs out and then poured the coffee into three different bowls. Turning to her daughter, she asked, \\"Tell me what you see.\\" \\"Carrots, eggs, and coffee,\\" she replied. Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the daughter was asked to drink the coffee. She smiled as she tasted its rich fragrance. The daughter then asked, \\"What does it mean, mother?\\" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same disaster but reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, and hard. However, after being subject to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The coffee beans were unique, however; after they had been in the boiling water, they had changed the water.                \\"Which are you?\\" she asked her daughter. \\"When misfortune or change knocks on your door, how do you respond?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the place which seemingly grew no nearer in the succeeding days though the pair continued struggling toward it? ?  The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south.  However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained.  On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was apparent that they were in an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land. They could only continue south in the hopes of finding a...

Use evidence from the fact that living things all require energy for survival to answer this question: \\"If I wanted to get more energy after exerting myself too much\\"","output":"If you wanted to get more energy after exerting yourself too much, it is essential first to understand how living organisms, including humans, obtain and utilize energy for various biological processes.  Firstly, living things have various cellular processes that require energy to function. This energy is produced in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. ATP is generated through cellular respiration, a process in which the cells break down nutrients like glucose to release energy. Considering this fact, when one exerts themselves too much, their energy reserves are likely to be depleted. As a result, the body requires more nutrients and other vital compounds to restore its balance. To gain more energy following intense physical activity, there are several ways you can achieve this: 1. Rehydrate: Staying hydrated is critical to maintaining energy levels. During exertion, you lose water and electrolytes, leading to fatigue or even dehydration. Drinking water or electrolyte-containing beverages can help restore balance and maintain energy levels. 2. Eat the right nutrients: Consuming a diet rich in macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is vital to replenishing energy stores. High-quality carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, provide glucose, which the body uses to generate ATP. Lean proteins, such as poultry, fish, or legumes, supply amino acids to rebuild and maintain muscles. Consuming healthy fats, like those found in nuts, seeds, and avocado, can also provide long-lasting energy. 3. Get proper rest: After strenuous exercise, it is essential to rest and allow your body to recover. This recovery period helps in restoring energy reserves, repairing damaged muscle tissues, and improving overall body functions. Generally, it is recommended to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night to reap the benefits of restorative rest. 4. Consume energy-boosting foods: Some foods can help enhance energy production in the body, such as bananas, oatmeal, almonds, and lentils. These sources are either rich in nutrients required for energy synthesis or work as natural stimulants to increase alertness and help fight fatigue. 5. Regulate blood sugar: Unstable blood sugar levels can cause fluctuations in energy levels and leave you feeling sluggish. Stabilizing blood sugar by eating balanced meals and snacks, rich in fibers, proteins, and healthy fats, can keep your energy levels more consistent. 6. Manage stress: Stress can have a significant impact on energy levels, as it often causes both mental and physical fatigue. Engaging in stress-reduction techniques like meditation, mindfulness, or yoga can help enhance overall well-being and increase energy. In summary, if you want to get more energy after exerting yourself too much, it is essential to focus on the aspects of rehydration, proper nutrition, rest, stress management, and consuming foods thatboost energy. By addressing these factors, you will be better equipped to restore and optimize your body's energy production and overall functionality, allowing you to recover more effectively from strenuous physical activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Are Rose McDowall and Corinne Drewery both in the same band? Answer:","output":"After conducting an analysis of each artist's career, it is evident that Rose McDowall and Corinne Drewery are not in the same band. They have, in fact, made individual contributions to different bands in the music industry. Let's delve deeper into their respective careers. Rose McDowall, born in 1959, is a Scottish musician best known for her work as the vocalist for the alternative bands Strawberry Switchblade and Spell. Strawberry Switchblade, formed in 1981, was a duo comprising of McDowall and Jill Bryson. They received considerable attention in the early 1980s with their blend of post-punk, synthpop, and new wave music. McDowall later formed the experimental group Spell in the 1990s, which was a collaborative effort between her and Boyd Rice, an American musician. Some other notable collaborations in McDowall's career include: 1. Current 93 - An experimental music group led by David Tibet. 2. Coil - An experimental electronic group led by John Balance and Peter Christopherson. 3. Psychic TV - A British experimental group led by Genesis P-Orridge. 4. Death In June - A British post-punk group led by Douglas P. Over the years, Rose McDowall has worked with numerous other artists and has released several solo projects. However, none of these collaborations or solo works have included a partnership with Corinne Drewery. Corinne Drewery, on the other hand, is an English singer and fashion designer born in 1959. She is best known as the lead vocalist for the British acid jazz and sophisti-pop group Swing Out Sister. With origins dating back to 1985, Swing Out Sister was formed by Drewery, Andy Connell, and Martin Jackson. The band earned international recognition in the late 1980s and 1990s for their combination of pop, jazz, and electronic music, providing a platform for Drewery's soulful voice. Throughout her career, Corinne Drewery has mainly focused on her work with Swing Out Sister. Although she occasionally dabbles in solo projects or lends her vocal talents to other artists, she has never been associated with the same bands as Rose McDowall. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that Rose McDowall and Corinne Drewery are not members of the same band. Rather, they have each carved out their own distinct paths within the music industry, earning independent acclaim and fan bases."},{"instruction":"Given the question: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety.

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum  in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity  to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal  and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines  and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides. We put turbines into the mouth of the river. Then the tide comes in, the water turns the turbines and then it goes out, it turns them again. Which of these ways will be used to run our cars in the future? Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE? - There is more petroleum than we can use now. - Trees are needed for some other things besides making gas. - We got electricity from ocean tides in the old days. - Gas wasn't used to run cars in the Second World War. The answer is:","output":"\\"Trees are needed for some other things besides making gas.\\"  The article clearly emphasizes that we can't cut down all our trees to make gas because we need our trees for other things too. This assertion makes sense given the many uses of trees, including supplying oxygen, conserving water, supporting wildlife, and providing raw materials for construction and paper industries. Contrarily, the remaining statements are inaccurately reflective of the information presented in the article. The first statement, \\"There is more petroleum than we can use now,\\" is untrue as the article begins by highlighting the lacking availability of oil. The third statement, \\"We got electricity from ocean tides in the old days,\\" is not verified in the text, which only mentions the potential for harnessing power from ocean tides in the future. Lastly, the fourth statement, \\"Gas wasn't used to run cars in the Second World War,\\" is incorrect.

Birthday presents wrapped in colorful paper, brown paper packages mailed from a friend. No matter what kind of box it is, people like to open it up and see what's inside. In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It's called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course of history. Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means \\"the people rule,\\" an important concept in American history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colonies angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the government of England didn't represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government. An effective democracy holds regular elections. In America, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the polls to elect the nation's president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law. In the American electoral system, people don't really vote for presidential candidates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for \\"electors\\" who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number of its representatives in the House (which is based on the state's population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state's electors. To win the presidential election, a candidate must gain at least 270 of the 538 total electoral votes.

While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Context: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen). That night, D'Artagnan is pleasantly surprised when Bernajou's ward Constance (Heather Angel) enters the room. It turns out that it is actually her chamber, though she is rarely there, as she spends most of her time at the palace as lady-in-waiting to the Queen. Constance has arranged a rendezvous between Queen Anne (Rosamond Pinchot) and her lover, the English Duke of Buckingham (Ralph Forbes).

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Article:","output":"Title: Maximizing Engagement Through Online Course Management Systems Introduction: As online learning becomes more prevalent in education, both instructors and students must adapt to new methods of engagement, communication, and assessment. An essential tool for managing an online course is the online management system, which allows instructors to organize, deliver, and monitor coursework while providing students with a platform for easy access and collaboration. In this article, we will discuss how to effectively use an online management system for managing a course, including monitoring student postings, preparing interactive lesson plans, presenting learning content in varied formats, and keeping students informed of deadlines. Step 1: Get Familiar with the Online Management System: Before diving into teaching an online course, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the management system to ensure smooth and effective communication with students. Take time to explore available features such as discussion boards, grade books, assignment submissions, and event scheduling. Explore customization options that can enhance your course and make it more engaging for students. Test the system's functionality, and consider collaborating with colleagues or attending available training sessions to ensure proficiency. Step 2: Monitor Student Postings: Communication plays a vital role in online learning, and the online management system often serves as the primary channel for students to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate. Keep track of student postings on discussion boards, forums, and messaging platforms within the system to maintain a pulse on students' understanding and engagement. Respond to questions and comments promptly to clarify doubts and encourage further discussion. Monitoring and engaging with student postings also allow for early identification of struggling students, enabling timely intervention. Step 3: Prepare Interactive Lesson Plans: An essential element of effective online teaching is the integration of interactive activities that engage students and promote active learning. Include activities such as group discussions, problem-solving exercises, and polls in your lesson plans. Utilize the features available within the online management system to facilitate these activities, making sure that instructions are clear and concise. Provide ample opportunities for students to collaborate and learn from one another, fostering a sense of community within the online classroom. Step 4: Present Learning Content in Varied Formats: Online learning offers multiple avenues for the presentation of content. Instructors should take advantage of this diversity by providing learning resources in various formats, catering to different learning styles. Present content through a mix of text, images, videos, and audio to accommodate all learners. Incorporate interactive elements such as quizzes, simulations, and self-check assessments to gauge understanding and provide immediate feedback for students. Step 5: Keep Students Informed of Deadlines and Due Dates: Timely reminders and updates regarding upcoming deadlines, due dates, and events are crucial in an online course, where students may have limited face-to-face interactions with instructors and peers. Post daily updates in prominent locations within the online management system, such as announcement sections, main forums, and email notifications. Clear and consistent communication helps students stay on track and manage their time effectively.  Conclusion: Online course management systems play a crucial role in facilitating adaptive and engaging learning experiences for students. By taking advantage of these systems' features and fostering a supportive online community, instructors can create an effective and enjoyable online learning environment for their students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. This can include resources such as energy, supplies and other materials. Make this list available to all your employees so that they know how much is being consumed on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. This is probably the most cautious and most effective beginning point for any established business in terms of starting to go green. By cutting pack, you can start saving your company money almost immediately. Seeing immediate results will give you (and your employees) incentive to keep going. For example, consider making a preliminary goal of cutting back on energy usage. If you decided to use compact-fluorescent lights or LED lights, you will use 75 percent less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs. This means that you will save roughly 200 per bulb over time because these bulbs last longer and use less energy than standard lightbulbs.Use this Energy Savings Calculator to help determine the value of switching to energy efficient bulbs: http://www.bulbs.com/learning/energycalc.aspx. How much paper does your business use daily? Studies show that a typical office disposes approximately 350 pounds of waste paper per employee per year. Can you cut down on your paper use? Try switching to digital procedures to invoice your clients and pay your bills. Scan in important contracts and email them rather than printing them and putting them in the mail. Discourage staff in your office from printing every email or even other documentation.  Teach workers how to sort their emails, so they don't have to rely on hard copies. Encourage them to read necessary presentations, emails, or documents on screen. When printing is necessary, use both sides of the paper (double-sided printing). To make sure people remember this, it's helpful if you set your printer to automatically print double sided. You can also program your fax machine not to print out confirmation pages. When you do have to use paper, make sure you use post-consumer waste (PCW) paper. PCW paper is made completely from paper that is put in recycling bins and requires 45 percent less energy and makes half the waste of traditional paper making. Be sure to properly train your employees on using the equipment that they need to use. This will help to ensure workers don't make mistakes or waste resources. While it may not seem like a business practice that will help make your business more green, you may be surprised at the positive impact it will have on the greenness of your company. This will give you a better idea about your business's energy efficiency. This constitutes another area in which you can reduce consumption and waste. Make sure that all of your equipment is up-to-date and working properly.  If your appliances or machinery require servicing, make sure it is done regularly. This will make sure that the machinery stays in top condition and will make a more pleasant work experience for your employees as well. If you are in need of new or updated appliances, look for Energy Star appliances which have labels that will help you to assess their energy requirements. Even the things your company isn't using directly to make products or selling can be resource wasters. For example, do you have energy-efficient hand dryers in your restrooms, or are you still depending on paper towels?  Check things like faucets and toilets. If you have a leaky faucet or a cracked toilet, get it fixed to avoid wasting valuable resources. Make sure that your staff turns off all the lights and equipment at the end of the day to avoid wasting energy when no one is at work. It's helpful to assign someone to be responsible for this daily. Put up signs around the workplace to remind everyone. After a quarter or a year, put up charts showing a comparison of energy savings thanks to employees' efforts. This will help to motivate your employees to keep up energy-conscious behaviors. Switch to energy efficient appliances. Compact fluorescent bulbs use 15 to 20 percent of the energy of an incandescent bulb, last longer and produce as much light. Post a list of energy, supply, and material usage (you can focus on how much is used per month, per quarter, or per year), and alongside this list, post a list of goals for the end of a period of time.  Include an incentive if your company can reach your goals. For example, you may want to incentivize your employees with a casual dress day for reaching a resource-reduction goal, or you may  want to create an intra-company competition that pits one department against another and offers something like an extra vacation day for the department that reduces consumption the most. Many states will help you with appliance replacements, light bulb replacements, insulation, window replacements, etc. Do a Google search for free energy audits. Many states will perform these energy audits for free, and some will pay for some or all necessary repairs. This can help to identify simple changes that can be made to make yours a greener business.","output":"Incorporate green practices by tracking resource usage, using energy-efficient appliances and digital procedures, training employees, and offering incentives to reduce waste, ultimately saving company money and conserving resources."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The short was included in the Criterion Collection 's \`\` The Complete Jacques Tati '' box set , in a disc containing every short Tati either directed or starred in restored in 2K , which was released on both Blu - ray and DVD on October 18 , 2014 .  - Jacques Tati (born Jacques Tatischeff, ; 9 October 1907  5 November 1982) was a French filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter. Throughout his long career, he worked as a comic actor, writer, and director. In a poll conducted by \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" of the Greatest Movie Directors, Tati was voted the 46th greatest of all time. With only six feature-length films to his credit as director, he directed fewer films than any other director on this list of 50.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.    What is the relationship between 'gai dimanche' and 'french'? The answer to this question is:","output":"'Gai Dimanche' is a French film that was written by and starred Jacques Tati, a French filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter. Therefore, the relationship between 'Gai Dimanche' and 'French' is that 'Gai Dimanche' is a piece of French cinema created by French filmmaker Jacques Tati. This connection relies on the information provided about the nationality of Tati and the film he worked on, 'Gai Dimanche,' which establishes the relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, New York City vaudeville actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with Herb, Carl's cameraman, Mike, Carl's soundman, Preston, Carl's assistant, and actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall.

Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, he meets a laid-back dog named Dodger who assists him in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Afghan Hound, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Bill Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin it must be paid in three days, or else. Sykes' dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver but he is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money. After the dogs cheer him up, he is introduced to Oliver, and, considering that they all need help, accepts him into the gang. The next day, Fagin and his dogs, now including Oliver, hit the streets to sell some shoddy goods and perhaps steal money.

Goal: baking powder substitiution Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPT: (I). use baking soda and cream of tartar (II). use salt and baking soda, mixed with a little sugar...I think the answer is","output":"To determine which method is more reasonable for substituting baking powder, let's consider the purpose and properties of baking powder and the properties of the ingredients in each option. Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking to help dough and batters rise. It is a mixture of a base (usually baking soda) and an acid, which create a chemical reaction producing carbon dioxide gas, creating air bubbles and causing the dough to rise. Option I: Use baking soda and cream of tartar In this method, baking soda, a base, is combined with cream of tartar, an acid, to mimic the properties of baking powder. Proportions typically used are: 1. 2 parts cream of tartar to 1 part baking soda Steps for this method: 1. Combine baking soda and cream of tartar in a bowl. 2. Mix thoroughly to create the substitute for baking powder. Option II: Use salt, baking soda, and a little sugar In this method, baking soda is combined with salt and sugar. However, this combination lacks an acidic component, and the chemical reaction required to make the dough or batter rise will not occur. Steps for this method: 1. Combine baking soda, salt, and sugar in a bowl. 2. Mix together for the substitution, although this will not work effectively as a baking powder substitute due to the missing acidic component. Based on the properties and purpose of baking powder, Option I (baking soda and cream of tartar) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of substituting baking powder. It effectively mimics the base and acid combination of baking powder, ensuring the desired leavening occurs in the recipe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

However, their experience was not satisfactory as the explanations between poses were excessively long. The reviewer specifically mentions that they were able to perform only 4 or 5 poses despite watching 30 minutes of the video, highlighting their disappointment in the inefficient usage of time.

As the primary purpose of a product review is to share honest opinions and experiences of the product with others, it is important to consider the sentiment expressed in the review when making a purchasing decision. In this case, the negative sentiment and dissatisfaction shared by the reviewer might deter potential buyers from considering the product, potentially affecting its sales and overall reputation.

Premise: \\"So my duties were restricted to parading around in public and the occasional wave.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I was only allowed to parade down the street once a week.\\"?","output":"If we analyze the given premise, \\"So my duties were restricted to parading around in public and the occasional wave,\\" it tells us that the speaker's duties involve recurring public appearances where they parade and sometimes engage in waving gestures. However, the premise does not provide explicit information about the frequency for these duties, i.e., how often the speaker is required to parade or wave. Now let us consider the hypothesis, \\"I was only allowed to parade down the street once a week.\\" This statement is a specific claim regarding the frequency of the parading activity mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis confines the parading activity to a fixed schedule, occurring only once a week. Although both the premise and the hypothesis revolve around the parading activity, the premise does not entail the hypothesis as they provide different information regarding the activity. The premise focuses on the nature of the duties, while the hypothesis determines their frequency. The given premise simply does not provide enough grounds to conclude the frequency of parading or the limitation to once a week. If we were to relate the premise and hypothesis logically, we would say that the hypothesis is only a possible conclusion drawn from the premise. The parading frequency could also be daily, bi-weekly, or monthly, among other possibilities. Therefore, based on the premise alone, we cannot decisively conclude the validity of the hypothesis \\"I was only allowed to parade down the street once a week.\\" However, we can speculate that the hypothesis could be true, but it could also be false or partially true (with altered frequency).

Nonetheless, we can discuss the possibilities by carefully examining the given information. Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis in detail: Premise: - Some businesses are staffed by non-attorneys. - These businesses have adopted \\"legal aid\\" or similar names, which could lead people to believe they are nonprofit organizations. Hypothesis: - These businesses are using the non-attorney staff to their advantage. - The motive behind using these staff members is to gain large profits. The premise establishes that certain businesses have adopted names that might confuse people into thinking they're nonprofit organizations because they use terms like \\"legal aid\\" or similar phrases. It also states that these businesses are staffed by non-attorney personnel. However, this premise doesn't explicitly indicate whether these businesses achieve or aim to achieve large profits. Moreover, the premise doesn't confirm if these businesses are deliberately misleading consumers or if it's an unintentional coincidence. The hypothesis suggests that these businesses are indeed trying to take advantage of their non-attorney staff in order to achieve large profits. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we need to consider various scenarios and evaluate supporting or contradicting evidence. One possibility is that these businesses might be intentionally using confusing names to lead people to think they're nonprofits, and by doing so, they might attract customers who are looking for affordable or pro bono legal assistance. In this case, the hypothesis could be accurate because using this perception to their advantage could result in increased profits. On the other hand, the businesses could be using the terms \\"legal aid\\" or similar phrases without realizing the confusion it might cause. In this scenario, they may not be intentionally taking advantage of their non-attorney staff or the public's perception. This could suggest that the hypothesis is not accurate. Given the information we have from the premise, there are multiple possibilities, and it is impossible to confirm or deny the hypothesis without more data. Thus, the most appropriate answer would be option (ii), as it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis is true based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The information available suggests that Mike did not know how to properly do laundry tasks. Firstly, in the given scenario, Greg asked Mike if he could take care of the laundry. Although Mike agreed to do so, he agreed with a caveat, implying that he needed a price or compensation for the task. This could indicate that Mike was either inexperienced with laundry or did not feel comfortable taking on the responsibility without some form of incentive. When Mike proceeded to wash Greg's clothes, the paragraph states that he \\"mixed all the colors and ruined the clothes.\\" This shows that Mike lacked knowledge about the importance of separating clothing by color before washing. As a result, the mixed colors caused damage to Greg's clothes, leaving him understandably upset. The paragraph does not provide any information indicating that Mike learned the correct methods to do laundry after committing these errors. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the statement \\"Mike learned how to do laundry\\" is accurate based solely on the given information and the aftermath of the incident between Greg and Mike. However, it may be reasonable to assume that Mike would have been confronted by Greg about his mistakes or would have figured out on his own that he made errors in the given situation. This may have led Mike to learn more about doing laundry properly in the future, but as it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, we cannot make this conclusion with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: How do you accurately measure a liquid in a glass measuring cup? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accurately measure a liquid in a glass measuring cup, it is essential to follow specific steps and utilize the proper techniques. Below is a detailed explanation of the most sensible method to accomplish this goal. 1. Choose the right measuring cup: Select a glass measuring cup with the appropriate size and clearly marked measurements for the volume of liquid you need to measure. Glass measuring cups usually come in different capacities, such as 1 cup (250 mL), 2 cups (500 mL), or 4 cups (1 L). Make sure the glass measuring cup has metric or standard (US) units corresponding to the recipe you are following. 2. Place the measuring cup on a flat surface: Ensuring the glass measuring cup sits on a level surface is crucial for obtaining an accurate measurement. Place the cup on a counter or table in an area with good lighting, which will aid in reading the measurements correctly. 3. Check and adjust your line of sight: Position your eyes at the same level as the measuring marks on the glass cup. This perspective helps prevent parallax errors that can occur if you view the measurements from an angle above or below the cup. This error typically leads to over- or under-pouring the liquid. 4. Pour the liquid slowly: Begin pouring the liquid into the glass measuring cup, taking care not to overshoot the desired quantity. It is better to pour less at first and then gradually add more if needed. 5. Check the meniscus: As you pour the liquid into the measuring cup, observe its surface. Most liquids, particularly water-based ones, form a slightly curved surface called the meniscus. For an accurate measurement, the bottom of the meniscus should be aligned with the desired marking on the measuring cup. 6. Add more liquid or remove excess if necessary: If you need to add more liquid, do so carefully while keeping your eye level with the measuring mark. If you accidentally pour too much, use a pipette, a clean spoon, or a straw to remove the excess liquid until the meniscus reaches the desired level. 7. Double-check the measurement: Verify your measurement by looking at the meniscus from a different angle to ensure that your initial view was accurate. 8. Transfer the liquid: Once you have confirmed that the measurement is accurate, transfer the liquid from the glass measuring cup to your recipe or container. Pour slowly and steadily, making sure to use a spatula or scraper to get any remaining liquid out of the cup. By following these steps and techniques, you can accurately measure a liquid in a glass measuring cup and ensure that the liquid quantity in your recipe is precise, resulting in a successful and delicious outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

Wochit Papa John's founder and CEO  John Schnatter  is stepping down. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas  Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)  Papa John's CEO John Schnatter  who overcame the odds to build his home-delivery pizza chain into a national powerhouse against entrenched rivals   is stepping down.  Schnatter  who founded the pizza chain in 1984   will remain as chairman of the board. No immediate reason was given for  his  decision  which takes effect Jan. 1.  He  is being replaced CEO is company President Steve Ritchie. As the founder  Schnatter has been one of the biggest names in fast food. But  he  recently ran into controversy when  he  blamed NFL players' mass move to drop to one knee during the playing of the national anthem as affecting  his  company's sales.  Schnatter  has been one of the last CEOs who also act as  their  brand's advertising pitchman  a list that once included Col. Harland Sanders for Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dave Thomas of Wendy's. By stressing that Papa John's had better ingredients and a better tasting product  he was able to turn the burgeoning chain into a national force against giants like Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut. The company  which has more than 5 000 locations worldwide  said in a statement that  Schnatter  will continue to \\"pursue  his  personal passion for entrepreneurship  leadership development and education.\\" Louisville-based Papa John's is the official pizza sponsor of the National Football League  which  Schnatter  slammed in November for not dealing with players who've been kneeling during the Star Spangled Banner to protest racial injustice. The movement began with then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016. \\"The NFL has been a long and valued partner over the years. But we're certainly disappointed that the NFL and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago \\"  Schnatter  said during a Nov. 1 analyst call. \\"This should've been nipped in the bud a year-and-a-half ago.\\"  Schnatter  isn't the first founder to step away recently from CEO duties at the company  he  built from scratch. Last month  Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Steve Ells would become executive chairman and Panera Bread's Ron Shaich announced that he would step down  but retain his position as board chairman. And  Schnatter himself  has said goodbye to the CEO gig before.  He  stepped down in 2005  but returned in 2008. In 2010   he  took on a co-CEO  Jude Thompson  but that arrangement ended the following year. Now Papa John's may decide to find a new pitchman besides  Schnatter . â He âs in every ad \\" Gordon said. \\"Thatâs very CEO-centric marketing  which is pretty unusual these days. Weâll see if  he  steps back from that.â  He  added  â He  and/or the board see the need to get  him  out of the line on fire and to continue  his  involvement in a less visible way.â Output:","output":"Papa John's CEO John Schnatter Steps Down"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Expand this summary.","output":"In an unusual turn of events, New York City, along with other major cities such as Philadelphia and Boston, has been placed under a tornado watch until 8 pm, according to NBC New York. This watch also extends to the neighboring counties of Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, and Putnam. These areas are being closely monitored by weather officials, as tornadoes are an infrequent occurrence in these regions, particularly in highly populated urban areas like New York City. The tornado watch has been issued as a result of unusual weather patterns and storm systems moving through the area. Residents are advised to stay informed and prepared for potential severe weather, such as strong winds, heavy rainfall, and even hail. Emergency management and local authorities are closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates and guidance as necessary. The northeastern region has experienced a variety of unusual weather phenomena lately, as evidenced by yesterday's \\"Manhattanhenge,\\" a rare event where the sunset aligns perfectly with the city's east-west street grid, casting beautiful light displays on the streets of Manhattan. Manhattanhenge generally occurs twice a year—around late May and mid-July—and has become a popular event for photographers and astronomy enthusiasts alike. Several photos capturing the stunning views of the sunset in New York City have been circulating on social media and news outlets. In light of these recent meteorological occurrences, the tornado watch raises concerns regarding the safety of residents and the potential for property damage in these densely populated areas. The public is encouraged to stay alert and follow any safety precautions outlined by the National Weather Service and local authorities, such as securing loose outdoor items, staying indoors during severe weather, and having a preparedness plan in place. Although tornadoes are typically associated with the central United States, known as \\"Tornado Alley,\\" they can indeed occur elsewhere in the country. This highlights the importance of understanding and being prepared for severe weather events, even in regions where they are less common. Overall, the tornado watch in New York City and the surrounding areas is a reminder that extreme weather events can occur in unexpected places and warrants vigilance and preparedness from both citizens and officials alike. As the situation develops, it is essential for everyone to stay informed and take any necessary precautions to ensure their own safety and that of their communities."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

(CNN) -- Britain's Chris Froome won the 17th stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday to strengthen his grip on the yellow jersey. Froome completed Wednesday's 32-kilometer time trial in 51 minutes 33 seconds, nine seconds ahead of Spain's Alberto Contador with his compatriot Joaquim Rodriguez Oliver finishing a further second behind in third. \\"I couldn't believe it when I got over the line and saw I had the fastest time,\\" Froome said after his third stage win of this year's tour. \\"I went into today thinking I was going to try and limit my losses, thinking about the days to come now. So to go through the finish line with the fastest time, I really didn't see that coming.\\" On mountainous terrain along a frequently twisting route most of the riders opted for their traditional road bikes over the more aerodynamic machines used in time trials. But Froome opted to use both on the stage, switching to a time trial model for the final 12-kilometer descent. The swap proved decisive as the Briton clawed back a 20-second advantage Contador had built up earlier in the stage. The Spaniard now moves up to second overall, four minutes 34 seconds behind Froome with just four stages remaining. Contador's Saxo-Tinkoff teammate Roman Kreuziger is now third and trails Froome by four minutes and 51 seconds. Thursday sees the riders tackle the gruelling 172.5-kilometer 18th stage which concludes with a double ascent of Alpe d'Huez over the last 60 kilometers.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\".

I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who held a position for 33 years?  Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune.  It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.  Furthermore,  when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s.  The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.  Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...

It's just a bunch of poorly produced, humorless, hookless tracks.Please don't buy it. Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","output":"Negative. Step 1: Read the review carefully, paying attention to the language used and the overall tone of the review. Step 2: Identify words or phrases that convey the reviewer's opinion. In this case, words like \\"horrible,\\" \\"bad music,\\" \\"poorly produced,\\" \\"humorless,\\" and \\"hookless\\" are used, all of which convey a negative opinion. Step 3: Look for specific points or examples the reviewer is using to support their opinion. In this case, the reviewer explicitly says they are not trying to create viral advertising but are genuinely expressing their dislike for the album. Step 4: Determine if the reviewer is being ironic or sarcastic. In this case, the review is not ironic or sarcastic as it explicitly states, \\"I'm not kidding.\\" Step 5: Analyze the overall tone and content of the review. In this case, the review discusses how terrible the album is, how it lacks good production, and it is missing any redeemable qualities. Step 6: Based on the analysis of the language, specific points, and overall tone, determine if the review is positive or negative. In this case, it is clearly a negative review as the reviewer is expressing their dislike for the album and advising others not to purchase it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(1). no; (2). yes;","output":"(1). How many zeros are in 1 million? 1 million is written as 1,000,000. In this numerical representation, there are 6 zeros. It is important to note that 1 million represents 10 to the power of 6 (10^6), which means multiplying the number 10 by itself six times (10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10). (2). What is the degree of 1? Is it zero or one? The question appears to be asking about the degree of a polynomial. A polynomial is a mathematical expression involving a sum of terms, each term including a variable raised to a power and multiplied by a coefficient. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable within the polynomial.  If the given polynomial is simply \\"1\\" (a constant), it does not contain any variable like x. In this case, the degree of the constant polynomial is considered to be 0. The reason for this is that when you multiply a constant by the variable with the power of 0, the constant remains unchanged. For example, 1 * x^0 = 1 (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1). So, the degree of the polynomial \\"1\\" is 0. (3). Do those questions have the same meaning? No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is related to the numerical representation of a specific number, whereas the second question pertains to the degree of a polynomial in a mathematical context.  The only similarity between the two questions is that they both deal with numbers in some aspect.

He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first \\"Star Wars\\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing). I can't review \\"Star Wars\\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home.

Translate to English","output":"At the same time, a visa facilitation regime is of great importance for people's lives, as it strengthens contacts between people and contributes to the realization of the idea of free movement, which is one of the fundamental rights in Europe. Simultaneously, a visa facilitation regime holds significant importance for individuals' lives, as it fortifies connections between people and contributes to materializing the concept of free movement, which is one of the fundamental rights in Europe. Visa facilitation regimes play an essential role in people's lives by fostering stronger relationships between individuals and promoting the idea of free movement – a cornerstone in European fundamental rights. These regimes, primarily designed to simplify and streamline visa application processes, provide vital support for those wishing to visit, work, or study in European countries. The European Union has long been an advocate for free movement, ensuring that citizens within the Schengen Area can travel, live, and work without the need for visas or border checks. Visa facilitation regimes enhance this fundamental right by making it easier for non-EU nationals to experience the benefits of European integration and participate in cultural, economic, and educational exchanges. The impact of visa facilitation regimes on people's lives can be observed through various aspects. Firstly, it increases personal freedom and mobility, enabling individuals to visit friends, family, or simply discover new countries and cultures. By reducing excessive restrictions and allowing for easier travel, people can build stronger connections between nations, ultimately fostering mutual understanding and respect. Secondly, visa facilitation regimes promote economic growth and opportunities, as they attract tourists, investors, and skilled workers to European countries. The increased flow of commerce, investments, and knowledge exchange can bolster various industries, leading to job creation and a more competitive economy. Moreover, the facilitation of visas for students and professionals fosters exchange programs, which can be mutually beneficial for both the individual and the respective countries. Lastly, the ease of visa requirements can contribute to the pursuit and improvement of human rights standards. Visa facilitation allows for more straightforward access to refugees and asylum seekers and can help reunite families separated due to conflict or persecution. Furthermore, it encourages dialogue and cooperation between countries, assisting the promotion of humanitarian values and policies. In conclusion, the importance of visa facilitation regimes should not be underestimated, as they significantly impact many aspects of people's lives. By fostering connections between individuals and countries, spurring economic growth and opportunities, and promoting the protection of fundamental rights, such regimes contribute to the broader European objective of integration, unity, and shared prosperity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

French painter Michel Marnet meets American singer Terry McKay aboard a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean. They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke, she to Kenneth Bradley. They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his notoriety and popularity on the ship make them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel's grandmother Janou, who approves of Terry and wants Michel to settle down. As the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet six months later on top of the Empire State Building. Michel chooses six months because that is the amount of time he needs to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry.  When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building.  However, Terry is struck by a car right as she arrives, and is told that she may not be able to walk, though that will not be known for certain for six months.

Six months go by, and during Terry's first outing since the accident, the two couples meet by accident at the theater, though Terry manages to conceal her condition.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on?  The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group.... The answer is:","output":"Something Else By The Kinks"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

When Will is murdered Joe decides to uncover the mystery behind his death on his own. Sounds like it could be interesting huh? Well, seems like most of you have but I just coulded get into this one.

Additionally, the reviewer states that they felt relieved when the novel finished, indicating that they did not enjoy the reading experience. Despite seeing numerous positive reviews on the website, the user's personal experience with the novel remained unchanged after giving it another chance.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing.

Check your description of plan benefits for information on behavioral health services or coverage for mental health. When in doubt, ask the human resources representative of your insurance company directly. And, ask the therapist if they accept your insurance before making your first appointment. Otherwise you may have to pay out of pocket when you could be seeing a therapist in your insurer's network.  When you meet, remember to take care of payment, scheduling, and insurance questions at the start of the session. This way you will be able to end the session sharing, without the disturbance of logistical issues like calendar checking and payment.  Know that if you see a therapist in a private practice, they may provide you with a receipt that you will submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You might be responsible for the entire cost of the visit up front, and then be reimbursed through your insurance company. Therapists come from many different backgrounds, and have different forms of education, specialization, certification, and licensing. \\"Psychotherapist\\" is a general term, rather than a specific job title or indication of education, training or licensure.   The following are red flags, indicating that the therapist may not be properly qualified:  No information provided about your rights as a client, confidentiality, office policies, and fees (all of which would allow you to fairly consent to your therapy) No license issued by the state or jurisdiction in which they practice. A degree from a non-accredited institution. Unresolved complaints filed with their licensing board. The more information your therapist has about you, the better they will be able to do their job. Helpful documents might include reports from previous psychological tests or recent hospital discharge summaries. If you are a student, you may also want to bring recent grades or other recent markers of progress. This will be helpful during your intake interview, when the therapist may ask you to fill out forms about your current and past physical and emotional health.  By streamlining this part of your visit, you and your therapist will have more opportunity to get to know each other on a person-to-person level. If you are already taking any medications for mental or physical health, or if you have recently stopped a medication, you will want to come prepared with the following information:  Name of the drug(s) Your dosage Side effects you are experiencing Contact information of the providing doctor(s) When meeting for the first time, you may have lots of different questions and concerns. In order to address everything you want to know, write some notes reminding you to gather all the information you need. Bringing these to your first session will help you feel less confused and more at ease. Notes might include the following questions for your therapist:  What therapeutic approach do you use? How will we define our goals? Will you expect me to complete assignments to do between sessions? How frequently will we meet? Will our work together be short-term or long-term? Are you willing to collaborate with my other health care providers to treat me more effectively? Because therapy is meant to provide you with a safe space to work on yourself, time must be managed wisely. Once you are in the session it's the therapist's job to keep track of time, allowing you to focus on answering questions and adjusting to the feel of therapy. But, it's up to you to get yourself to that point. Be aware that some private therapists charge for missed appointments, and these fees are not covered by insurance. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article talks about how to prepare for psychotherapy, which is a type of treatment for mental health problems.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash.  Who is causing more marine pollution?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Answer:","output":"Considering the information provided and the hint about the primary sources and consequences of marine pollution, it can be concluded that Hilda is causing more marine pollution. The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river, which is next to Hilda's farm.

Excessive nutrients from fertilizers can lead to an overgrowth of algae in the water, resulting in oxygen depletion and creating dead zones that are detrimental to aquatic life. In contrast, the Dundrin Ocean is connected to several rivers, which are mostly located in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. This suggests that the human impact on these rivers and, consequently, on the ocean is relatively minimal. Luke, who owns the only farm near the Dundrin Ocean, does not dispose of any garbage in the ocean or nearby rivers. Instead, he stores excess fertilizer for future use or disposes of it properly. By doing so, Luke ensures that he does not contribute to marine pollution in the Dundrin Ocean. In conclusion, Hilda's longstanding practice of dumping excess fertilizer into the river connected to the Malegese Ocean results in a higher level of marine pollution. Luke's responsible approach to waste management and commitment to storing or properly disposing of excess fertilizer significantly reduces his impact on the Dundrin Ocean's environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This suggests that the speaker believes human capital is highly valuable to the federal government. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"The people, or human capital, are not the most important asset to the federal government.\\" This is contrary to the idea presented in the premise, as it questions the importance of human capital to the federal government. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Now, we will compare the two statements to see if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise highlights the importance of human capital for the federal government, while the hypothesis questions this importance. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis Given that the premise supports the idea that human capital is the most important asset to the federal government, it does not entail the hypothesis, which states the opposite. Instead, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Conclusion: If the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis stand in opposition to each other, suggesting that only one of them can be true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given an input list. A list contains several comma-separated items written within brackets. You need to return the position of all the alphabetical elements in the given list in order. Assume the position of the 1st element to be 1. Return -1 if no alphabetical element is in the list. Q: ['j', 'w', '6679', '3781', 'H', 'D'] A:","output":"The task requires us to locate the positions of the alphabetical elements in a given list. The list consists of an assortment of values, separated by commas and enclosed by brackets.  Guidelines for the task: 1. We are looking specifically for alphabetical elements, meaning letters of the alphabet. 2. We have to note their positions in the list. For this task, the position count starts at one for the first item.  3. If no alphabetical elements are located, we should return -1. 4. Lastly, we should preserve the order of the found positions. Applying these guidelines to find the answer: Given list is ['j', 'w', '6679', '3781', 'H', 'D'] Step 1: Assess each element in the list in turn, starting with the first element.  Step 2: Check if the current element is an alphabetical character. You can use the isalpha() function for this, which returns True if all the characters in the text are letters. Step 3: If the current element is an alphabetical character, note its position in the list. Remember that index counting starts from 1 in this task, so you need to add one to the actual index. Step 4: Move on to the next element and repeat steps 2 and 3 until all elements in the list have been processed. Step 5: If you find at least one alphabetical character, return the list of positions. If not, return -1.  For the given list ['j', 'w', '6679', '3781', 'H', 'D'], the first character 'j' is an alphabetical character and it's at position 1, 'w' is at position 2, 'H' is at position 5, and 'D' is at position 6.  So, the answer would be [1, 2, 5, 6].

Background: Raymond William Stacy Burr was born May 21, 1917, in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. His father, William Johnston Burr (1889-1985), was a hardware salesman; his mother, Minerva Annette (nee Smith, 1892-1974), was a pianist and music teacher who was born in Chicago, Illinois. Burr's ancestry included Lebanese, Irish, English, Scottish, and German. When Burr was six, his parents divorced. Context: Burr was a well-known philanthropist. He gave enormous sums of money, including his salaries from the Perry Mason movies, to charity. He was also known for sharing his wealth with friends. He sponsored 26 foster children through the Foster Parents' Plan or Save The Children, many with the greatest medical needs. He also gave money and some of his Perry Mason scripts to the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  Burr was an early supporter of the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Sanibel, Florida, raising funds and chairing its first capital campaign. He also donated a large collection of Fijian cowries and cones from his island in Fiji.  In 1993, Sonoma State University awarded Burr an honorary doctorate. He supported medical and education institutions in Denver, and in 1993, the University of Colorado awarded him an honorary doctorate for his acting work. Burr also founded and financed the American Fijian Foundation that funded academic research, including efforts to develop a dictionary of the language.  Burr made repeated trips on behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffinland, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, \\"My only position on the war is that I wish it were over.\\" In October 1967, NBC aired Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam, a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. \\"The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing\\", wrote the Chicago Tribune; the Los Angeles Times called Burr's questions \\"intelligent and elicited some interesting replies\\".  Burr had a reputation in Hollywood as a thoughtful, generous man years before much of his more-visible philanthropic work. In 1960, Ray Collins, who portrayed Lt. Arthur Tragg on the original Perry Mason series, and who was by that time often ill and unable to remember all the lines he was supposed to speak, stated, \\"There is nothing but kindness from our star, Ray Burr. Part of his life is dedicated to us, and that's no bull. If there's anything the matter with any of us, he comes around before anyone else and does what he can to help.

By focusing on positive memories and experiences, individuals can foster feelings of pride, happiness, and gratitude, which can promote mental health and resilience. In summary, remembering past successes is likely to cause inspiration, as it reinforces positive beliefs about one's abilities, boosts confidence, aids in learning from past experiences, and helps maintain motivation and emotional wellness. The other choices (problems, crying, trauma, and nightmares) don't fit the context as well, as they are more likely to be triggered by negative experiences rather than successes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Ash took advantage of Alex by getting a lot of favors while returning none.  Given the question \\"What will happen to Alex?\\", is \\"get yelled at\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"While \\"get yelled at\\" could be a possible outcome for Alex in this scenario, it is important to consider various factors and potential consequences that Alex may face due to the imbalanced relationship with Ash. To provide a more detailed and elaborate answer, we must consider different aspects, including emotional, social, and psychological effects. 1. Emotional Consequences: Alex might experience emotional distress and become resentful due to Ash's exploitation. This emotional turmoil may manifest as feelings of inadequacy, rejection, or helplessness, particularly if Alex valued their relationship with Ash. Moreover, state of continuous giving without receiving might lead to disappointment, sadness, and lowered self-esteem. 2. Social Effects: Unbalanced relationships could lead to a negative reputation for both parties involved. Other people may perceive Ash as manipulative, selfish, or untrustworthy, while Alex might be seen as naive, over-accommodating, or a pushover. This perception could affect both of their social interactions and may potentially harm their relationship with other mutual friends. 3. Psychological Impact: In the long run, this continuous exploitation might lead to Alex developing negative coping mechanisms, such as a lack of trust or agoraphobic tendencies, to avoid being taken advantage of by others. Additionally, Alex could experience heightened anxiety, depression, or feelings of emptiness as a result of being exploited by someone they considered a friend. 4. Alternative Actions: Instead of just \\"getting yelled at,\\" Alex could choose to take various courses of action. They may decide to confront Ash about the imbalance in their relationship, set boundaries to protect themselves from further exploitation, or even end the relationship as a whole. If Alex decides to maintain their friendship with Ash, they might want to engage in open and honest communication, ensuring that both parties understand the implications of their actions and work towards establishing a more balanced relationship. In conclusion, while \\"getting yelled at\\" could be a potential outcome for Alex regarding their situation with Ash, it is essential to consider various other emotional, social, and psychological consequences that may arise. Additionally, how Alex chooses to address this issue might significantly impact the outcome of the situation. Thus, it is crucial to look at the entire context and possible actions when determining the consequences Alex may face."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(I) Erin was scared of rodents.; (II) Rachel was scared of rodents.;","output":"Erin liked holding the hamster more than Rachel did because Rachel was scared of rodents. While both Erin and Rachel were close friends who enjoyed trying out new experiences together, their preference for handling small animals like hamsters varied greatly. Erin, an adventurous and curious individual, always found herself drawn to animals and loved understanding their unique characteristics. She enjoyed observing how they interacted with their surroundings and watching their quirky movements. Over time, Erin grew extremely fond of rodents, especially hamsters, considering them to be fascinating creatures. She cherished the moments she spent holding the hamster, feeling a strong connection to the tiny animal that seemed to trust her. Erin's experience with hamsters transcended the general fondness though; she was knowledgeable about these small animals and was well-versed in their dietary needs and living conditions. She could distinguish between the many different species of hamsters and even gauge their emotional state through a keen observation of their behavior. On the other hand, Rachel was terrified of rodents, including hamsters. Rachel's fear of rodents stemmed from a negative childhood experience. As a young girl, she encountered a family of rats in her home, leaving her with a lasting impression of disgust and alarm. Despite being aware that hamsters were not harmful in any way, Rachel could not shake off her aversion to rodents in general. The mere sight of Erin holding the hamster made Rachel feel anxious and uncomfortable. Rachel's fear of rodents put her in a difficult position, knowing that Erin was genuinely passionate about hamsters and their well-being. Their friendship, however, was strong enough for Rachel to face her fear and provide moral support to Erin whenever needed. Rachel respected Erin's enthusiasm and made an effort to learn about hamsters and understand them better. As time went by, her feelings of uneasiness around Erin's hamster began to diminish marginally, although she still preferred not to hold them herself. Despite their differing feelings on rodents, Erin and Rachel continued to enjoy their friendship while pursuing their unique interests. Erin's love and fascination for hamsters never faded, and she continued to learn more about these animals, hoping to one day have her own pet hamster. Rachel, on the other hand, started taking gentle steps toward overcoming her fear of rodents, realizing that her friendship with Erin was more important than the discomfort she experienced around hamsters. In conclusion, Erin liked holding the hamster more than Rachel did because Rachel was scared of rodents. Their distinct attitudes toward hamsters did not impact their friendship negatively but rather taught them to respect and understand each other's preferences. This experience allowed them both to grow as individuals and build an even stronger bond between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Although it's inferred that an order was given on September 12th, the text doesn't provide explicit details about what that order entailed or who the recipient(s) of this order were.  The speaker does mention their apparent expectation to review an 'accumulated list of questions that were objected to' during their break. And considering the fact that reporters appeared for depositions, we might infer that the speaker has some supervisory role; likely in a legal setting, given the use of terminology such as 'depositions' and 'rule on those questions'.  However, while this suggests some level of authority and responsibility, we can't definitely infer that the speaker provided clear orders to their subordinates on September 12th. This conclusion would be presumption rather than a direct inference, as the text doesn't directly attribute any instructions or directives to be issued by the speaker to subordinates on that specified date.  The flow of information within the text suggests that the speaker expected a certain course of action based on previous communication, but it doesn't provide explicit evidence to conclude that an order was given to subordinate personnel. It would be more accurate to infer that some kind of directive or expectation was communicated, and the speaker assumed a particular outcome, but the specifics of that communication remain unclear based on the details given.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Answer this question please: Which group had fewer people that may become obese? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step. 1.

Article: In eighth grade, I decided to try out for my school musical. I only made it through the first verse  before the drama teacher stopped me. It goes without saying that my Christmas song didn't get me any role. Am I embarrassed? NO. Not just because it was ten years ago, but also because it's such a great story to share. Why? I think the main reason is that admitting mistakes makes you easier to relate to. Interestingly enough, science confirms _ . Researchers have conducted many studies and have concluded that when someone makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way, they are found to be more likeable. In other words, if you're able to do well and then you mess up, it shows your human side. This allows others to connect and relate to you, which in turn makes them like you more. Growing up, I was type of student who had to get straight A's and the type of athlete who always had to perform at the top of the game. The problem was that my standards were so ridiculously high that I was never happy. It was only when I learned to let go and forgive myself for my mistakes that I truly felt relaxed. When one of your close friends or family members makes a mistake, are you quick to forgive and forget? Sadly, many of us often express more sympathy for others than ourselves. With each mistake coming a lesson, you will be better equipped to handle life's challenges going forward. More importantly, if you are always worried about looking silly, you will never be able to get improved. Even if you make a fool of yourself, it isn't the end of the world.

What is the answer to this question? who was the last president that was not a democrat or republican?","output":"The last President of the United States who was not affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican party was Millard Fillmore, the 13th President, who served from 1850 to 1853. Fillmore was a member of the Whig Party when he assumed office following the death of President Zachary Taylor. The Whig Party was one of the dominant political forces in American politics from the early 1830s to the mid-1850s. The party was formed in opposition to the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. In particular, the Whigs supported the supremacy of Congress over the Executive Branch and favored a program of modernization and economic protectionism. Fillmore, originally a lawyer from New York, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1833 to 1843 and was a strong opponent of Andrew Jackson. In 1848, he was elected as Vice President under Zachary Taylor, the 12th President, who was also a member of the Whig Party. However, Taylor died in office on July 9, 1850, and Fillmore assumed the presidency. During his presidency, Fillmore signed the Compromise of 1850 in an attempt to avoid a potential civil war between the North and the South over the issue of slavery. The Compromise was a package of five separate bills passed by U.S. Congress that defused a political confrontation between slave and free states. However, the compromise was fragile and was one of the contributing factors to the eventual Civil War. After his presidency ended in 1853, Fillmore still continued his political career and in 1856, he was nominated for the Presidency by the Know-Nothing Party, more officially known as the American Party, but he did not win the election. So, to sum up, the last U.S. President who was not a Democrat or a Republican was Millard Fillmore. His presidency marked the end of an era as the Whigs fell into disarray and ultimately dissolved in the late 1850s due to divisions over slavery. The Republican Party would be formed in 1854 from the remnants of the Whig Party and others who opposed slavery, leading to the two-party system we know today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If your friend or partner is often reaching out to talk, he probably misses you when you're not around. Everyone has different styles around communication, but frequent phone calls and messages are a good sign of investment in a relationship. When someone misses you, he will sound engaged and eager when you do speak. If your friend sounds distracted when you're catching up after a long time, it may be a sign that he didn't miss you. If you feel anxious or insecure when your partner is away, it's better to be honest about it. Asking, “Did you miss me?” or “Do you still love me?” is unlikely to address your real feelings. If your partner says, “Yes,” you might not believe her, while if she says, “No,” you'll feel even worse. Instead, ask directly for the reassurance that you need. For example, you could say: “I've had a terrible day and I'm feeling pretty lonely and insecure tonight. Can you indulge me with some extra support and tell me that you love me and miss me?” If your friend or partner shares images or links that made her think of you, it means just that: she's thinking of you. When you are not together, you are still in your friend's mind.  Presents are another way of demonstrating caring and engagement. Even if you don't always love the thing a friend or partner got you, recognize that this, too, is evidence that she was thinking about you when you were not together.  If he is eager to tell you about the details of his boring conference or flight connections, recognize that it's probably because he wants to keep talking to you. Sharing mundane details is a way of maintaining connection across distance and shows that he misses you when you are apart. If you are far apart, it may be harder to read the signs of affection in your partner's body. If you can talk by video, look for a tilted head and sustained eye-contact. Over the phone, a softer or higher tone of voice conveys intimacy. Pair bonding between couples means that separation can cause increased stress and anxiety. If she is especially worried or unsettled while you are apart, it may be that she is missing you.

First, we add up all the numbers on the right side of the equation. So, -31*z - 172 - 27 - 235 all together equals -31*z - 434. So our equation becomes: 0 = -31*z - 434. Then, to find 'z', we need to move all the stuff that's not 'z' to the other side of the equation. To do that, we add 434 to both sides, like taking 434 cookies from one side and putting them on the other. This gives us: 434 = -31*z. But we still have that '-31' glued to our 'z'. Since it's multiplication (think of it like -31 groups of z), we do the opposite to get rid of it, which is division. So, we divide both sides by -31 like splitting the cookies into 31 equal groups. That gives us: z = 434 / -31.  And finally, when we do that math, we find that z = -14. For a little extra fun, imagine if you had 14 pieces of candy and then you lost all of them!

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Its exact area is not precisely or consistently defined but varies depending on whether one is taking a linguistic, geographic, socio-cultural or historic standpoint.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - The new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.  - Holy Moses is a German thrash metal band. They are well noted for being fronted by Sabina Classen (it is rare for a woman to be a singer in thrash metal) and for being one of the very first German thrash metal bands.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany. The band is a pioneering force in the power metal genre, and their second and third studio albums, \\"\\" and \\"\\", are considered masterpieces of the genre.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe.  - Sabina Classen (born December 27, 1963 in Aachen as Sabina Hirtz) is a German thrash metal singer, most known as lead vocalist of Holy Moses and Temple of the Absurd.  - Ulrich Kusch ( born 11 March 1967 ) is a heavy metal drummer .

Knowing that he is dying, he sets out with a stolen quantity of PU 239, a weapons grade form of radioactive material.To attempt to make something meaningful come out of the certain end of his life, he sets out for Moscow, where he incompetently attempts to sell the lethal material to who ever can read his hand-held sign, which simply says \\"PU 239.\\" To the civilized mind this scene is more remnicient of the American Wild West than a modern scene in a country as developed as Russia. To sell radioactive material, you just write the product name on a sign and hold it out for everyone on the street to observe? The protagonist does so as innocently as if he were selling vegtables at a roadside stand. As the plot races on, one gets the opinion that Russia IS the Wild west. Life is cheap, very cheap!With that first clumsy attempt at converting the material to cash for his family (wife and young son), he collides with an unimaginative street hood. Together, the dying man, and the incompetent criminal approach multiple other criminals with the offer to make them rich. However, the Biblical warning \\"there is no honor among thieves\\" plays out as the thugs eventually kill first the hood that \\"represents\\" him, and then he, himself.The bullet from the Moscow criminal did not truly kill him, however. The truth is that he was dead from the inception of the story. The product is death on wheels. In the movie, it is referred to as having a 40,000 year half life. Be this as it may, it is not nose candy. However, reaping what he sowed, the man that shot the dying man to death, then stupidly, snorts from the vile, and the story soon ends.

Article: Very few people enjoy exams. I don't, either. And although I tell myself not to worry about them, I always do! So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this? Ask the teacher about how to revise and about exam skills--how to work when you are in the exam. Good students don't wait until the week before an exam. They study all through the year. It is not possible to learn everything at the last minute. So don't leave it till then. If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, \\"What a good exam that was!\\" Take a short rest during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it won't remember well. Work at the time when you know you'll work at your best. If you're studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed afterwards. Your mind will still be \\"going round and round\\"--thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things. If you feel bad, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them.

Although the movie does not explicitly reveal the ultimate fate of Figgus, it is understood that he is among the few survivors who played a role in devising a plan to put an end to the perilous battle between the Alien and the Hunter. His survival or death remains ambiguous, but it is clear that Figgus was instrumental in the group's efforts to escape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: :::SPOILER ALERT::: Soooo, Arnie's really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders, he's sent to jail (or rather some sort of work camp). He escapes, but after a short while he's caught once again. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys. I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arnie-fan and all. However, \\"The Running Man\\" contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats. There are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns. The acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par, with Arnie in the leading role, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad. The special effects are OK, without being impressive. RATING: 3/10","output":"Okay, buddy!

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more finish stays on happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed suggests that if more finish stays on the wood, there would be less or slower weathering occurring. In order to understand the potential effects this change could have on the process, let's break down the steps of the weathering process and explore the impact of the perturbation on each step. 1. Rain falls on wood: Whether more finish stays on the wood or not, rain would still fall on the surface. The perturbation does not directly affect this step. 2. The rain seeps into the wood surface: With more finish staying on the wood, it is more likely that the surface becomes better protected and less porous. As a result, the rain may have more difficulty seeping into the wood surface, which could slow down or reduce the overall weathering process. 3. It permeates the wood: If less rain seeps into the wood surface due to the remaining finish, then the wood has more protection from water damage, leading to slower permeation rates and subsequently less damage. 4. When rain evaporates it leaves the wood: The evaporation process occurs regardless of the finish, but with more finish staying on the wood, it is possible that the rate of evaporation might be slightly altered or reduced. 5. It takes the finish of the wood with it: If more finish stays on the wood, the rate at which the finish deteriorates would decrease. This means the wood would maintain its protective barrier longer, which indirectly contributes to less weathering occurring. 6. The wood begins to lose its luster: As more finish stays on the wood, its protective qualities are prolonged, slowing down the rate at which the wood loses its luster. 7. It begins to look bad: If the wood maintains its finish and luster for a more extended period, its overall appearance would be preserved, contributing to a slower degradation process. 8. It has pieces of paint missing from the rain: Again, with more finish staying on the wood, less paint would be lost due to rain, reducing the rate of weathering. 9. It gets worse when it rains: Since the wood is better protected by the remaining finish, it would not be as susceptible to rapid deterioration when rain occurs. 10. It eventually will have no paint left: Although the perturbation hypothesis slows down the weathering process, the finish will still continue to wear away over time, exposing the paint and wood to environmental factors. However, this would happen at a much slower rate than without the proposed perturbation. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more finish staying on the wood has a direct and indirect effect on the weathering process, mainly through a prolonged protective barrier provided by the finish. This results in slower degradation, allowing the wood to maintain its luster and appearance for a more extended period. However, it does not completely prevent environmental wear and tear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, the training methods employed might surprise some, as the USAF utilizes older aircraft to train pilots for state-of-the-art fighter jets such as the F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor. This article delves into the reasons and advantages behind employing older planes in training today's elite pilots. Training Process When it comes to training the best pilots in the world, hands-on experience is critical. Before recruits take their first flight in an advanced fighter jet, they must complete rigorous training programs in progressively more sophisticated aircraft. The first step is the T-6 Texan II, a single-engine turboprop aircraft, followed by the T-38 Talon, a supersonic jet trainer that has been in use since the 1960s. These older planes serve as a foundation for introducing students to high-speed flight and developing their skills as pilots. Advantages of Utilizing Older Planes While it may seem counterintuitive, there are numerous advantages to employing older planes for training purposes. 1. Cost-Effectiveness: Maintaining and operating older aircraft are significantly more affordable than their modern counterparts. With a growing defense budget, it is important to conserve resources where possible. Using older planes saves on costs that can be allocated to other crucial areas within the defense sector. 2. Gradual Progression: The complexity of modern fighter jets could be overwhelming for inexperienced pilots. Older planes ensure that pilots have a strong foundational understanding of flight mechanics before advancing to more technologically advanced aircraft. By mastering the skills and techniques required to fly older models, they can translate their knowledge into effectively handling state-of-the-art jets. 3. Reliability and Durability: Many older aircraft, such as the T-38 Talon, have proven their reliability over decades of service. These planes have undergone countless modifications and upgrades, making them more rugged and dependable. As a result, they remain an excellent choice for preparing pilots for the strenuous demands of advanced combat missions. 4. Enhanced Training: Older planes may lack the sophisticated avionics and weapon systems found in newer fighters, but they allow pilots to hone their basic flying skills. This hands-on experience gives pilots the ability to quickly adapt to new situations and maintain focus under pressure, which is essential when operating modern fighter jets. Challenges and Solutions Despite the advantages of using older planes in training, there are some challenges that the USAF must overcome. These include maintaining and modernizing older aircraft, as well as ensuring that pilots receive adequate training on the advanced systems found in modern fighters. To address these concerns, the USAF has introduced simulators to supplement hands-on training with older planes. These simulators mimic the cockpit and systems of advanced fighter jets like the F-35 and F-22. Combining simulator training with experience in older, more basic aircraft allows pilots to gain a comprehensive understanding of the systems and techniques unique to modern fighters. Conclusion The United States Air Force continues to train its pilots for the most advanced fighter jets by using older planes in combination with cutting-edge simulation technology. This balance of learning in an older and simpler platform, along with high-tech simulators, prepares pilots for the rigors and demands of operating state-of-the-art aircraft. Furthermore, training with older planes offers cost-effective advantages, as well as invaluable hands-on learning experiences. In the end, this blend of tried-and-true methods and modern innovation ensures that the USAF maintains its reputation for excellence as its pilots continue to master the skies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.

Think of it like this: you have -15 apples, then someone gives you 55 apples, and then you get 5 more apples. To find out how many apples you have in total, you add all the apples together: (-15 * p) + (55 * p) + (5 * p) -15 apples + 55 apples + 5 apples = 40 apples + 5 apples = 45 apples So, if we rewrite the equation, we get: -495 = 45*p Now, let's find out how many times 45 should be multiplied to get -495. In other words, we'll divide -495 by 45: -495 ÷ 45 = -11 So, if you take the number 45 and multiply it by -11, you get -495. That means p equals -11.

London topped the list for rides and runs with over 10 million activities logged in the last year. \\"We've analysed billions of GPS data points and millions of activities to give a never-seen-before insight,\\" said Strava co-founder Davis Kitchel. The \\"Strava Insights\\" project revealed that nearly 10,000 bike or run commutes - journeys within the morning and evening rush-hour windows - are logged in London every day, four times as many as San Francisco and Amsterdam, the cities second and third respectively on the commutes list. However, London's population is about 10 times the size of those two bike-friendly cities, although London's numbers do compare well to cities of similar sizes, such as New York, Sydney, Berlin and Paris. Analysis of all logged activities show Tuesday is the most popular day for a bike ride in every city apart from Sao Paulo (Wednesday). According to the results, Amsterdam residents ride the fastest (15.9 miles per hour on average), those in Milan cycle the furthest (33.7 miles) and Parisians run the fastest (eight minutes 56 seconds per mile). The figures also show that users in Sydney ride or run the earliest, Sao Paolo residents exercise latest, and those in Barcelona have the toughest terrain to contend with. Strava, which was launched in 2009, uses global-positioning-satellite technology to record rides and runs, allowing users to compare their performances against other users. The San Francisco-based company does not reveal its total membership but claims it is growing by 100,000 new users every week.

In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers.

He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was.  \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face.

He was raised in Missouri where he worked in his father's store while attending school. This was his first retailing   experience and he really enjoyed it. After graduation, he began his own career as a retail merchant. He soon opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Wal-Mart specialized in name brands at low prices and Sam Walton was surprised at the success. Soon a chain of Wal-Mart stores sprang up across rural America. Walton's management style was popular with employees and he founded some of the basic concepts of management that are still in use today. After taking the company public in 1970, Walton introduced his \\"profit sharing plan\\". The profit sharing plan was a plan for Wal-Mart employees to improve their income dependent on the profits of the store. Sam Walton believed that \\"individuals don't win, teams do\\". Employees at Wal-Mart stores were offered stock options   and store discounts. These benefits are commonplace today, but Walton was among the first to implement   them. Walton believed that a happy employee meant happy customers and more sales. He also believed that by giving employees a part of the company and making their success dependent on the company's success, they would care about the company. By the 1980s, Wal-Mart had sales of over one billion dollars and over three hundred stores across North America. Wal-Mart's unique decentralized   distribution system, also Walton's idea, created the _ needed to further encourage growth in the 1980s during growing complaints that the \\"superstore\\" was stopping smaller and traditional stores from developing. By 1991, Wal-Mart was the largest US retailer with 1,700 stores. Walton remained active in managing the company, as president and CEO until 1988 and chairman until his death. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom shortly before his death. A:","output":"What significant action did Sam Walton introduce in 1970 to improve employee income and foster company success? A) Introduced a strict hierarchy system B) Established a profit-sharing plan C) Implemented forced unpaid overtime D) Created a centralized distribution system"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Remy posted flyers to the event they were going to put on.  And I was wondering Why did Remy do this?","output":"To determine why Remy posted flyers for the event, I will gather information and consider possible reasons. Here are my steps: Step 1: Analyze the purpose of flyers Flyers can be a powerful and cost-effective form of advertising, promoting a cause or an event to a wide audience. They are tangible forms of communication and support engagement with the target audience. Step 2: Identify the event in question I need to know the details of Remy's event to understand the reasons behind using flyers for promotion. The event might be a party, concert, community gathering, or workshop. Knowing the event type helps to understand Remy's goals and objectives, which are essential for finding the reason. Step 3: Understand Remy's objectives I will consider Remy's possible objectives. They might want to raise awareness, attract attendees, build a community, or seek donations. By aligning these objectives with the benefits of using flyers, I can better understand why they chose this method. Step 4: Identify Remy's target audience Remy might choose to use flyers to reach specific demographics or areas. By analyzing the target audience, I can conclude if posting flyers makes sense in that context. Step 5: Consider alternatives Before concluding, I will consider if Remy had alternative promotional options like social media, email, or online advertising and why they chose flyers instead. After completing these steps, I can make a well-informed assumption about why Remy posted flyers for their event: Remy likely chose to use flyers because of their cost-effectiveness and the ability to reach a wide audience in a tangible manner. The event may be a local one, making physical advertising more suitable than digital methods. Alternatively, Remy might want to target specific demographics or neighborhoods that would be best reached by distributing flyers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: – Danny Pintauro, who played Jonathan on Who's the Boss?, revealed a big secret when he went on Oprah Winfrey's Oprah: Where Are They Now? \\"I wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but I wasn't ready—I'm ready now—that I'm HIV-positive, and I have been for 12 years,\\" said Pintauro, 39, per the Hollywood Reporter. The former child star came out as gay in 1997. \\"It's just a big deal,\\" he said of his diagnosis. \\"It's not something that people are talking about right now really,\\" and he hopes to be a role model for others with HIV. (Pintauro got married last year.)","output":"Title: Danny Pintauro: Breaking Stereotypes and Living with HIV Danny Pintauro, famously known for his role as Jonathan on the hit sitcom \\"Who’s the Boss?\\", gave the world a surprising and deep revelation when he appeared on Oprah’s show titled \\"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\\". Confessing a long-kept secret, the one-time child actor revealed, \\"I wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but I wasn’t ready—I'm ready now—that I'm HIV-positive, and I have been for 12 years.\\" Born on January 6, 1976, Pintauro first garnered fame in the late 1980s through his role in “Who’s the Boss?”. A versatile actor at a young age, he carried his talent forward in TV and film, capturing audiences with his boyish charm and impressive acting skills. However, the news he shared on Oprah's show offered a glimpse into the more profound struggles that the now 39-year-old actor has had to face. Per the Hollywood Reporter, Pintauro, who first acknowledged his sexual orientation to the public back in 1997, revealed that he has been living with HIV for over a decade. While this news may have initially raised eyebrows, it also served to underscore the critical elements of living with HIV: maintaining personal strength and battling social stigmas. Given the often misconstrued and sensationalized image of HIV and AIDS in media and public discourse, Pintauro’s confession was received as a brave move. He captured the complex emotions associated with his health status when he stated, \\"It's just a big deal.\\" He further acknowledged that even though people might not be explicitly discussing HIV at the moment, it remains a significant health issue globally. What Pintauro hopes to achieve through revealing his diagnosis represents another facet of his courage. Instead of shying away from the implications of his health condition, he wants to use his status as a public figure to shed light on HIV, to diffuse the stigma surrounding it, and to support those similarly affected. By harnessing his fame and exposure, Pintauro aspires to be a role model for others in the same situation. He further strives to show that being HIV-positive does not imply a ‘death sentence’, but instead, it means living a life encompassing diligence, safety precautions, and advanced medical care. Pintauro’s life hasn't stopped with his HIV diagnosis. On the contrary, he's been living a wholesome life and even got married the year before his big revelation. This shows that the former child star is not allowing his diagnosis to define him, but rather, he's thriving, striving, and living his life to the fullest despite it. His story thus serves as a powerful source of inspiration for others. It is indicative of the fact that while HIV is a life-altering condition, it does not have to dictate the course of one's life. In conclusion, Danny Pintauro's brave admission about being HIV positive has initiated significant dialogue about the condition and its associated stigmas. It's a testament to Pintauro’s resilience that he has taken a potentially limiting condition and transformed it into a platform for educating others, for empowerment, and for inspiring hope among many. He is indeed a modern warrior fighting against the societal prejudices surrounding HIV and an inspiration for those living with the condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, the reviewer mentions two negative factors: one, that the Bear Family CD is cheaper - the implication is that the current product is overpriced or at least not cost-effective compared to other options.  Secondly, the reviewer calls out the lack of stereo sound on the CD, stating, \\"There is no reason for this mono transfer.\\" They put this as another significant downside since the album was recorded in a time when stereo was at its peak, indicating that the product is not meeting the expected standards. Lastly, they end with a negative recommendation, advising other potential buyers to \\"Stick with the Bear Family CD,\\" which they note is in STEREO and contains twice the music.

Here's what we have: -90 * w + 482 = -2085 - 673 First, let's add 2085 and 673, the big and small negative numbers, or as I like to call them, the grumpy numbers! -2085 - 673 = -2758 Now our problem looks like this: -90 * w + 482 = -2758 Next, let's make sure our grumpy number (-2758) is by itself. We'll do that by moving the happy number (+482) to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 482 from both sides: -2758 - 482 = -3240 So, now we have: -90 * w = -3240 Now, we just need to find out what w is. We will do that by dividing both sides by the number attached to w, which is -90. Remember, when you divide two grumpy numbers (-90 and -3240), you get a happy number! -3240 / -90 = 36 So, our answer is: w = 36 Good job, little buddy!

Context: \\"Hey, guy.\\" \\"No, this is Ray.\\" He smiled, leaned back in his chair. It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Options: A: doesn't like snow B: wants to take his car out of the garage C: wants to keep the road clean D: often tells the man to do something A:","output":"The correct answer is \\"B: wants to take his car out of the garage\\". As per the context provided in the article, Mr. Smith approached a man to clean the road from his garage to the gate. This action was motivated by Mr. Smith's intention of taking his car out, and not simply due to an aversion to snow or a desire to keep a clean road. The text doesn't indicate that Mr. Smith often tells men to do something, ruling out option D. Hence, it can be inferred that the reasoning behind his request to the man was driven by his need to use his car and ensure it wasn't inhibited by the accumulated snow blocking the pathway from his garage to the gate. Therefore, upon analyzing the information provided in the article, it is evident that Mr. Smith instructed the man to clear the road from his garage to the gate as he desired to use his car, i.e., he wanted to take his car out of the garage.

Given the question: Given the background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  and the situation: Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.  Answer the following question: Which scientist read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest? The answer is:","output":"Jian.  Justification: Given the information in the scenario, we can deduce that Jian, who studied the grassland soil, would have less knowledge about the principal source of organic matter in forests. The details specify that these two different ecosystems have distinct primary contributors to their organic matter: for grassland, it's from fibrous, grass root systems, while for forests, it's largely from fallen tree leaves. Since Jian focused on grassland soil, it's reasonable to infer that Jian might not have read as much about forest soil and its organic matter sources compared to Yun who examined forest soils."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 9, 2018      Trump has long directed his ire at the news media, and has floated ideas such as canceling the daily press briefings at the White House and opening up libel laws to make it easier to sue news outlets and reporters.      Taking away press credentials, however, would be unprecedented and would drastically restrict correspondents' access to the White House grounds and press briefings, among other things.      The White House Correspondents' Association itself came under fire late last month after Talev issued a statement denouncing comedian Michelle Wolf's performance at the annual White House correspondents' dinner. Critics, including many journalists, accused the organization of hypocrisy for criticizing the comedian while claiming to defend free speech. ||||| The liberal media’s war against President Trump was as fierce as ever during the first four months of 2018, but the onslaught appears to be for naught: In the face of massive and hostile coverage from ABC, CBS and NBC, Trump’s overall job approval rating actually rose, from 37 percent in mid-December to roughly 43 percent at the end of April.      The Media Research Center studied all broadcast evening news coverage of the President from January 1 through April 30, and found 90 percent of the evaluative comments about Trump were negative — precisely the same hostile tone we documented in 2017.      But unlike last year, when the RealClearPolitics average depicted a slow but steady erosion in the President’s job approval numbers, the public has apparently warmed to Trump in 2018, even as the networks are as frosty as ever.      For this report, MRC analysts examined all 1,065 network evening news stories about President Trump and top members of his administration during the first four months of this year. The coverage totalled a whopping 1,774 minutes, or roughly one-third of all evening news airtime.      (For comparison, in 2015 and 2016, coverage of President Obama amounted to just ten percent of all evening news airtime.)      Nearly two-fifths (39%) of the TV coverage we examined focused on Trump scandals and controversies, while 45 percent was devoted to various policy issues. The remaining airtime was spent on controversies involving other top Trump officials, such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, or did not involve specific topics.      The Russia “collusion” story was given by far the most airtime — 321 minutes, or nearly one-fifth of all Trump administration coverage. The legal battle involving porn star Stormy Daniels, as well as allegations against the President involving other women, ate up another 92 minutes of airtime.      Network coverage of those topics, plus a host of other smaller controversies involving the President, was almost entirely negative: of the 598 statements we tallied about Trump’s personal controversies or scandals, virtually all of them (579, or 97%) were negative.      (As always, our analysis of “spin” tracks only explicitly positive and negative statements from reporters and non-partisan sources; it excludes neutral statements as well as statements from partisans such as Trump praising himself or Democrats criticizing him.)      When it came to policy matters, the President fared somewhat better — but only in contrast. Of the 542 opinionated statements involving a policy matter, 440 (81%) were negative, compared with 102 (19%) which were positive.      The policy stories earning the most TV airtime in 2018 were immigration (167 minutes), the economy (117 minutes), North Korea (111 minutes), Syria (89 minutes) and gun rights (57 minutes). The networks’ spin on immigration, Syria and gun rights was extremely negative (between 88% and 96% negative). And, despite the potential of a breakthrough with North Korea, the coverage of that topic was tilted two-to-one against the President (68% negative vs. 32% positive).      The President’s handling of the economy was a mixed bag. A majority of the networks’ airtime (66 minutes) was devoted to Trump’s decision to impose tariffs and threaten a wider trade war with nations such as China, an aspect of economic policy which drew mostly criticism (90% negative spin).      But the remaining airtime (51 minutes) consisted of mostly positive coverage (73% positive) for the rest of Trump’s economic agenda: job growth, tax reform, deregulation, and plans for more infrastructure spending. Yet this coverage has amounted to less than three percent of TV’s total coverage of the President this year.      The positive economic story is probably one reason why the public has rewarded Trump with higher approval ratings, despite the bad press. Another is that the public’s trust in the media has been eroding for years, which means that journalists are less credible critics than they might have been years ago.      There’s no precedent for a President receiving such a sustained level of negative press over such a long period of time. The fact that the public has become more favorable towards the President in this environment is the latest sign that the media watchdog’s bite isn’t as menacing as their bark suggests. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Summarize the following: Take the hand you want to make the peace sign with, and hold it in front of you, open palmed, with your palm facing away from your body.  Rake your fingers, excluding your pointer and middle finger, and fold them into your palm like you are making a fist. Make sure your thumb is over your other fingers. Raise your index and middle fingers. The index finger is the closest finger to your thumb. It doesn’t matter which hand you use. This is how you make the standard peace sign with your hand, Your extended index and middle fingers should form a “V.” Keep your clenched fingers and palm pointed away from your body. This is very important.  When you keep your palm facing inward toward yourself, the gesture can be perceived as offensive in some cultures, almost a double middle finger. Make sure you put your pointer finger and your middle finger out at the same time. If you put your middle finger out first it can mean something very bad in English (and in many other languages). Don't stick out your little finger; this, too, has an alternate, obscene interpretation. When done correctly, the peace sign became a counter-cultural symbol of peace in the Vietnam War.  Most people raise their hand in the air while making it.  Some people consider the meaning of the symbol to be a call for an end to war, and some people think of it as a general call for peace in the world. Some politicians have made the sign with both hands while raising both arms (Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower). This can be a cliche, though, that brings to mind Nixon. Many people just raise one arm when making the sign. When some people see the peace sign, they think of it as a “V” sign that means victory, especially in war. The V sign is also made by holding up the two fingers closest to the thumb in a V formation.  It doesn’t matter which hand you use. Allied troops started using this hand sign to indicate victory during World War II.  Winston Churchill used the sign to indicate victory. So did Nixon, in the context of Vietnam. Protesters who were against Vietnam then started using the same sign and saying “peace” as they did it instead, to protest the war. They wanted to change the hand gesture to a symbol of peace. The point is to be aware that the hand signal has both a history in the anti-war movement and in representing victory during war. This sign is another hand signal that derived from the television show, Star Trek. Its meaning is “live long and prosper.”  To make it, press together the two fingers closest to your thumb at the same time you press together the two fingers farthest away from your thumb. The middle of your hand will form the “V” shape when you do this with your fingers. You should keep your thumb extended outward as you do so. Historically, the Vulcan was a pagan deity, a sun god who was linked to powerful energy such as thunderbolts. Summary:","output":"To make the standard peace sign with your hand, hold it open palmed facing away from your body, fold all fingers except the pointer and middle finger into your palm, and raise your index and middle fingers. The peace sign, with its origins in countercultural anti-war movements and World War II victory gestures, can be interpreted differently depending on the context and the way the palm is facing.

He eventually decides that his family's happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins, who later smugly fires him. Dejected, Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan, whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy. The answer to this question is:","output":"Elliot Hopper is the one Curtis thinks is ordering him to stop the taxi.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Long bus rides are like television shows. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end with commercials   thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. \\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\" \\"Drink Good Wet Root Beer.\\" \\"Fill up with Pacific Gas. \\"Only when you have fallen asleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, can you get separated from the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" As for the ride itself, the beginning of it is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless   or daring, the ride can be as thrilling   as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that. The seat, of course, has become harder for the hours having passed. By now you may sit with your legs crossed, or with your hands in your lap, or with your hands on the arms, or even with your hands crossed behind your head. That is to say that the end comes just at no more ways to sit. Question: The writer feels long bus rides are like TV shows because   _  . - the commercials both on TV shows and on billboards along the road are fun - they both have a beginning, a middle and an end, with commercials in between - the drivers are always reckless on TV shows just as they are on buses - both traveling by bus itself and watching TV programs on bus are not exciting.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who scored the first touchdown of the game?","output":"Title: Who Scored the First Touchdown of the Game? Hey there little buddy! Today, we're going to talk about a really fun and exciting part of a football game - scoring touchdowns! A touchdown happens when a player carries the football across the other team's goal line or catches it there. This scores points for their team and gets everybody cheering! Now, you want to know who scored the first touchdown of the game, right? To find this out, we would need to know which game you are asking about because there are soooo many football games happening all the time. Each game features two teams, and one of these teams will usually score the first touchdown. Sometimes, it could be a big strong player who runs really fast, or it could be someone who catches the ball while jumping super high! It's always fun to hear the crowd go wild when this happens. Here's what you can do to find out who scored the first touchdown of the game you are asking about: 1. Ask a grown-up who watched the game or knows about it, like your mom, dad, or big brother/sister. They might remember the player's name, or even better, they might tell you an exciting story about how it happened! 2. Look it up on the internet with the help of an adult. You can search for the names of the two teams that played and the date the game happened. This should give you some information about the game, including who scored the first touchdown. 3. Watch highlights from the game on TV or online. Watching video highlights is lots of fun because you get to see all the best parts of the game, including the first touchdown! Just ask a grown-up to help you find them and enjoy the action together. Remember, each football game is unique and different, and that's what makes them so exciting to watch. The player who scored the first touchdown in one game may not be the same in another game. But it's always fun to learn more about football and the amazing players who score those exciting touchdowns! I hope you find the answer you're looking for, and you get to see many amazing touchdowns in the future!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Paragraph: Several arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease with case-fatality rates in hospitalized individuals ranging from 15-30%. Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens. Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-a) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal. However, while cIFN-a has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production. To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replicationdeficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-a, for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters. Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichindé virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease. A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure. The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-a, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections. The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.

The company has previously called on the government to take stronger action against resale sites. Ie:music has not responded to repeated requests for a statement. Ticketmaster, which owns Get Me In and Seatwave, said the tickets - which it describes as \\"platinum\\" tickets - on the sites were \\"priced according to demand, in consultation with our clients, the event organisers\\". Tickets on Ticketmaster for seats on level one, block 126 - for Robbie Williams's gig at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, on Friday 2 June 2017 - were found by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme to be priced at £95, before fees. But on Get Me In, for \\"platinum\\" seats on level one, block 125, at the same gig, seats were priced at £160 before fees - £65 more expensive. Because the tickets came straight from the artist's management team, all the profit goes directly to them. A statement from Ticketmaster said: \\"Platinum tickets are a very small percentage of the best seats in the house that are priced according to demand, in consultation with our clients, the event organisers. \\"The UK live events industry has been successfully using platinum for many years so that the full value of these tickets goes back to the rights holders and not to resellers.\\" In November 2015, Williams's management, ie:music, signed a petition saying: \\"We as artist, managers and agents deplore the increasing industrial-scale abuse and insider exploitation of tickets for music, arts and sports events by ticket touts, and their online associates and facilitators.\\" They wanted the government to take stronger action against resale sites. Promoter Harvey Goldsmith said the position Williams's team were taking made him \\"angry\\". \\"I think it is wrong, but hopefully most of the people who have signed the [2015] petition are acting honourably and are doing everything that they can do to prevent tickets being sold on the secondary market,\\" he said. Conservative MP Andrew Bingham, part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said that \\"somehow, [touts] have worked a way round of abusing this [resale] system\\". He said it appeared that some artists' management teams were \\"now also complicit in it as well\\". In December, the Competition and Marketing Authority announced it was to investigate the resale ticketing market, to ensure sales were complying with consumer rights laws. A representative of Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball and Summertime Ball confirmed they had placed tickets for both those events directly on StubHub, but added they had not increased the prices. The Victoria Derbyshire programme also found resale websites StubHub, Get Me In and Seatwave were providing specialist software - which could be used by touts - to enable users to sell large volumes of tickets through their platforms. To sign up for StubHub's software, StubHub Pro, users have to show they have sold more than 50,000 (£40,000) worth of tickets in a year. The software allows users to sell tickets in different currencies, as well as in volume. StubHub has not responded to requests for a statement. Ticketmaster said its software, Ticket Utils, was not available in the UK. Both have previously spoken out against computer programs known as \\"bots\\", which have long been cited as a major problem in helping touts buy large volumes of tickets ahead of the general sale to fans. In Italy, the country's lawmakers have moved to ban secondary ticketing, after a media investigation found evidence that Live Nation Italy was selling thousands of tickets directly on Viagogo at higher prices. In a previous statement to Billboard Magazine, Live Nation Italy said the allegations related to a \\"small number of tickets, for a handful of international artists\\". Neither Viagogo or Live Nation UK have responded to repeated requests for a statement. Andy Inglis, an artist manager from 5000 management, called the practice \\"morally bankrupt\\". \\"I just think artists should answer to their fans more,\\" he said. \\"There should be more accountability. \\"But I guess when the artists get bigger, they are more removed from their fans. \\"So I think you can more easily set aside your ethics and charge what you want.\\" Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

What is the answer for the question: What was the 2001 population count of the town that was a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing? from the following article ?  Neilston (Scots: Neilstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Nèill, pronounced [paləˈnɛːʎ]) is a village and parish in East Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000...

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water. Examples of detritivores include earthworms and catfish. You can see another example in Figure below .   Q: What is the term for decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris collected on the ground or at the bottom of water?   Choices:  - scavengers  - recyclers  - consumers  - detritivores  A: Answer:","output":"The term for decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris collected on the ground or at the bottom of water is detritivores. These organisms play a crucial role in breaking down and recycling organic matter within ecosystems. They help to convert dead plant and animal material into simpler compounds, which can then be utilized by other organisms within the ecosystem. This process contributes to nutrient cycling and maintaining overall ecosystem health. Detritivores differ from scavengers in that they primarily feed on dead or decomposing organic matter, whereas scavengers typically consume the remains of dead animals. While both groups contribute to decomposition, they target different types of organic matter. Examples of scavengers include vultures, hyenas, and some species of beetles. Recyclers, though not a specific ecological classification, can be thought of as a broad term that encompasses both detritivores and scavengers. They are organisms that help recycle nutrients by breaking down organic material and returning it to the ecosystem in a form that other organisms can use. Consumers, on the other hand, are a more general category in ecology, comprising all organisms that obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter. This category is further divided into primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores and omnivores), and tertiary consumers (apex predators). Detritivores can be considered a type of consumer, but their specific role in breaking down and recycling organic matter sets them apart from other consumers. In summary, the answer is detritivores, as they are the decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris collected on the ground or at the bottom of water. Their important role in breaking down and recycling organic matter helps maintain nutrient cycling and overall ecosystem health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people with a criminal mind-set would do their utmost to break out of a police station, however, not all see it that way. Michael Naughton, 24, was caught doing quite the opposite when he was arrested for allegedly attempting to break in to a police station. Mr Naughton was seen ‘violently pulling’ a locked door at a downtown Boston Police station at 2.30 in the morning. Breaking into the law: Michael Naughton, 24, was arrested for allegedly attempting to break in to a police station in downtown Boston. Naughton, from Somerville, Boston, was discovered as he made his way through the garage door. He then entered a secured area inside the District A-1 station on Tuesday morning and confronted several police officers. According to officers, Naughton became ‘belligerent and yelled at the officers to get out of his house,’ CBS Boston reported. Despite being informed several times that he was inside a police station, Mr Naughton kept shouting his address and argued with the officers. Naughton entered District A-1 Boston police station through a garage door and yelled at officers to 'get out of his house' Police officers were forced to handcuff him after a short struggle after which he was placed in custody. He was arrested and eventually charged with breaking and entering in the nighttime and resisting arrest. A court appearance date has yet to be announced.

Panel Says The United Nations said on Thursday that the Islamic State has committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq and Syria. GENEVA — Islamic State forces have committed genocide and other war crimes in a continuing effort to exterminate the Yazidi religious minority in Syria and Iraq, United Nations investigators said on Thursday, urging stronger international action to halt the killing and to prosecute the terrorist group. The investigators detailed mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam, saying they were shot in the head or their throats were slit, often in front of their families, littering roadsides with corpses. Dozens of mass graves have been uncovered in areas recaptured from Islamic State and are being investigated. The investigators have produced 11 reports documenting wide-ranging crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by many parties to the five-year-old civil war in Syria, but in a report released on Thursday, they invoked the crime of genocide. They based their findings on actions taken by the Islamic State since August 2014 against 400,000 members of the Yazidi community, followers of a centuries-old religion drawing on many faiths. “Genocide has occurred and is ongoing,” Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, chairman of the panel, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, said in a statement. “ISIS has subjected every Yazidi woman, child or man that it has captured to the most horrific atrocities,” he told reporters in Geneva, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “ISIS permanently sought to erase the Yazidis through killing, sexual slavery, enslavement, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forcible transfer causing serious bodily and mental harm.” Those acts, he said, clearly demonstrated its intent to destroy the Yazidi community in whole or in part. More than 3,200 Yazidi women were still being held by Islamic State fighters, mostly in Syria, the panel found. “The crime of genocide must trigger much more assertive action at the political level, including at the Security Council,” Mr. Pinheiro said, calling for the case to be referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, or to another international tribunal. “Nothing has been done to save these people, and we hope for stronger action by the international community,” Mr. Pinheiro said, highlighting the obligation for countries under the 1948 genocide convention to take action to prevent it. The report compiled by the panel — based on interviews with survivors, religious leaders, smugglers and medical personnel, among others — had identified individuals responsible for acts of genocide and provided “a road map for prosecution,” said Carla Del Ponte, a Swiss lawyer on the commission and a former prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The commission on Syria has repeatedly recommended referral of the crimes to the International Criminal Court, but no action has followed from the Security Council, where Russia, a permanent member and the closest ally of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, wields a veto. The commission had collected names and details of perpetrators and had shared information with some national authorities, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a Thai legal scholar on the commission, who called the report “a wonderful gift” to the five permanent members of the Security Council “so that they can consider acting together.” Secretary of State John Kerry said in March that the United States had determined that Islamic State had committed genocide against Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims, but Andrew Clapham, an international law professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said the rigorous analysis presented by the commission of inquiry would carry more legal weight. The Yazidis came to broad public attention after Islamic State fighters captured Mount Sinjar, in northern Iraq, in 2014 and engaged in systematic slaughter. Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook Sinjar last fall. Mass killings were only part of the Islamic State’s systematic campaign to eliminate the Yazidi community, the panel found, citing documents that revealed careful planning for treatment of the community after it was overrun and a “massive organizational effort” to coordinate the actions of fighters across Iraq. “ISIS made no secret of its intent to destroy the Yazidis of Sinjar, and that is one of the elements that allowed us to conclude their actions amount to genocide,” Ms. Del Ponte said. In addition to the killings, Islamic State fighters systematically separated Yazidi men and women and carried out rape, sexual mutilation and sterilization to prevent the birth of Yazidi babies, and they transferred captured Yazidi children to the fighters’ families and training camps, cutting them off from Yazidi beliefs and practices and “erasing their identities as Yazidis.” The panel reported in harrowing detail the acute trauma experienced by women and girls as young as 9 who were sold off as spoils of war to become sex slaves of Islamic State fighters, routinely raped and punished with extreme violence if they resisted or tried to escape. Islamic State fighters often targeted younger Yazidi children as a means of punishing their mothers, the report said. It cited an account of a fighter who killed several children after their mother’s effort to escape failed: The mother was then beaten and raped because she cried over their deaths. “No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,” the report said.","output":"The United Nations has said that ISIS committed and is still committing genocide against the Yazidi people, an ancient religious minority in Iraq and Syria. ISIS has been trying to wipe out the Yazidis by killing the men and boys, turning women into sex slaves, horrible acts of torture, and kidnapping and brainwashing children. Over 3,200 Yazidi women are still being held by ISIS fighters mostly in Syria. The United Nations is asking for stronger international action to stop and punish ISIS for these terrible acts against the Yazidis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2006, U2 started work on the follow-up to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), collaborating with producer Rick Rubin. After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases. He said, \\"We're gonna continue to be a band, but maybe the rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get a lot harder. But whatever it is, it's not gonna stay where it is.\\"Rubin encouraged a \\"back to basics\\" approach and wanted the group to bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, \\"we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's in the process of recording that we really do our writing.\\" Bassist Adam Clayton said, \\"once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in.

This will ensure you are prepared and can complete the task efficiently. Step 2: Choose an option From the given options: Option 1 - Mix sugar, eggs, flour, and peanut butter in a bowl with a whisk. Option 2 - Mix sugar, eggs, flour, and peanut butter in a saucepan with a whisk. I would recommend choosing Option 1, as mixing the ingredients in a mixing bowl is the standard procedure for making cookie dough. Mixing the ingredients in a saucepan (Option 2) is not ideal because cookie dough is not typically cooked on the stovetop and it's easier to mix the ingredients in a larger and more open container, such as a bowl. Step 3: Mixing the ingredients Follow Option 1: Mix the sugar, eggs, flour, and peanut butter in a bowl with a whisk or a spatula. Start by creaming together the sugar and room temperature softened butter first, then add the eggs and mix well. Next, stir in the peanut butter, followed by the flour. Mix until the dough is well-combined. Step 4: Chill the dough Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This step will allow the dough to firm up, making it easier to handle and shape into cookies. Step 5: Preheat the oven Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) before baking the cookies. This ensures a consistent temperature throughout the baking process.

Dr Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for the charity, said more than 97% of meadows had been destroyed in England since the 1930s, with road verges becoming the last stretches of natural habitat for wildlife such as bees and other insects. \\"Most of our farmland is now hostile to many of our wild plants and other wildlife due to the loss of wild flower meadows and the use of herbicides and fertilisers,\\" he told BBC News. \\"The roadside verges are often the last refuge for wild flowers and the wildlife there depends on them. \\"It's almost as if plants have been squeezed out of farmland and now they're being squeezed out of road verges from bad management.\\" The Local Government Association has said keeping road verges well-maintained means motorists have a good line of sight and allows pedestrians to walk more safely alongside busy roads. Plantlife International says road verges are of particular importance to rare plants such as Deptford pink, tower mustard and spiked rampion. They also act as wildlife corridors and provide pollen and nectar for bees, butterflies and moths. The wild plant conservation charity says many of Britain's road verges are being cut down in full flower threatening the wildflowers and the wildlife that depends on them. It is calling on members of the public to sign a petition urging councils to do more to enhance the wildlife value of road verges. Its management principles for road verges include: Dr Dines added: \\"If we just give them a chance, wildflowers can return.\\" Follow Helen on Twitter.","output":"Plants that used to grow in meadows now mostly live by roads where they help insects, but some are in danger because people cut the plants too early, making it hard for them to survive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Il est souvent complexe de mesurer les objectifs et les insuffisances de financement dans divers contextes, tels que les projets, les organisations et les initiatives. Cette difficulté provient généralement de plusieurs facteurs, dont la variabilité des contextes et des besoins, l'évolution des objectifs fixés, et les incertitudes liées aux approvisionnements financiers. Les objectifs se réfèrent aux buts que les organisations, les entreprises ou les individus souhaitent atteindre. Ils peuvent être très spécifiques ou larges, varier en fonction du domaine ou de l'activité concernée et changer au fil du temps. Dans certains cas, il peut être simple de mesurer le progrès vers la réalisation d'un objectif, par exemple, en comptabilisant le nombre de clients, de ventes ou de projets achevés. Cependant, il est souvent difficile de quantifier ces objectifs, car ils peuvent être très diversifiés et multidimensionnels, impliquant de multiples aspects et indicateurs. Le financement est également un facteur critique dans la réalisation des objectifs, car les projets et les initiatives ont besoin de ressources et de soutien financier pour être menés à bien. Toutefois, les sources de financement et les opportunités peuvent varier sensiblement, ce qui complique l'évaluation des pénuries de financement. Les causes possibles de ces pénuries incluent les contraintes budgétaires, les changements dans les priorités gouvernementales ou privées, les cycles économiques et les fluctuations financières. Pour résoudre ce problème, les organisations devraient se concentrer sur une meilleure planification et un ciblage plus précis, tout en demeurant flexibles et ouverts à l'apprentissage et à l'adaptation. De plus, il est essentiel pour les organisations de rechercher et de mobiliser diverses sources de financement, de peaufiner leurs stratégies de financement et de faire preuve de transparence et de responsabilité dans la gestion de leurs ressources. Il est crucial de développer des outils et des méthodologies pour quantifier les objectifs et identifier les pénuries de financement. Cela peut inclure la création de indicateurs clés de performance (KPI), l'élaboration de plans stratégiques et opérationnels, les études de faisabilité, les recherches sur les sources de financement et les partenariats possibles, et la mise en place de systèmes de suivi et d'évaluation.

String cheese, made from mozzarella, has a stringy texture due to the way the cheese proteins line up during the production process. Here's a detailed guide on how to separate string cheese: 1. Choose your string cheese: First and foremost, select a good quality string cheese. It's best to go for a mozzarella-based cheese that is specifically marketed as \\"string cheese\\" because these are designed to be easily peeled. 2. Prepare a clean surface: Make sure you have a clean surface to work with, and that your hands are clean too. It will help ensure that the cheese remains fresh and untainted by unwanted substances. 3. Remove the wrapper: Carefully remove the plastic wrapper that encases the cheese. Be gentle to avoid damaging or squashing the cheese as it can affect the stringing process. 4. Examine the cheese: Look for a seam or any hint of a starting point. Most string cheese has a noticeable edge or a split between the strings. If there's an indentation or a natural \\"V\\" shape in the cheese, you could utilize it as the starting point for peeling. 5. Hold the cheese: Grasp the cheese firmly in one hand near the top. It's essential to have a firm grip so that the cheese doesn't slip while you're peeling away the strings. 6. Begin peeling: Use your other hand's thumb and index finger to gently grip the seam or edge of the cheese. Start pulling the cheese apart in the direction of the seam or indentation, slowly separating a string from the main body of the cheese. 7. Apply gentle pressure: As you separate a string, apply gentle, even pressure as you pull it away from the rest of the cheese. The goal is to create thin, even strings and not to break them off abruptly. You may need to adjust your grip and the angle at which you're pulling to maintain consistent pressure as you separate each string. 8. Continue pulling strings: Work your way around the cheese, gently but firmly pulling each new string away from the main body. Ideally, you should be able to create numerous strings that vary in length and thickness, depending on your preference. 9. Monitor your progress: As you go, check to ensure that the cheese is separating evenly and isn't tearing or breaking off in chunks. If you encounter any difficulties, adjust your grip, pressure, or angle to better separate the cheese. 10. Enjoy your string cheese: Once you've successfully separated the desired number of strings, it's time to enjoy your cheese! Be sure to store any remaining, unpeeled cheese in a sealed container to keep it fresh for future snacking. It's worth mentioning that practice makes perfect. The more you separate string cheese, the better you'll become at achieving the ideal thickness and length of the strings. Moreover, each cheese stick may have slightly different textures and stringiness, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't perfect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Q:As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years.

I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.  Question: \\"What languages spoken by the different attorneys of Neighborhood Legal Services?

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra\\" correctly answer the question \\"What attracted bigger vessels to the island?\\"? Options are: - no; - yes;","output":"- yes; The response \\"Sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra\\" correctly answers the question \\"What attracted bigger vessels to the island?\\" because it tells us that the harbor in Melaka was safe and protected from the strong winds and rain, making it an ideal location for large ships to come and trade. The other option, \\"no,\\" is not correct because the text clearly states that the sheltered harbor was a major reason why bigger vessels came to the island."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information:  - Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901  28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the \\"architect of the nuclear age\\" and the \\"architect of the atomic bomb\\". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics.  - Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity.  - Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\".  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects.  - Oscar D'Agostino ( 29 August 1901 -- 16 March 1975 ) was an Italian chemist and one of the so - called Via Panisperna boys , the group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi : all of them were physicists , except for D'Agostino , who was a chemist . In 1934 he contributed to Fermi 's experiment ( that gave Fermi the possibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1938 ) to showing the properties of slow neutrons . That led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission , and later on to the construction of the first atomic bomb .  - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: \\"I ragazzi di Via Panisperna\\") were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb.  - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders?  The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi....

One day, we were walking in our hometown and saw hundreds of cigarette butts on the ground. They made the town look so ugly that we decided to start a group to make people stop dropping butts. We called it \\"No Butts About It\\". At first, we drew pictures with \\"The Earth is Not Your Ashtray \\" written on them. We put the pictures around our hometown---in parks, by beaches, and along roads. We wanted to make people understand that dropping butts hurts the environment.

Chris Austin Hadfield  (born 29 August 1959) is a retired Canadian astronaut who was the first Canadian to walk in space. An engineer and former Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot, Hadfield has flown two space shuttle missions and served as commander of the International Space Station. Hadfield, who was raised on a farm in southern Ontario, was inspired as a child when he watched the Apollo 11 Moon landing on TV. He attended high school in Oakville and Milton and earned his glider pilot licence as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. Hadfield attended White Oaks Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario until his senior year and then graduated as an Ontario Scholar from Milton District High School in 1977. As a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, he earned a glider pilot scholarship at age 15 and a powered pilot scholarship at age 16. After graduating from high school in 1978, he joined the Canadian Armed Forces and spent two years at Royal Roads Military College followed by two years at the Royal Military College, where he received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1982. Before graduating, he also underwent basic flight training at CFB Portage la Prairie. In 1983, he took honours as the top graduate from Basic Jet Training at CFB Moose Jaw, and then went on to train as a tactical fighter pilot with 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, flying the Canadair CF-116 Freedom Fighter and the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet. After completing his fighter training, Hadfield flew CF-18 Hornets with 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying intercept missions for NORAD. He was the first CF-18 pilot to intercept a Soviet Tupolev Tu 95 long-range bomber in the Canadian Arctic.  In the late 1980s, Hadfield attended the US Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base and served as an exchange officer with the US Navy at Strike Test Directorate at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. His accomplishments from 1989 to 1992 included testing the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft; performing research work with NASA on pitch control margin simulation and flight; completing the first military flight of F/A-18 enhanced performance engines; piloting the first flight test of the National Aerospace Plane external burning hydrogen propulsion engine; developing a new handling qualities rating scale for high angle-of-attack test; and participating in the F/A-18 out-of-control recovery test program.  In May 1992, Hadfield graduated with a master's degree in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee Space Institute, where his thesis concerned high-angle attack aerodynamics of the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet. In total, Hadfield has flown over 70 different types of aircraft.

Process: - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode -   Question: suppose there is a global war happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A global war can have significant consequences on an animal's ability to hibernate properly, potentially increasing the challenges and threats it faces during this critical period of energy conservation. In such a scenario, the negative impact on hibernation is likely to be more pronounced, leading to the selection of option A: more. Several factors contribute to the heightened difficulties for animals during hibernation amid a global conflict: 1. Destruction of natural habitats: Warfare often brings about widespread destruction of the environment, whether through direct combat operations or the secondary effects of military activity. This can lead to the obliteration of essential animal habitats, making it challenging for them to find secure and suitable locations to hibernate. 2. Increased noise and human presence: The hustle and bustle of war can lead to elevated levels of noise pollution and an increase in human presence around animal habitats. This can be particularly detrimental to the hibernation process, as excessive noise and disruption can disturb an animal's ability to enter and maintain a hibernative state. 3. Scarcity of food resources: Large-scale conflicts can lead to the disruption of food supply chains, affecting the availability of adequate nourishment for animals. As hibernation is an energy conservation mechanism that relies on an animal's ability to store fat, a lack of sufficient nutrition in the run-up to hibernation can severely hamper an animal's chances of surviving the winter months. 4. Pollution and environmental changes: War can result in pollution of natural habitats as well as changes to local ecosystems, which can have a myriad of detrimental effects on all species within the vicinity. For animals preparing to hibernate, this may alter their ability to find proper hibernation sites with the necessary environmental conditions. 5. Escalated stress levels: Animals exposed to the stressors associated with warfare may be unable to enter the deep relaxation state necessary for hibernation. Chronic stress can result in hormonal changes that could make it difficult for an animal to hibernate properly, as the physiological and behavioral processes involved are disrupted. In conclusion, a global war can greatly harm an animal's ability to hibernate properly. The destruction of habitats, increased noise and human presence, scarcity of food resources, pollution, and higher stress levels all contribute to the challenges faced by animals entering hibernation during times of war. Consequently, the correct answer to the question of how a global war could affect an animal's hibernation process is A: more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\"?

Information:  - Epicurus (or  \\"ally, comrade\\"; 341270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher as well as the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus's 300 written works remain. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators.  - Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippusabout whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that what he called \\"pleasure\\" was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\\"ataraxia\\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\\"aponia\\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \\"hedonism\\" as it is colloquially understood.  - Themista of Lampsacus , the wife of Leonteus , was a student of Epicurus , early in the 3rd century BCE . Epicurus ' school was unusual in the 3rd century , in that it allowed women to attend , and we also hear of Leontion attending Epicurus ' school around the same time . Cicero ridicules Epicurus for writing \`\` countless volumes in praise of Themista , '' instead of more worthy men such as Miltiades , Themistocles or Epaminondas .

Although Price claimed his birth was in Shropshire he was actually born in London in Red Lion Square on the site of the South Place Ethical Society's Conway Hall. He was educated in New Cross, first at Waller Road Infants School and then Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School. At 15, Price founded the Carlton Dramatic Society and wrote plays, including a drama, about his early experience with a poltergeist which he said took place at a haunted manor house in Shropshire. According to Richard Morris, in his recent biography Harry Price: On 4 February 1922, Price with James Seymour, Eric Dingwall and William Marriott had proven the spirit photographer William Hope was a fraud during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his SPR report \\"William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter ... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.\\"  Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of Spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope's original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials.  Price later re-published the Society's experiment in a pamphlet of his own called Cold Light on Spiritualistic \\"Phenomena\\" - An Experiment with the Crewe Circle. Due to the exposure of Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism. Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from his laboratory and claimed if he persisted to write \\"sewage\\" about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Houdini. Doyle and other spiritualists attacked Price and tried for years to have Price take his pamphlet out of circulation. Price wrote \\"Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for years for exposing Hope.\\"  On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Eileen J. Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a seance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident. The event \\"attracted worldwide attention\\", thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further seances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the seances:  It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her subconscious mind or those of the sitters. \\"Spirit\\" or \\"trance personality\\" would be equally interesting explanations - and equally remarkable. There is no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment.  Garrett's claims have since been questioned. The magician John Booth analysed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth Garrett's notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints by a technician from the airdrome. However, the researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett's seances were \\"either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\\"  In 1931, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research took on its most illustrious case. PS50 was paid to the medium Helen Duncan so that she could be examined under scientific conditions. Price was sceptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test seances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as \\"ectoplasm\\". Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth. Duncan reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. Price wrote that Duncan had given her fake ectoplasm to her husband to hide. The ectoplasm of Duncan in another test was analysed by psychical researchers and reported to be made from egg white. According to Price:  The sight of half-a-dozen men, each with a pair of scissors waiting for the word, was amusing. It came and we all jumped. One of the doctors got hold of the stuff and secured a piece. The medium screamed and the rest of the \\"teleplasm\\" went down her throat. This time it wasn't cheese-cloth. It proved to be paper, soaked in white of egg, and folded into a flattened tube ... Could anything be more infantile than a group of grown-up men wasting time, money, and energy on the antics of a fat female crook.  Price wrote up the case in Leaves from a Psychist's Case Book (1933) in a chapter called \\"The Cheese-Cloth Worshippers\\". In his report Price published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audience were spirits. Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted the ectoplasm materialisations to be the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again pretending to be a spirit in the seance room. During Duncan's famous trial in 1944, Price gave his results as evidence for the prosecution. This time Duncan and her travelling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.

After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building. Lieutenant Thơ, who had earlier urged Diệm to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle Đỗ Mậu, along with Đính and Khiêm, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later \\"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\\".

During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo.

Please answer the following question: Article: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or refresh them during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to drinking coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy', which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong noise, taking in unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The tasteless caffeine spray is absorbed through the skin and spread through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that lasts longer than drinking a cup of coffee. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: \\"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized  by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

Q: The simplest example of what type of 'organ system' is the gastrovascular cavity found in organisms with only one opening for the process?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Invertebrate Digestive Systems Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion. Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the “mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity. The alimentary canal, shown in Figure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.

This Finnish sentence translates to the mentioned statement in English. It talks about the necessity of judgment over the exercise of control or power, particularly emphasizing that it should reside with competent or authorized individuals or bodies. This sentiment often relates to discussions over governance, corporate power, or political discourse.  In essence, this idea advocates for the control or power within an organization, be it government bodies, corporate sectors, or any influential institution, it shouldn't be unrestricted. There should be an authoritative body, presumably someone neutral, competent, and unbiased, who would judge or assess the usage of this power. The purpose of such arrangement would be to ensure checks and balances, to prevent misuse of power, and to maintain fairness and justice.

Q:Information:  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.  - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.  - Roussillon (or ; ) is one of the historical counties of the former Principality of Catalonia, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French \\"département\\" of Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees). It may also refer to \\"Northern Catalonia\\" or \\"French Catalonia\\", the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it.  - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule.  - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.  - Languedoc-Roussillon  is a former administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it is part of the new region Occitanie. It comprises five departments, and borders the other French regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées on the one side, and Spain, Andorra and the Mediterranean Sea on the other side. It is the southernmost region of mainland France.  - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba.  - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian.  - Languedoc ( Occitan: \\"Lengadòc\\" ) is a former province of France. Its territory is now contained in the modern-day region of Occitanie in the south of France. Its capital city was Toulouse. It had an area of approximately 27,376 square kilometers (10,570 square miles).  - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\".  - Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for \\"Gaul of Narbonne\\", from its chief settlement) was a Roman province located in what is now Languedoc and Provence, in southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (\\"our Province\\"), from its having been the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (\\"Transalpine Gaul\\"), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Its boundaries were roughly defined by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Cévennes and Alps to the north and west. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania.  - Arius (250 or 256336) was a Christian presbyter and ascetic of Berber origin, and priest in Baucalis in Alexandria, Egypt. His teachings about the nature of the Godhead in Christianity, which emphasized the Father's divinity over the Son, and his opposition to what would become the dominant Christology, Homoousian Christology, made him a primary topic of the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in 325.  - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire.   - Septimania (  ) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (\\"Marca Gothica\\").  - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood.  - Arianism, in Christianity, is a Christological concept that asserts that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was created by God the Father at a point in time, is distinct from the Father and is, therefore subordinate to God and not the same as. Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius (c. AD 250336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the prevailing theological views held by proto-orthodox Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. The Arian concept of Christ is that the Son of God did not always exist but was created by God the Father.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half.  - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania.  - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis.  - Reccared ( or Recared ; Latin : Reccaredus ; Spanish : Recaredo ) I ( c. 559 -- 31 May 601 ) ( reigned 586 -- 601 ) was Visigothic King of Hispania , Septimania and Galicia . His reign marked a climactic shift in history , with the king 's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Chalcedonian Christianity in 587 . Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife Theodosia . Like his father , Reccared had his capital at Toledo . The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians , while the Hispano - Roman population were Roman Catholics . The Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild , Hermenegild , to Catholicism . Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role . When King Leovigild died , within a few weeks of April 21 , 586 , bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo . The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition . In January 587 , Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism , the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania . Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example , certainly those around him at Toledo , but there were Arian uprisings , notably in Septimania , his northernmost province , beyond the Pyrenees , where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc , who had the reputation among his Catholic enemies of being virtually a second Arius . Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection , the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy , who saw his opportunity and sent his dux Desiderius . Reccared 's army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter , Desiderius himself being slain . The next conspiracy broke out in the west , Lusitania , headed by Sunna , the Arian bishop of Mérida , and count Seggo . Claudius , Reccared 's dux Lusitaniae , put down the rising , Sunna being banished...  - Theodoric II (Gothic: Þiudareiks II), \\"Teodorico\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, (426  early 466) was the eighth King of Visigoths from 453 to 466.  - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created.

Continue the following story. Elena always took more cake than Tanya, as","output":"the older sister, and she wholeheartedly enjoyed taking full advantage of her seniority. One sunny afternoon, Tanya brought in a freshly baked chocolate cake from the kitchen, setting it down onto the table. The aroma of the warm, velvety cake filled the room, and even though Tanya felt a bit annoyed at the prospect of Elena eating more than her, she couldn't resist the feeling of joy and pride that came from baking such a delightful treat. Elena entered the room with a bright smile, her eyes immediately fixed on the cake. The two sisters sat at the table, eagerly preparing to dig in. \\"Remember, I'm older, so I get more cake than you,\\" Elena said with a cheeky grin, as she grabbed the knife to cut herself a generous slice. Tanya's eyes narrowed, but she remained silent. Just this once, she thought, I want to have as much cake as Elena, if not more. As time went by, Tanya grew increasingly more tired of the cake divide. She might have been the younger sister, but she was also the one who put the most effort into making the cakes. The hours spent perfecting the recipes, decorating them immaculately, and adding that little touch of magic, were all her own. One day, she had an idea. While she was leafing through a new cookbook, she stumbled upon a recipe for magically transforming cream. The cream, when properly charmed, would grow in quantity whenever someone tried to take away more than their fair share. If Elena tried to take more, the cream would replenish the cake piece for Tanya, ensuring equality in every bite. Tanya decided to put this magical method of fairness to the test, carefully following the recipe to enchant the cream in the book. She spent hours perfecting her new creation, a beautiful raspberry and vanilla cream cake. She presented the cake at dinner, watching Elena's eyes widen with delight. As usual, Elena reached for the knife and attempted to cut a larger slice for herself than for her younger sister. However, the moment she attempted to place the disproportionate slice on her own plate, something marvelous happened. The cake piece on Tanya's plate grew to match the size of Elena's. The enchanted cream had worked! Elena looked at Tanya in shock, then at the cake quizzically. In turn, Tanya couldn't help but smile, knowing she had finally found a way to enjoy her own creations equally. From that day on, the sisters enjoyed fair shares of cake. Elena, in time, began to appreciate the hard work and love poured into every delicious pastry Tanya baked and understood that her younger sister deserved an equal slice of happiness. This magical cream not only equalized their dessert servings but brought them closer as sisters, teaching them the value of sharing and appreciating one another's efforts. The enchanted cream's recipe eventually became a family secret, passed down through generations always reminding them that the best moments of life are truly sweeter when they are shared fairly among family and friends. And as for Tanya, she continued to bake the most delightful cakes, using her newfound magic to teach others the importance of kindness, fairness, and a love for the sweeter things in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bernie Sanders and billionaire Donald Trump have won the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries in New Hampshire, in victories so decisive that the drama of primary night shifted to the Republicans battling for second, third and fourth place.      Projected to finish in second was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a relatively moderate candidate who might face a difficult time unifying the party behind him in the next few primary states. After Kasich, there was a close race for third between Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) — who won the Iowa caucuses last week — and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.      Behind all of them was Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who had been seen as the strongest challenger to Trump until a disastrous debate performance on Saturday, in which New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie attacked Rubio and the senator responded by repeating the same talking point over and over.      But if Christie’s attack had hurt Rubio, it didn’t seem to have helped Christie himself: Christie was running behind Rubio, last among the four “establishment” candidates.      The results for his challengers seemed to be a good one for Trump, since it was likely that a large number of them would continue on to the next primaries, dividing the voters who want to see Trump defeated.      Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders thanked supporters for high voter turnout after winning the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. (Reuters)      [New Hampshire primary election results]      In the Democratic race, Sanders was projected as the winner over former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who had been seen as her party’s prohibitive favorite a year ago.      “Nine months ago, we began our campaign here in New Hampshire, we had no campaign organization. We had no money. And we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America,” Sanders said to his supporters. “And tonight, with what it appears to be a record-breaking voter turnout, because of a huge voter turnout – and I say YUGE! – we won,” Sanders said, poking fun at the New York City accent he shares with Trump. The crowd had yelled “YUUUGE!” along with him.      Sanders said that the enthusiasm his supporters showed in New Hampshire could be replicated in other primaries and in a general election, with a strongly left-wing message drawing out new voters who’d be left unenthused by a centrist.      “That is what will happen all over this country!” Sanders said.      Sanders is a self-identified “democratic socialist,” originally little known outside Washington and his home state of Vermont. But he built a massive movement with rousing attacks on the power of Wall Street, and a promise of a “political revolution” that would provide universal, government-run health insurance and free public-college tuition.      Sanders was also helped by Clinton’s struggles to explain why she’d used a private email server to handle government business while she was secretary of state, a scandal that has hung over her candidacy for months.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses ecstatic supporters following his win in the New Hampshire primary. (Reuters)      “Now we take this campaign to this entire country. We are going to fight for every vote in every state,” Clinton told supporters after conceding. She then returned to a constant theme of her campaign, which was that she — unlike Sanders — was ready for the long slog that politics demands. “People have every right to be angry. But they’re also hungry. They’re hungry for solutions.”      Clinton’s defeat in New Hampshire was so resounding – and so long anticipated – that Clinton’s campaign conceded immediately when the polls closed at 8 p.m. The campaign sent out a statement downplaying the importance of New Hampshire, which Clinton won in 2008. Her campaign promised to fight on through March, including the next-up contests in Nevada and South Carolina. The next states, Clinton’s campaign said, would be more likely to turn out her way.      [New Hampshire primary live updates:]      “Whereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation,” Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the statement. Clinton’s campaign has said it expects to do far better among African American and Latino voters than Sanders will.      Exit polls reported by CNN showed that Sanders had beaten Clinton across a wide variety of demographic groups — including women, who voted for Sanders by a margin of 55 percent to 44 percent.      Sanders also won decisively among self-identified independents, taking that group by 72 percent. The two candidates evenly split voters who identified themselves as Democrats. Sanders also won all the ideological groups that the polls surveyed: Democratic voters calling themselves “very liberal,” “somewhat liberal,” and “moderate” all preferred him to Clinton.      Another telling detail: Clinton won handily among the voters who said the quality they wanted most in a candidate was “electability.” Her advantage among that group was 81 percent to 18 percent. But Sanders dominated in the group that said the most important quality was that the candidate “cares,” and in the group that said it was most important that the candidate was honest. In the group that cared about honesty, Sanders won by 92 percent to 6 percent, according to CNN.      Among Republicans, Trump’s victory — even though it had been predicted for weeks — is still a remarkable turnabout. Last summer, Trump had seemed like an afterthought in a race that seemed likely to be dominated by former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and the massive campaign warchest assembled to back Bush.      But Trump’s TV experience made him a commanding figure in early debates, where other candidates seemed unsure how to handle a candidate who insulted their looks and told them to shush. And Trump’s blunt message, which promised a massive wall on the southern border and a program to deport 12 million undocumented immigrants, resonated with voters who felt their party had ignored the issue for too long.      “We are going to do something so good, and so fast, and so strong. And the world is going to respect us again. Believe me,” Trump said to supporters, during a speech that began with Trump thanking his late parents. Trump then reviewed a series of campaign promises, including his plan to build a wall on the southern border. “We’re going to build a wall. It’s going to be built. It’s not even, it’s not even a difficult thing to do.” He also said he would be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.”      The crowd chanted “Trump! Trump! Trump!”      “That’s so beautiful,” Trump said.      In a moment that captured so much of this campaign, Trump’s speech happened at the same time as Bush’s own speech, and largely kept Bush – projected a year ago as the race’s favorite – off the air.      For Trump, the victory here in New Hampshire was a vindication of his unusual campaign style, which favored huge rallies and free TV exposure over the kind of data-driven, expensive voter-turnout efforts that mark most modern campaigns.      In Iowa, Trump used that approach and lost to Cruz and his high-tech “ground game.” But in New Hampshire, it was enough.      Trump’s approach is likely to be tested further in the upcoming contests in the South, starting with South Carolina’s primary on Feb. 20 and turning a week later to a group of “Super Tuesday” states.      One of the big New Hampshire surprises was Kasich, a pragmatic Midwesterner whose candidacy has been an afterthought nationally but who steadily built a pitch-perfect campaign for this state that roused mainstream voters with high visibility on the ground and a call to lift up people in the shadows.      Kasich told supporters Tuesday night that his second place finish was evidence an optimistic message could win.      “There’s magic in the air with this campaign,” Kasich said. “We never went negative, because we have more good to sell.”      The Ohio governor called on supporters to join his effort “to re-shine America. To restore the spirit of America. And to leave no one behind.”      But the race now moves south, where Kasich faces immediate hurdles to prove he is more than a one-state wonder and where Trump has found deep and enthusiastic support for his incendiary nationalistic platform. Cruz is well positioned to contend with Trump for the top spot in those states because of his broad coalition of movement conservatives and evangelicals.      Republican exit polls reported by CNN showed how dominant Trump’s victory in New Hampshire had been. Trump won among people who said they had been “betrayed by Republican politicians” – but also among those who didn’t feel betrayed.      Trump won both men and women, won the married and the unmarried, won college graduates and non-graduates, won high earners and low earners, and won both those who called themselves “conservative” and among those who called themselves “moderate/liberal.”      The few sub-groups that Trump did not win included those who called themselves evangelical or born-again: Cruz won that group with 24 percent. But his victory in that group – a core part of Cruz’s support – came by just a single percentage point. In second place, with 23 percent, was Trump. Kasich won among voters who said they were “somewhat worried” about the economy, though Trump won the group that said they were “very worried.” Trump lost among the voters who believed “electability” was the most important quality in a candidate: they went for Rubio.      One striking statistic in the poll came from a question that asked voters about what should be done with undocumented immigrants who were already in the U.S. Trump has said he would deport all 12 million of them. It was no surprise, then, that Trump won among the voters who supported mass deportation.      But he also won among voters who said that deportation was the wrong choice. Among that group of voters – the 66 percent of Republicans who supported offering legal status to undocumented immigrants, the exact opposite of Trump’s plan – 22 percent supported Trump anyway. That was enough to tie Kasich for first place.      The exit polls reported by CNN showed that 66 percent of Republican primary voters supported another idea that Trump has praised: a temporary ban on Muslim foreigners entering the U.S. In that group, not surprisingly, Trump was the most popular candidate, with 42 percent support.      For Republicans, the campaign trail in the final push was like a game of political billiards — with attacks flying fast and in all directions, reflecting the jumbled field and the uncertain fates that await so many of the candidates.      Bush fired at Trump, Cruz, Kasich and Rubio. Christie savaged Rubio. Rubio smacked back. Trump, for his part, slammed Bush and Cruz.      Tuesday night, Bush told his supporters, “The pundits had it all figured out last Monday night when the Iowa caucuses were complete. They said the race was now a three-person race between two freshmen senators and a reality TV star. And while the reality TV star’s still doing well, it looks like you all have reset the race.”      Recalling the story of a veteran he met who had been wrongfully declared dead by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bush said, “Just like he’s not dead, this campaign’s not dead – we’re going on to South Carolina.”      For the Republicans, the character of the race appeared to change over the weekend after a Saturday debate in which Rubio faltered in the face of stinging barbs from Christie.      In an uncharacteristically blunt fashion, Rubio on Tuesday night blamed himself for his poor showing in the primary.      “Our disappointment tonight is not on you -- it’s on me. I did not do well on Saturday night. So listen to this: that will never happen again,” he vowed.      Late Tuesday, Christie seemed sobered by his defeat – and contemplating an end to his campaign. Before Tuesday’s results were in, Christie had said he planned to campaign in South Carolina, extending his campaign to the next primary state. Now, he said, he would return to New Jersey, and watch for the final results from New Hampshire.      “That’s going to allow us to make a decision about how we move from here in this race. But there’s no reason to sit in a hotel in South Carolina to hear that,” Christie said.      While in New Jersey, he said, “We can actually get a change of clothes, which would be a nice thing.”      If Christie does drop out because of New Hampshire, that would mark the end of a long decline for one of the most talented retail politicians in the race. Christie had once been the front-runner in New Hampshire, way back in 2014, but he was un-done by a scandal from his own administration – in which aides allegedly caused a traffic jam on a major bridge in order to punish a local mayor who hadn’t endorsed Christie’s re-election.      And he was out-shone by Trump, who stole away the role that Christie had sought to play: the race’s brash straight-talker.      Eilperin and Fahrenthold reported from Washington. Jose A. DelReal in Portsmouth, Jenna Johnson, Sean Sullivan and John Wagner in Concord, Michael Kranish in Plaistow, Abby Phillip, Anne Gearan, Ed O’Keefe and Karen Tumulty in Manchester contributed to this report. ||||| Bernie Sanders thrashed Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, an emphatic early triumph for a populist campaign long dismissed as an afterthought in the Democratic presidential primary.      The Vermont senator's dominant performance in his neighboring state could force Clinton's team to reassess its operations and solidify Sanders' candidacy as a serious threat for the nomination.      Story Continued Below      \\"The people of New Hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment, the economic establishment and by the way, to the media establishment,\\" Sanders said in his victory speech. \\"What the people here have said is that given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for the same-old, same-old establishment politics and establishment economics. The people want real change.\\"      He warned his supporters that his win could augur an uglier phase of the race. “They are throwing everything at me but the kitchen sink, and I have a feeling that kitchen sink is coming soon,\\" Sanders said.      With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Sanders led Clinton 60 percent to 38 percent. Sanders' senior strategist, Tad Devine, told POLITICO it “was, we believe, the biggest margin of victory in a contested Democratic primary in history.\\"      Clinton sought to signal a new stage of her campaign as it looks to regroup for the March contests, which feature more diverse electorates that should aid her cause.      \\"It's not whether you get knocked down that matters, it's whether you get back up,\\" she told supporters after calling Sanders to concede. She echoed many of Sanders' campaign themes — vowing to crack down on Wall Street, push for campaign finance reform and fight for women's rights, gay rights and workers' rights — but said that she could actually produce results.      “Now we take this campaign to the entire country,\\" she declared. \\"We’re going to fight for every vote in every state. We’re going to fight for real solutions to make a difference in people’s lives.”      But the New Hampshire results were so convincing that the race was called as soon as the last polls in the state closed, and Sanders supporters were still making their way into Concord High School for his watch party. Cheers erupted and music blared when TVs showed him as the winner.      \\"Nine months ago, if you told somebody that we would win the New Hampshire primary, they would not have believed you,\\" Sanders wrote in a fundraising appeal to supporters asking for 3 a pop. \\"Not at all. Too bold, they would have said. Not enough money to compete against the billionaires. You showed them tonight.\\"      In her own message to supporters, Clinton wrote that she \\"[wished] tonight had gone differently.\\"            \\"But I know what it's like to be knocked down -- and I've learned from long experience that it's not whether you get knocked down that matters. It's about whether you get back up,\\" she wrote.      The Clinton campaign released a separate memo Tuesday evening mapping out the candidate's way forward.      \\"The nomination will very likely be won in March, not February, and we believe that Hillary Clinton is well positioned to build a strong – potentially insurmountable – delegate lead next month,\\" campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the memo, which touted the importance of next month and Super Tuesday in particular.      The campaign also emphasized Clinton's strength among Hispanic and African American voters, as well as her broader appeal beyond Iowa and New Hampshire.      \\"Additionally, as the campaign moves to states with a heavier presence of military personnel and veterans, Sen. Sanders should expect renewed questions about his foreign policy proposals and preparedness to be Commander-in-Chief,\\" Mook wrote, also pointing to the campaign's \\"data-driven operation\\" to get out the vote in the months to come.      \\"We believe that Hillary’s unique level of strength among African Americans, Hispanics, women and working families of all backgrounds – combined with the most data-driven and targeted campaign ever waged – will net the delegates in March needed to put her on a clear path to the nomination,\\" he wrote in the memo.      Exit poll data from NBC News suggested that 55 percent of primary voters had made up their mind before last month, while just 23 percent said they had waited until the last few days. CNN's exit poll data showed similar results.      Earlier Tuesday, Devine told MSNBC's \\"MTP Daily\\" that the margin of victory was important.      “Yes, I mean I think if we have a substantial victory, that will help us even more,\\" he said, noting the importance of bringing in younger and independent voters.\\"I think that’s an important case that we’d want to prove,\\" he added.      Moments earlier, Mook told Chuck Todd that their operation is prepared for an \\"uphill climb\\" after Tuesday's primary.      Eight years ago, after a humbling third-place Iowa finish, Clinton staged a come-from-behind win in New Hampshire that rescued her campaign. This time, Clinton eked out a win in Iowa, but New Hampshire never looked nearly as kind to her.      For his part, Sanders achieved a bit of history with his victory, becoming the first Jewish candidate to win a primary, something that previous contenders such as Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter and Milton Shapp were unable to achieve.      The high stakes for both sides in the first-in-the-nation primary have been on glaring display all week long.      In their first head-to-head debate last Thursday in Durham, New Hampshire, the two candidates dropped the comity of the first four debates for a bruising, two-hour rumble. In one memorable clash, Sanders attacked Clinton over her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs; Clinton responded that her rival was leveling a \\"very artful smear\\" of corruption against her: \\"Enough is enough,\\" she admonished. \\"If you've got something to say, say it.\\"      Since then, though, Clinton has been on the defensive. After being asked at the debate whether she would release transcripts of her paid speeches, at first she said that she would \\"look into\\" it, but then struck a less amenable tone. “Let everybody who’s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them,” Clinton told ABC. “We’ll all release them at the same time.”      Generational and gender tensions between the two candidates' supporters grew more pronounced over the weekend. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem declared to Bill Maher that young women are only supporting Sanders because \\"the boys are with Bernie,\\" then later apologized. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a Clinton surrogate, trotted out her maxim, \\"There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.\\" Sanders disavowed a group of supporters calling themselves \\"Berniebros,\\" saying, \\"Anybody who is supporting me and doing sexist things, we don't want them.\\"      Former President Bill Clinton got into the act, too, denouncing Sanders (without mentioning him by name) as \\"the champion of all things small and the enemy of all things big.”      Clinton had tried to tamp down expectations, saying some pundits have argued she would have been better off skipping the state. On Saturday, both candidates took brief detours from campaigning in the state: Clinton went to Flint, Michigan, to address the water crisis; Sanders traveled to New York City for a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit with his spot-on impersonator, Larry David.      Gabriel Debenedetti contributed reporting from Concord, New Hampshire. ||||| Beyond Mr. Trump, four Republicans were clustered together, each receiving less than 20 percent of the vote. Mr. Kasich’s surprise second-place finish was driven by voters who described themselves as moderates and independents and were charmed by his pragmatism and his upbeat campaign. Effectively skipping Iowa, Mr. Kasich spent 62 days in New Hampshire, holding 106 town-hall-style events.      “We never went negative because we have more good to sell than to spend our time being critical of somebody else,” an ebullient Mr. Kasich told supporters, vowing “to reshine America, to restore the spirit of America and to leave no one behind.”      But as striking as Mr. Kasich’s surge may have been, the fall of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida may have been more significant. Mr. Rubio initially appeared to be capitalizing on his strong finish in Iowa, rising in the polls here, but a disastrous debate performance on Saturday halted his momentum. Mr. Rubio; Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who won the leadoff Iowa caucuses; and Mr. Bush, whose campaign was all but left for dead after a series of poor debate performances and staff cutbacks, were bunched together.      Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey finished a disappointing sixth after staking his campaign here. With little money left and a slim chance of being eligible for a Republican debate on Saturday, the governor said he was going back to New Jersey on Wednesday “to take a deep breath.” Supporters of Mr. Bush, who formed an alliance with Mr. Christie here as both sought to diminish Mr. Rubio, are lobbying him to endorse the former Florida governor.      Mr. Trump’s win is the biggest victory in a New Hampshire Republican primary since at least 2000. He won pluralities of both Republican and independent voters, and showed strength across demographic groups. At an exuberant victory party at a banquet hall in Manchester, people waved foam fingers reading “You’re hired!” or “Make America great again!” Mr. Trump’s remarks ranged from emotional expressions of thanks to his late parents to more belligerent assertions that echoed his stump speech.      “I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” vowed Mr. Trump, adding that he would “knock the hell out of ISIS,” or the Islamic State. ||||| MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders looked to emerge from Tuesday's New Hampshire primary with their first victories of the 2016 presidential election, while rivals hoped a state famous for political surprises would give their own White House bids a needed boost.      Even if Republican Trump or Democrat Sanders were to stumble, the two were assured of moving on. However, for some GOP candidates, the outcome could determine whether their campaigns continue beyond the northeastern battleground. A trio of governors — Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Chris Christie — have spent most of their time in the state in recent weeks and needed to show voters, as well as crucial financial donors, that they're viable candidates.      \\"This is my 72nd day in the state,\\" Christie, the New Jersey governor, said during a campaign stop Tuesday. \\"I think I've done enough to do well here.\\"      The governors believe their prospects were helped by Marco Rubio's rocky debate performance last week, which they say exposed the Florida senator as too inexperienced to serve as president. However, it was unknown heading into Tuesday's contest whether voters would shy away from Rubio or help him make the case that he's best positioned to take on Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.      If Rubio and the governors finish in a pack, it's likely to frustrate Republican Party elites who are eager to coalesce around a single candidate to challenge Trump and Cruz, whom they believe could be unelectable in November.      Nearly half of voters in the Republican primary made up their mind in the past week, according to early exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the Associated Press and the television networks. Republican voters were more negative about their politicians than Democrats, with about half of GOP voters saying they felt betrayed by party officials.      In a sign of Trump's impact on the race, two-thirds of GOP voters said they support a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., a position the billionaire outlined last year amid rising fears of terrorism emanating from the Middle East.      Among Democrats, Sanders has maintained a sizeable advantage over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire for weeks. The state is friendly territory for the senator from neighboring Vermont and a must-win if he's to stay competitive with Clinton as the race moves to more diverse states that are seen as more hospitable to the former secretary of state.      \\"If we have a large voter turnout I think we're going to do just fine,\\" Sanders told reporters as he took a walk around Concord Tuesday afternoon.      Clinton started her day at a Manchester polling site, where she thanked volunteers and local supporters.      \\"This is a great process, and as I have said over the last couple of days we're going to keep working literally until the last vote is cast and counted,\\" she said. Clinton's campaign was hoping to narrow the gap with Sanders in New Hampshire, a state where she pulled off an unexpected victory over Barack Obama eight years ago.      Democratic voters in New Hampshire made their choices earlier than Republicans, with more than half saying they decided more than a week ago, according to the exit polls. About 7 in 10 Democrats said they wanted a candidate who has experience in politics; about a quarter wanted someone outside the political establishment.      The enthusiasm behind Trump, a real estate mogul who has never held political office, and Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, underscores the public's anger with the current political system. Even if neither candidate ultimately becomes his party's nominee, whoever does will have to reckon with the voter frustration they've tapped into.      For Trump, New Hampshire is his state to lose. After a second place finish behind Cruz in Iowa last week, he accepted some of the more traditional trappings of presidential campaigns, including smaller town halls with voters. Still, he closed the final full day of campaigning with a vulgar insult of Cruz.      The Texas senator brushed off Trump's comments, saying the reason the businessman engages in insults \\"is because he can't discuss the substance.\\"      As voters trickled in to polling stations early Tuesday, the results seemed far from decisive. Seventy-two-year-old Republican John Starer said he made up his mind about five minutes before he cast his ballot for Cruz. He said he was torn between Cruz and Trump but didn't think Trump could be elected.      \\"I think (Cruz is) about the only one who could possibly get elected as a Republican,\\" he said      The large Republican field was winnowed after Iowa, but there remains a crowded grouping of more traditional candidates, including Rubio and the governors.      Rubio appeared to be breaking away after a stronger-than-expected showing in Iowa, but he stumbled in Saturday's debate under intense pressure from Christie. The New Jersey governor has relentlessly cast the young senator as too inexperienced and too reliant on memorized talking points to become president.      Rubio played into Christie's hands by responding with the same well-rehearsed line each time he was challenged by the governor. Rival campaigns hope the moment was enough to give voters pause.      Megan Tolstenko, 33, an unaffiliated voter from Manchester, voted Tuesday for Christie, saying she thinks he would be best able to manage the country's defenses and the fight against the Islamic State group.      Kasich, who has prided himself on avoiding attacks on his rivals, said he hoped New Hampshire voters were \\"fed up with the negative.\\"      ___      Pace reported from Washington.

I tried hauling 2 bikes for a 3 hour trip and the rack would not stayed flat against my car; it kept tilting. I ended up pulling off and going into REI to buy a Yakima that is the same type of rack. The Yakima never budged for the remainder of the trip. The problem with the rack is that it does not have side stabilizers only top and bottom. I thought that all racks of this type had side, top and bottom stabilizers. It may be okay for one light weight bike. A:","output":"The given review is likely to significantly decrease the chances of you buying the product for several reasons. Firstly, the reviewer states that the product is \\"poorly designed\\" which suggests one or more design flaws that could impair usage and satisfaction. In this case, the bike rack's lack of side stabilizers is the obvious design flaw mentioned. This lack results in the rack not staying flat against the car and tilting. Additionally, the reviewer highlights the issue of the poorly designed bike rack through a real-life experience of trying to haul 2 bikes on a 3 hour trip. The review indicates the instability of the rack, given that it continued to tilt during the trip, eventually forcing the reviewer to stop their trip and buy an alternative product. The comparison with a different brand further accentuates the ineffectiveness of the product. The reviewer went into a store and decided to buy a Yakima rack of the same type, which did not budge for the remainder of the trip. The way the reviewer explicitly contrasts their experience with the Yakima rack suggests it is more reliable and efficient, serving its purpose without any issues. This could lead a potential buyer to look at the Yakima rack instead. Another important aspect is the limitation in terms of the load that the product can handle. The reviewer mentions that the rack might only be suitable for one lightweight bike. If a potential buyer is planning to transport multiple bikes or even a single heavy bike, this review would certainly decrease their likelihood of purchasing the product. Finally, reviews form a critical part of the decision-making process for consumers. They provide potential buyers with insight into the performance of the product based on the experiences of those who have already purchased and used it. In this case, the review is quite detailed and presents a negative image of the product, which will dissuade many potential buyers. In conclusion, after reading this review, the chances of purchasing this particular bike rack would decrease considerably due to its reported design flaw, poor performance in practice, unfavorable comparison with another brand, and limitations in its usage. Future buyers might be led to search for alternatives, particularly ones that can more securely transport more than one bike or heavier bikes."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past.  The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions.  In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

The glue was applied to the legs of the sofa but not the couch. That's because the  Choose your answer from: (I) sofa legs were broken.. (II) couch legs were broken..","output":"sofa legs were broken. As a result, the decision was made to focus on repairing the sofa before addressing any issues that may be present with the couch. The process of repairing the sofa legs began with a careful evaluation of the damage, which revealed that the legs had cracks and were not stable enough to support the weight of the sofa anymore. Thus, it was evident that the sofa legs required immediate reinforcement, and the best course of action was to use glue to hold them together for a strong bond. Before applying the glue, the surfaces of the sofa legs needed to be prepared. To ensure that the adhesive would create a durable bond, any dirt and debris were removed from the surfaces with a cloth, and they were then lightly sanded to create a textured area for the glue to adhere to. This step also allowed the removal of any weaker parts of the wood that could impede the bonding process of the glue. Once the surfaces were clean and properly prepared, a strong wood glue specifically designed for furniture repairs was chosen. This type of glue was selected due to its ability to create a bond that was not only long-lasting but also able to withstand the stress and weight that a sofa often encounters. It was crucial to adhere to the manufacturer's instructions in terms of application and drying time to ensure that the bond formed between the pieces was as strong as possible. The glue was carefully applied to the damaged areas of the sofa legs, along with adequate pressure to squeeze the pieces together. Doing so allowed any excess glue to seep out, helping to create a solid connection between the broken pieces. Clamps were used to hold the glued pieces together during the drying process, which typically lasts for around 24 hours. However, it's important to note that the clamps should not be overly tight, as this could potentially cause further damage to the cracked leg. While the couch was not in need of glue application at this point in time, it's crucial to monitor its condition and reassess whether any repairs are necessary in the future. The couch legs could potentially show signs of wear and tear, which would warrant similar attention and repair measures. Regular examination of furniture pieces prevents any underlying issues from getting worse and ultimately prolonging the lifespan of the furniture. In conclusion, the glue was applied to the legs of the sofa and not the couch due to the fact that the sofa legs were broken and required immediate repair. Through proper surface preparation, glue application, and adherence to the drying time, the sofa legs were successfully repaired and reinforced to continue supporting the weight of the sofa. The couch, on the other hand, did not display any signs of damage at this time, but it is essential to be vigilant in monitoring its condition in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: When does Mini's mother tell this story ? Mini's mother tells this story walking towards the railroad to receive Jack Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Tracks of Time\\" Act 1:  In the busy town of Kinsley, we are introduced to a humble and joyful little 8-year-old, Mini. Mini's mother, Grace, a strong, fierce yet gentle woman of strength and perseverance, often tells stories that depict her past life adventures. These are not ordinary fairy tales or bedtime stories; they are real, full of life, emotions, trials, and triumphs that Grace had endured.  One of these days, as they were walking towards the railroad to receive Jack, Grace's high school friend, Grace begins to share a story that feels different than the ones before. This time, the story appeared to have a part of Grace that was yet unexplored, the story of her youth and an unprofessed love. Act 2:  The story is set around Grace's youth, being a teenager and discovering the joys and harshness of life. Jack, Grace's best friend, was her greatest companion during her tough times. They both shared a deep bond of understanding and friendship, an undying relation that was deeply rooted in trust and affection. Grace describes her and Jack's mischievous activities, their shared laughter, and the comfort they found in each other's company. Yet, Grace never dared to express her growing love for Jack, fearing it might ruin their friendship. Jack, on the other hand, seemed oblivious and stayed absorbed in his world, focusing majorly on his dream to become a train driver. As their days of youth turned into memories, Jack left the town to chase his dreams, leaving Grace behind. Though hurt, Grace respected Jack's decisions, accepted his absence, and moved on with her life. During their walk to the railway, Mini finds herself entwined in her mother’s story. Grace's smile when uttering Jack's name, the subtle change in her tone, and even the sadness in her eyes provide Mini a hint of the unvoiced love story. Act 3:  As they reach the railway station, Grace concludes her story. She tells Mini how life moves on with or without the people we love, and that's what she did after Jack left. Time passed, and Grace got married, had Mini, but Jack's part in her life somehow remained vital. The day Jack contacted her announcing his return as a successful train driver, she knew she had to meet him.  Now Grace sees Jack, not that clueless teenager anymore but a grown man who achieved his dream. Their reunion is quite emotional yet memorable. Jack is introduced to Mini, who is now as excited as her mother to meet her new uncle.  As Jack, Grace, and Mini start spending time, Jack realises the feelings Grace had for him, which never faded even after so many years. A plot twist occurs when Jack confesses his love for Grace back in their youth days but never found the courage to express it.  Act 4:  The film ends in a bit of a bitter-sweet reality. Grace, now, has her family, a loving husband, and Mini, yet the story of her unspoken love becomes a memory that she shares with her daughter. The movie beautifully portrays that sometimes, love stories don’t have the typical happily-ever-after, yet they can teach someone as young as Mini about the essence of affection, friendship, sacrifice, and life. Grace's story of her silent love, cherished friendship, and unfulfilled dreams serves as an essential life lesson for Mini, who starts understanding the complexities of relationships and emotions at such a tender age. Mini's frequent walks toward the railroad become much more than just a meeting point but a path where ongoing stories of life are encountered, shaping her perception of the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: America is a mobile society.Friendships between Americans can be close and real, yet disappear soon if situations change.Neither side feels hurt by this.Both may exchange Christmas greetings for a year or two, perhaps a few letters for a while --then no more.If the same two people meet again by chance, even years later, they pick up the friendship.This can be quite difficult for us Chinese to understand, because friendships between us flower more slowly but then may become lifelong feelings, extending sometimes deeply into both families.          Americans are ready to receive us foreigners at their homes, share their holidays, and their home life.They will enjoy welcoming us and be pleased if we accept their hospitality  easily. Another difficult point for us Chinese to understand Americans is that although they include us warmly in their personal everyday lives, they don't show their politeness to us if it requires a great deal of time.This is usually the opposite of the practice in our country where we may be  _ .Sometimes, we, as hosts, will appear at airports even in the middle of the night to meet a friend.We may take days off to act as guides to our foreign friends.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.  - EMI Records was a British record label founded by the music company of the same name in 1972 as its flagship label, and launched in January 1973 as the successor to its Columbia and Parlophone record labels.

It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records.  - The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd.

The reason for this is that the term \\"derivative\\" generally implies a lack of originality or creativity, suggesting that the collection being referred to is unoriginal or copied from other sources. This is often viewed in a negative light, as people usually appreciate and value uniqueness and innovation. When referring to a collection, whether it be an artistic body of work, a group of ideas, or a set of products, using the word \\"derivative\\" does not evoke a sense of excitement or intrigue. Instead, it gives the impression that the collection is not innovative and may not be worth exploring further. While it is, of course, possible to interpret sentiments subjectively, and some people might not perceive the term \\"derivative\\" as strongly negative, the general consensus is that it has a negative connotation. In most contexts, people would prefer a collection to be described as original, creative, or unique, as these descriptors evoke a more positive sentiment and imply that the collection has something new and interesting to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? solid acting and","output":"a compelling storyline, but the editing and pacing could use some improvement Based on the given review, it can be inferred that the opinion towards the movie is a mixture of positive and negative sentiments. The positive aspects mentioned in the review are related to the acting and the storyline. The mention of \\"solid acting\\" indicates that the reviewer appreciates the performances of the actors involved. They may have found the portrayals of the characters convincing, engaging, and emotionally impactful. The remark about having a \\"compelling storyline\\" suggests that the plot of the movie is interesting, thought-provoking, and well-constructed. The reviewer likely found the narrative engaging and was able to maintain interest in the events and developments throughout the film. On the other hand, the negative aspects of the review pertain to the editing and pacing of the movie. The statement \\"the editing and pacing could use some improvement\\" denotes that the reviewer found certain aspects of the movie's technical execution to be subpar or problematic. The editing process involves selecting and arranging shots and sequences in a film to effectively convey the desired narrative and emotional impact. Thus, the reviewer may have encountered issues such as awkward transitions between scenes, excessive or insufficient coverage of particular moments, or other inconsistencies in maintaining a coherent visual flow. The pacing refers to the rhythm, tempo, and progression of events in the movie. The reviewer's comment implies that the film might have lagged or rushed in certain sections, or did not provide a smoothly progressing narrative. This could mean that the movie may have had scenes that felt too slow or dragged on unnecessarily, while others might have been too abrupt or not given enough time to develop. To conclude, the overall opinion towards the movie presented in the review seems to be mixed. The reviewer appreciated the performances of the actors and found the storyline engaging, which indicate positive opinions. However, they also felt that the editing and pacing of the film could be better, suggesting a negative sentiment in those areas. The review does not explicitly lean towards a predominantly positive or negative opinion, but rather highlights both positive and negative aspects of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo .

Choices: (a). no (b). yes","output":"GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GPS (Global Positioning System) are both global satellite-based navigation systems that provide accurate positioning and timing information to users by receiving signals transmitted from their respective satellite constellations. However, there are some key differences between the two systems that can affect the efficiency and accuracy of navigation applications. GLONASS is a Russian-operated satellite positioning system, whereas GPS is operated by the United States. The two systems use different frequencies and satellite constellations to provide positioning information. The GLONASS satellite constellation consists of 24 operational satellites (with a few spares), while the GPS system has a constellation of 31 operational satellites. The main differences between GLONASS and GPS are as follows: 1. Coverage: GPS provides global coverage, with better positioning accuracy in North America and Europe due to its satellite constellation design. GLONASS is optimized for the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Russia, and provides slightly better accuracy in those areas compared to GPS. However, both systems provide global coverage and can be used together to enhance accuracy and precision of navigation applications. 2. Frequency bands: GPS operates at L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.60 MHz) bands, while GLONASS operates at L1 (1602 MHz) and L2 (1246 MHz) bands. The slight differences in frequency bands can impact the performance of receivers. However, modern multi-constellation receivers can handle signals from both systems efficiently. 3. Signal structure and accuracy: GLONASS uses Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) signal structure, while GPS uses Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signal structure. The use of FDMA in GLONASS results in slightly lower positioning accuracy compared to GPS, but the difference is generally not significant in most applications. Comparing GLONASS and GPS, it is difficult to declare one system as definitively better than the other since both systems have their unique characteristics, strengths, and limitations. In general, GPS may provide slightly better accuracy and performance due to its larger satellite constellation and CDMA signal structure. However, combining signals from both GLONASS and GPS satellites can further improve positioning accuracy and reliability, particularly in urban environments or areas with challenging terrains where satellite visibility may be limited. Regarding the multi-choice problem, would you say that these questions are the same? (b). yes The two questions are essentially asking a comparison between GLONASS and GPS and seeking an opinion on which is better.

Who is less likely to experience internal organ failure?  Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time.  Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.  Hint: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure.

By default, your computer starts up by reading the operating system information from its built-in hard drive. You can change this by telling it to prioritize plugged-in USB items over the built-in hard drive.  The settings for your computers boot behavior are in a menu called the BIOS, which is a pre-startup menu you can access by pressing a key specific to your computer model as your computer turns on. In order to boot from a USB flash drive, the flash drive must be set up as a bootable item, and it must have a disk image (ISO) file with an operating system or similar service installed on it. The key that you press to access the BIOS varies depending on your computer manufacturer and model. You can look up your computer's BIOS key by typing your computer's manufacturer and model name, along with \\"bios key\\", into a search engine and reviewing the results, or you can consult your computer's manual if you still have it. Most computers use one of the function keys (e.g., F12) as the BIOS key, though some computers will use the Esc key or the Del key. The USB flash drive should plug into one of the rectangular USB ports on your computer's housing. On a laptop, the USB ports are typically on the sides of the housing, while desktop computers typically have the USB ports on the front or back of the tower. . If your flash drive isn't already bootable, use the Command Prompt or one of the Windows installation tools to make it so. Copy the ISO file you want to boot from by clicking it once and then pressing Ctrl+C, then open your flash drive and press Ctrl+V to paste in the file.  For example, if you're attempting to install or use Ubuntu Linux from the flash drive, you would paste the Ubuntu ISO file into the flash drive's window.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises when he retired in 2004?, using the article: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Possible answers: i. yes ii. it is not possible to tell iii. no","output":"iii. No. It does not logically follow that if \\"A man surfing a crashing wave,\\" then \\"The man is in a bathtub.\\" First, let's analyze the scenarios presented in the statements. In the first statement, \\"A man surfing a crashing wave,\\" we envision a man physically riding a surfboard on a large, powerful wave. Typically, this scenario takes place in a large body of water, such as the ocean. Surfing on crashing waves requires ample water, skill, and proper equipment, such as a surfboard. Moreover, the term \\"crashing wave\\" implies a forceful and dramatic event, which is usually associated with waves found in the ocean. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"The man is in a bathtub,\\" presents an entirely different scenario. Bathtubs are usually located in bathrooms and are relatively small in size when compared to bodies of water like oceans, which are required for surfing crashing waves. Bathtubs are designed for personal hygiene and relaxation purposes and do not provide the necessary conditions for surfing. The water in a bathtub is typically calm and does not generate powerful waves that would be suitable for surfing. Therefore, based on the information provided in the statements, \\"a man surfing a crashing wave\\" and \\"the man is in a bathtub\\" are two different scenarios that cannot logically be linked together. It does not make sense to conclude that a man surfing a crashing wave would be in a bathtub as bathtubs do not have the space or water conditions necessary for surfing. Thus, the most appropriate response is iii. No, it doesn't logically follow that if a man is surfing a crashing wave, then he is in a bathtub."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) works for Vito's Pizza, which has a strict 30-minutes-or-less delivery policy... which means either Nick makes it to the customer's door in half an hour or he has to pay for the pizza himself.

Write a summary based on this article: While scanning parenting blogs and sites yesterday, I came across an article on Huffington Post about a restaurant receipt with a note from a “single mom.” I was initially a little amused that this was making the rounds because it seems so silly. Who really cares if someone, single mom or not, left a tip? It’s rude in the extreme, but hardly worthy of public discussion. The more I thought about it, though, I realized it wasn’t funny at all.      The restaurant patron, who left no tip on a 138.55 bill, signing, “Single Mom, sorry,” may or may not have been a single mom. I think the diner was not really a single parent, or at least not one who couldn’t afford a tip, but rather someone trying to imply that some single moms feel like they are entitled to a pass because they are struggling financially. The note on the receipt (if it was indeed a joke), and the reaction it has drawn online, points to a larger issue. Increasingly, it seems, single moms are being used as the butt of jokes or, even worse, a scapegoat for societal ills.      What do you think? Is this receipt real? Is the incident indicative of a larger, mostly negative, attitude toward single mothers?      Related content:      Momspeak: Who speaks for the single parent?      Debate over AU professor should be about supporting working parents, not breast-feeding ||||| A photo of a receipt allegedly left by a single mother at a restaurant has gone viral after it was originally posted on Reddit. The bill shows a charge for a 138.35 meal with no additional tip. Instead, there's a note that reads \\"single mom sorry\\" -- implying that whoever signed the bill doesn't have enough money because it is expensive to raise kids alone.      Redditor PhoenixSongFawkes posted the photo and wrote, \\"I'm sure 140 could have gotten you and your kids a week worth of groceries, but instead you spend it one one meal?! For shame!\\"      (Story continues below photo.)      Commenters, including many single moms, were outraged. RedheadedBanshee wrote, \\"I'm a single Mom, and this is bullshit. What exactly are you teaching your kids? ... Dear Parents of all kinds - your kids are watching you and learning.\\" Dozens of commenters suggested that if a person -- single mom or not -- can't afford to leave a tip, that she shouldn't have gone out to eat at all and that whoever left this note is in the wrong.      Lindsay Cross, a blogger for Mommyish and former single mom, has another theory. Cross doesn't believe that the receipt is legitimate. \\"It’s completely possible that someone wanted to be an asshole and blame it on single moms. Honestly, the more I think about how anyone would do this to a waitress, the more I think it’s likely that this was just a very awful prank to make single moms look bad,\\" she wrote.      Though Cross makes it apparent that she isn't trying to stereotype single moms, she notes that moms who raise kids on their own are generally sympathetic to those in service positions and mostly try to help those who are working hard. But on the other hand, as Cross and many commenters argued, \\"jerks\\" come in all shapes and sizes.

This article: In 1988, when Katrina \\"Kat\\" Connors was 17, her beautiful but mercurial mother, Eve, disappeared without a trace. The story weaves back-and-forth with flashbacks of Eve's past life and the present day. In the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock, an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil, Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective investigating her mother's disappearance. The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991. On a break from college, Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co-worker.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that recorded with the Hawks?, using the article: After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\". These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\\"This Wheel's on Fire\\"), The Byrds (\\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\"), and Manfred Mann (\\"Mighty Quinn\\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. Over the years, more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on bootleg recordings, culminating in a five-CD set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes, containing 107 songs and alternative takes.

Whether or not this would make coal more expensive depends on various economic factors including supply and demand, cost of extraction, and market competition which are not directly part of the process described here. But if we solely talk about the process mentioned, digging up more coal would just increase the quantity of coal available for burning."},{"instruction":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Titanic Movie plot: At the last minute, a wealthy American expatriate in Europe, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), buys a steerage-class ticket for the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic from a Basque immigrant. Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \\"Giff\\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns her mother's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with her father on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play contract bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds Richard about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, Richard coldly brushes him off. Meanwhile Giff falls for Annette at first glance. At first she repulses his brash attempts to become better acquainted, but eventually she warms to him. That night, Giff, Annette and a group of young people sing and play the piano in the dining...
