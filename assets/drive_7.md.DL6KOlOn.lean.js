What did John pull open?  Choices:  - closet - chest - drawer - dresser - suitcase  The rationale to choose \\"drawer\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"A: The rationale to choose \\"drawer\\" as the answer is that: 1. Establish context: The question mentions that John was looking for a shirt, indicating that he is searching for a piece of clothing. 2. Evaluate choices:    a. Closet: A closet could be a potential answer as it is commonly used for storing clothes, including shirts. However, the question mentions that John \\"pulled open\\" something, which is typically not a phrase used to describe opening a closet, so this option is less likely.    b. Chest: A chest is typically not the primary storage for clothing items, especially shirts. Additionally, chests are typically not \\"pulled open\\" but rather \\"lifted open.\\"    c. Drawer: Drawers are commonly found in dressers and storage spaces designed for clothes, and they are indeed \\"pulled open.\\" This matches the phrasing and context of the question.    d. Dresser: While a dresser is a piece of furniture used for storing clothes, the question implies that John pulled open a specific part of a storage unit, not the entire unit itself. Therefore, \\"dresser\\" is not the best answer.    e. Suitcase: Although people may store clothes in a suitcase when traveling, it is not a typical storage option for everyday use at home. Furthermore, suitcases are usually zipped or closed with clasps, not \\"pulled open.\\" 3. Choose the best answer: Based on the evaluation of the choices, \\"drawer\\" is the most appropriate answer, as it matches both the context and phrasing of the question.

Information:  - Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels. Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.30.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.38.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop...  - Newborn screening is a public health program of screening in infants shortly after birth for a list of conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period. Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician.  - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life.  - Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 23% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic cases account for 3050% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013.  - Jean H. Dussault , ( 1941 -- March 23 , 2003 ) was a Canadian endocrinologist .

His wife had told him that he should remarry after her death, so he pursues some local spinsters who were at his daughter's wedding after he and his housekeeper Minta (Lillian Hall-Davis) make out a list of possibilities. First is Widow Louisa Windeatt, but Sweetland is shocked and mad when she rejects his advances and says she is too independent for him. Next, he attempts to court Thirza Tapper, a nervous wreck who almost collapses when Sweetland proposes to her. She, too, rejects him because she says she has no need for a man, and he is furious yet again. He wanders outside as other guests arrive for her party. His bolshie servant Ash is helping at the party, wearing an ill-fitting coat and trying to keep his trousers up while doing his work at the party.

Dans les situations avec un paramètre a vrai de Ricker variant dans le temps, l'estimation avec le filtre de Kalman a donné des captures cumulatives moyennes supérieures à celles données par la régression linéaire ordinaire, la méthode avec correction de biais de Walter, ou une politique imposant un taux fixe de capture. Translate to English","output":"In situations with a time-varying true Ricker parameter, estimation using the Kalman filter provided higher mean cumulative catches than those provided by ordinary linear regression, the bias-corrected Walter method, or a policy imposing a fixed capture rate. In time-varying situations, the Kalman filter, which is a powerful estimation tool for linear dynamic systems, proves to be more effective than traditional estimation methods, such as ordinary linear regression or other bias-corrected techniques like the Walter method. This is due to the dynamic nature of the Kalman filter, which continuously updates its estimates based on available data and its internal model, making it better suited for handling changing parameters. The comparison of the Kalman filter with these other methods demonstrates that it can potentially lead to better estimates and, in the context of this specific problem, higher mean cumulative catches. The adaptive nature of the Kalman filter allows it to track the time-varying Ricker parameter more accurately than ordinary linear regression, which assumes a static relationship between the variables; or the Walter method, which tries to correct for biases but still relies on similar assumptions. Moreover, the Kalman filter outperforms a policy imposing a fixed capture rate, highlighting the importance of adapting to changing environmental conditions and parameter values in order to optimize resource utilization. The fixed capture rate policy may result in either over- or under-harvesting of resources due to its inability to adapt to the changing circumstances. Overall, the superiority of the Kalman filter in estimating the time-varying Ricker parameter can be attributed to its adaptability and ability to process dynamic information, leading to better predictions and, consequently, more effective resource management. The use of the Kalman filter can therefore be beneficial in many applications, including those involving dynamic systems and fluctuating parameters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: The story of a drifter, his sheep ranch boss, and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but it's still very intriguing.

With Cold War tensions cooling down, Leiter has transferred to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and he's spent the last several months attempting to capture elusive drug kingpin Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi). He is considered one of the most ruthless drug lords around, operating an invisible drug empire that stretches all the way from Alaska to Chile, and he's proven impossible to catch, having managed to kill, intimidate or bribe every major politician in the Western Hemisphere who could give him up.As Bond, Leiter, and Leiter's fishing buddy Sharkey (Frank McRae) drive to the wedding, Leiter's boss, Hawkins (Grand L.

The timetable to capture him before he can flee to non-extradition territory is tight, so Leiter decides to take it. Bond accompanies him aboard a Coast Guard helicopter, \\"strictly as an observer,\\" to ensure that he will be back on time, and alive, for the wedding, leaving Sharkey to stall the proceedings until they get back.The reason Sanchez is venturing this far north today is because he's found out that his mistress Lupe Lamora (Talisa Soto) is having an affair with another man.

However, the federal government is now asking Quebec to step aside and implement the federal policy, implying that the federal policy is more stringent and punitive than Quebec's. The presence of a coalition in Quebec regarding this issue also supports the idea that their approach likely differs from the federal policy. That being said, it is essential to carefully analyze and compare both the federal and Quebec policies to get a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the differences and nuances between the two. While the conclusion drawn suggests that the federal policy is more punitive, it may be necessary to consider additional factors such as crime rates, rehabilitation programs, and available resources in both jurisdictions to determine whether one policy is indeed more punitive than the other or if there are alternative approaches that may work in tandem to achieve the desired outcomes in the area of youth justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What term describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid?   A: Choices: [-] mix; [-] suspension; [-] compound; [-] emulsion; Answer:","output":"A: The term that describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid is an emulsion. Emulsions are a type of mixture where two immiscible substances (substances that do not mix easily) are combined and stabilized through the presence of an emulsifying agent. The four choices provided were mix, suspension, compound, and emulsion, and based on the given paragraph, the answer is emulsion. A mix may refer to any combination of substances, but it does not specifically imply the presence of a colloidal dispersion or stabilization. Meanwhile, a suspension is a type of heterogeneous mixture in which solid particles are dispersed in a liquid, with particles being larger than those found in emulsions. Suspensions are usually prone to separating over time and do not remain stable unlike emulsions. A compound, on the other hand, represents a completely different type of relationship between elements. It is a substance formed from two or more elements chemically bonded together in a fixed proportion. Compounds have unique properties that are distinct from the properties of their constituent elements, and their composition cannot be altered by physical means. In contrast, emulsions are mixtures without fixed proportions and can be separated by physical means, such as centrifugation or filtration. In conclusion, based on the given paragraph and the four choices provided, the term that describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid is an emulsion. Emulsions have unique properties, such as stability due to the presence of an emulsifying agent, and are distinct from the other choices presented: mix, suspension, and compound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less batter on the griddle happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves \\"less batter on the griddle.\\" This phrase seems to be unrelated to the process of recycling aluminum cans. There is no clear connection between the amount of batter on a griddle and the recycling of aluminum cans. Therefore, it is not expected that this particular perturbation would have a direct or indirect effect on the process of recycling aluminum cans. However, if we were to consider a situation where the phrase \\"less batter on the griddle\\" were metaphorically referring to reduced availability of aluminum in general or a decrease in aluminum production, then we could explore the potential effects on the recycling process. In such a case, the perturbation could potentially lead to: 1. Increased efforts to recycle aluminum: If aluminum becomes scarcer, there may be increased incentives to recycle existing aluminum products. This could lead to more recycling programs and better recycling facility efficiency, indirectly resulting in more aluminum cans being recycled. 2. A shift in consumer behavior: Scarcity of aluminum might lead to changes in consumer preferences and behavior. Consumers might be more aware of the need to recycle and choose products made from recycled aluminum or other sustainable materials, further increasing the recycling rate of aluminum cans. 3. Greater emphasis on recycling technology innovation: As aluminum becomes scarce, there may be a need to improve the efficiency of the recycling process itself, leading to innovations and advancements in recycling technology. This could directly improve aluminum recycling efficiency and indirectly result in more aluminum cans being recycled. In summary, the supposed perturbation (less batter on the griddle) appears to be unrelated to the recycling process of aluminum cans. However, if we interpret this phrase as a metaphor for reduced aluminum availability, it could have some indirect effects on the recycling process, potentially leading to more aluminum cans being recycled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Jason and the Argonauts Context: Pelias (Douglas Wilmer), misinterpreting the prophecy given to him by the god Zeus (Niall MacGinnis), usurps the throne of Thessaly, killing King Aristo and most of his family. The infant Jason is spirited away by one of Aristo's soldiers. Pelias slays one of the king's daughters, Briseis (Davina Taylor), as she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess Hera (Honor Blackman). Because the murder has profaned her temple, the angry Hera becomes Jason's protector. She warns Pelias to beware \\"of a man wearing one sandal\\". Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong) saves Pelias from drowning (orchestrated by Hera), but loses his sandal in the river; Pelias recognizes him from the prophecy. Learning that Jason intends to find the legendary Golden Fleece, he encourages him, hoping Jason will be killed in the attempt. Jason is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. Hera tells him Zeus has decreed he can only call upon her for aid five times. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis. Zeus offers his direct aid, but Jason declares he can organize the voyage, build a ship, and collect a crew of the bravest men in all Greece. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor. Because their ship is named the Argo after her builder, Argus (Laurence Naismith), the crew are dubbed the Argonauts. Among them are Hercules (Nigel Green), Hylas (John Cairney), and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, sent by his father to sabotage the voyage. Hera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a treasure building, surmounted by a gigantic statue of Talos, which comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos' heel, to release the giant's ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas, hiding his body.

(2007) have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups, it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster. They found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used in order for the answer to the question \\"How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?\\" to be \\"never\\". This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian). The entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of markers for the same answer. The authors conclude that \\"caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.\\" Witherspoon, et al. concluded that, \\"The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them.

This means that there isn't a straightforward answer to which populations individuals are more frequently similar to, as genetic similarity can vary significantly, even within a single population. Furthermore, their findings highlight that most human genetic variation is found within populations rather than between them, suggesting that it is not accurate to assume that individuals will always be more closely related to members of their own population group.

What evidence supports this claim?","output":"The claim that there is a moral obligation to protect fellow human beings is a concept that can be traced back through millennia of philosophical, religious, and cultural teachings. The evidence supporting this claim comes from various sources such as ethics theories, religious doctrines, human rights, empathy, social contract theories, and cultural norms. 1. Ethics theories: Several moral frameworks and philosophical theories emphasize the responsibility humans have towards one another. Some prominent examples include:    a. Virtue Ethics: This ethical concept, rooted in the works of Aristotle and other ancient Greek philosophers, highlights the importance of developing good character traits like compassion and empathy, which prompt individuals to look out for the well-being of others.    b. Deontological Ethics: Proposed by Immanuel Kant, this theory posits that certain moral duties should be followed regardless of the consequences. Kant's \\"categorical imperative\\" suggests that we must treat others as ends in themselves, not merely as means to an end – which includes nurturing and protecting them.    c. Utilitarianism: Based on the idea that we should maximize the overall well-being and minimize harm, utilitarians argue for the moral obligation to protect and promote the welfare of all human beings. 2. Religious doctrines: Many world religions teach their followers to care for others and protect them, providing moral guidance on this matter.    a. Christianity: The teachings of Jesus Christ spotlight the obligation to love thy neighbor and care for the least among us. This can be interpreted as an ethical responsibility to protect fellow human beings.    b. Islam: The principle of compassion and the responsibility to protect life and alleviate suffering are central to Islamic teachings. The concept of zakat (almsgiving) underscores the duty Muslims have in helping others.    c. Buddhism: The Buddhist teachings highlight the importance of compassion and kindness towards all living beings, including humans, advocating for the protection of life and reduction of suffering.    d. Judaism: The Jewish concept of \\"Tikkun Olam,\\" which means \\"repairing the world,\\" encourages believers to take action to protect and enhance the lives of others. 3. Human rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations in 1948, enumerates numerous rights - such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person - that implicitly call for the moral obligation to protect one another. 4. Empathy: As social creatures, human beings have evolved to feel empathy, allowing us to respond emotionally to the experiences of others. This natural capacity for compassion persuades us to protect and safeguard those around us, reinforcing the moral obligation to do so. 5. Social contract theories: Philosophers like John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argue that humans living in society have mutually agreed upon certain rules to ensure collective protection and well-being. By participating in and benefiting from this social contract, individuals inherently uphold a moral obligation to protect fellow human beings. 6. Cultural norms: Beyond philosophical theories and religious teachings, many cultures have inherent values and norms centered on supporting and protecting others within their community. These values can be passed down through generations via customs and practices that foster a sense of moral obligation. In conclusion, the moral obligation to protect fellow human beings finds substantial support in the realms of ethical theories, religious doctrines, human rights, empathy, social contract theories, and cultural norms. Each of these sources emphasizes the inherent responsibility humans have to care for one another, creating a compelling case for the existence of such a moral obligation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's.

They said about 1,700 illegal migrants had arrived during the past two weeks. Acre, in the Amazon region, has asked for additional funding from the federal government to cope with the influx. More than 5,000 Haitians have arrived in Acre since 2010, but in recent months there has been an increase in immigration from Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh. Officials say the routes through Peru and Bolivia have become popular with people smugglers because dense vegetation makes it difficult for border police to patrol them. Dangerous odyssey Most of those who get caught are housed in a temporary shelter in the town of Brasileia, 280km (173 miles) south-west of the state capital Rio Branco. By Fabio PontesBBC Brasil The immigrants are housed in the former headquarters of a football club - it is a big warehouse-style building, where temperatures get extremely high. The average temperature during this season in Acre is around 35 degrees. Inside, it rises to more than 40 degrees. It can shelter up to 200 people but there are now more than 1,000; some have been relocated to tents outside. Others are sleeping rough in public spaces using their suitcases as beds and pillows. Because there are not enough public toilets, some of them are having to relieve themselves in the woods. The situation is truly chaotic. It is estimated that 10% of Brasileia's 20,000-strong population are immigrants who arrived within the last two years. Many of them are Haitians who fled their country after the 2010 earthquake, which left much of Haiti devastated. Resident Eli Lima de Freita told BBC Brasil that the town was in a state of \\"absolute chaos'' as the authorities struggle to house and feed the immigrants. State authorities say dealing with the unexpected wave of illegal immigration has cost them about 1.5m (Â£1m) over the past two years. Haitian immigrants described flying from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, to Panama, then to Ecuador, from where they journeyed on by land to either Peru or Bolivia. From there they crossed into Acre, often paying \\"coyotes\\" or people smugglers to get them across the border. The Senegalese said they had travelled north from Senegal to Morocco, crossing over to Spain, from where they flew to Ecuador. From there, they continued along the same route taken by the Haitians. For many, Acre is not the final destination. They said they were trying to reach big urban centres in Brazil, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but would stay wherever they could make a living. Brazilian police last year raided a number of sweatshops in the capital, Brasilia, and in Sao Paulo, where undocumented immigrants from Bolivia and Pakistan were found working in unsafe conditions for very little or no pay.

The number of immigrants has increased so much that the town is becoming very crowded and chaotic, and it is causing problems, like not having enough toilets or places to sleep. The immigrants come from far away and use different paths, often with the help of people who sneak them across borders.

His family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there. His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century. Hillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf. They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959-1975). In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off. In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979.  His son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990.

George Osborne today announced that he would put £340million towards fixing Britain's battered infrastructure by repairing potholes and building new flood defences. Following the winter storms which left areas of the country underwater, the Chancellor announced that he would be making an extra £140million available for repairs to flood defences and providing £200million for local authorities to repair potholes. The winter storms flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people and caused untold devastation, with Somerset among the worst-hit areas after the wettest winter since records began. Announcement: A £340million fund for flood defences and repairing potholes has been promised after record storms left swathes of the country, including on the Somerset Levels (pictured) underwater. Soaked: A woman pushes her dog in a wheelbarrow through flooded Staines-upon-Thames last month. Hurricane-force winds and flooding led to felled power lines and blackouts for more than 100,000 families, while it has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £830million. Much of the country’s transport network was plunged into chaos, with roads and railways wrecked, and countless buildings damaged. The Government was also forced to call in troops to help rescue stranded victims. Today's announcement follows David Cameron’s promise during last month’s crisis that ‘money is no object’ in clearing up the damage and preventing a repeat. However, the extra money promised today by Mr Osborne has been criticised for not going far enough in solving either issue, with the flood defence fund described as a merely a 'sticking plaster' by Dr Colin Brown, Director of Engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. 'The £140 million announced in today’s. Budget for repairs to UK flood defences is a \\"sticking plaster\\" approach and simply does not go far enough,' he said. 'The. Government needs to be investing in new flood defences and ongoing. maintenance projects to ensure long-term UK resilience, neither of which. was mentioned by the Chancellor. Equally, there was no mention of. resilience plans for other extreme weather conditions which the UK will. be increasingly susceptible to in future years. 'Every. £1 spent in resilience saves £4 in future relief and rebuilding costs,. which is why we need to be taking a much longer-term view of UK. infrastructure. 'Elsewhere,. the Institution welcomes the Chancellor’s proposals to provide £7. billion to cut energy bills for manufacturers in energy-intensive. industries. Ongoing: Flood water remained in fields surrounding the village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels last weekend. After the rain: It has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £830million. 'These. initiatives will help UK firms become more competitive in the global. market by reducing costs and encouraging them stay in the UK. 'The. Institution also welcomes the continuing support for graphene, a truly. British invention with a multitude of future possibilities.  The. creation of a new centre of excellence will advance the already. committed £111m to graphene research and exploitation, and will help the. UK reap the commercial benefits this miracle material. 'Additionally,. while we welcome the support for HS2 and regional airports and the. Chancellor’s vision of seeing this beyond the current plans, we need to. see more details and the Government needs to show more commitment to. creating an integrated UK transport system.' Liz Peace, Chief Executive of the British Property Federation said that the flood defence money was welcome, but raised concerns over flood insurance police. 'We are pleased to see that the. Government is committed to spending on flood defences and helping those. that have been hardest hit by the recent storms, but today's. announcement of £140m funding to repair flood defences do not assuage. our fears about the government's new flood insurance scheme, Flood Re,. which currently stands to expose thousands of homeowners to rocketing. insurance premiums,' she said. Friends of the Earth economics campaigner, David Powell said also criticised the Government's pledge, and said that Mr Osborne had not done enough to address climate change. Budget: George Osborne with the traditional red dispatch box as he departs to deliver his annual budget speech. Funds: Mr Osborne told the House of Commons that money would be available for repairs after the winter floods. He said: 'Merely weeks after promising action on flooding and global warming, the best the Chancellor can manage is a U-turn on his own reckless flood defence cuts, and caving in to big business lobbying on pollution tax. 'Mr Osborne says he wants to make our economy \\"resilient\\", but Britons face paying a hefty price for his failure to confront the reality of climate change.' He added: 'George Osborne’s self-congratulation on flood spending is ill-founded. 'The \\"extra\\" £140m only cancels out previous cuts, while households in storm-battered Britain are picking up the bill for the Government’s negligence. 'And if we want to keep pace with the impacts of climate change, far more must be spent on flood defences.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, welcomed the £200million put aside to repair potholes, but said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog. ‘A succession of bad weather, including the recent floods, has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome,' he said. 'But the drip, drip of funding does not address the £10 billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified. It is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for. This creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits.’ Bump in the road: Local authorities will be provided with an extra £200million for local authorities to repair potholes. Backlog: Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog. Tony Ball, vice chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, welcomed the extra funding, but said the country was facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040, and the situation on the roads was getting worse. 'This announcement does not go anywhere near far enough. We urge the Government to provide a full and comprehensive package, including the resurfacing of roads, rather than funding in dribs and drabs.' Mr Osborne also announced a number of other transport measures. There will be a guarantee of up to £270million to support the raising of debt finance for the Mersey Gateway Bridge - a project that will see a road bridge over the River Mersey in north west England. Also, the Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne further north into Scotland, if the Scottish Government will match fund the costs of the study. Mr Osborne said that the Government had agreed that the Welsh Government can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the M4. The UK Government is also financially supporting the Greater Cambridge enterprise partnership's transport and infrastructure plans in a deal that could be worth up to £500 million over 15 to 20 years. Investigation: The Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne further north into Scotland. Mr Osborne said the vehicle excise duty (VED) car tax would increase by the RPI rate of inflation from April 1 2014 but, as announced earlier, VED rates for lorries will be reduced and restructured from April 1. Campaign for Better Transport chief executive Stephen Joseph said: 'The Chancellor has done little to reduce the everyday cost of transport which remains one of the biggest costs faced by households. 'The £20 million tax break the Chancellor is giving to bingo halls would be better spent reversing the planned cuts to bus services this year. Extra money to tackle potholes is welcome, but this is a drop in the ocean against the £10bn backlog to local road repairs. These are the issues that matter to people rather than big road building.' Sustainable transport group Sustrans said: 'Any money to repair this winter's damage to our roads is welcome but, considering the £10 billion road maintenance backlog, £200 million is nowhere near enough. 'Potholes are dangerous for all road users. Resolving this crisis will save lives.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Chancellor George Osborne announced a £340 million fund to repair the UK's infrastructure, specifically addressing flood defenses and pothole repairs after winter storms caused severe damage. The storms flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people, and caused havoc on roads, railways, and damaged buildings.

You wear lighter clothes during the summer, like shorts and t-shirts, and heavier clothes like sweaters during winter, right? So, you can arrange your clothes based on these seasons. In this game of organising, you put the clothes or items that you don't use much behind the ones that you use frequently. Imagine, you don't want to wear your winter clothes in the summer, right? So, you put them right at the back of your closet. That way your summer clothes, your favorite shorts and t-shirts, are right in the front. Oh! And you know what else can go inside your castle, I mean your closet? Your treasure boxes full of memories! Yes, you can store your boxes full of photographs on their own special shelf in your closet. It's like a secret chamber inside your castle where you store all your precious moments. Isn't that exciting? Now, not only is your closet nice and neat, but it's also easier for you to find your favorite items. And every time you open your closet, you'll feel good because it's so well organized. Just like your very own castle.

The premise says that the material needs to be (2) noncorrosive and (3) easily cleaned. Fiberglass containers are just an example of something that fits those requirements. Now, we want to know if the material can be a steel alloy from Denver. Steel alloys can rust, which means they can corrode. So they don't fit the noncorrosive requirement (2).

Horslips are an Irish Celtic rock band that compose, arrange and perform songs frequently inspired by traditional Irish airs, jigs and reels. The group are regarded as 'founding fathers of Celtic rock' for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music and went on to inspire many local and international acts. They formed in 1970 and 'retired' in 1980 for an extended period. The name originated from a spoonerism on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which became \\"The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse\\". Johnny Fean continued to play live music with Stephen Travers, formerly of The Miami Showband.  After his retirement, Eamon Carr went on to become a producer of young rock talent in the mid-1980s, and also forming his own record label called Hotwire (which sponsored noted acts such as the punk rock group The Golden Horde).

It falls somewhere between a light drama and a comedy, but the seasoned professional acting (particularly lead James Garner) and experienced direction is far above usual TV standards. There is a pretty good story about excess and the battle for big bucks.James Garner is F. Ross Johnson, who has gone from being a hardworking paperboy in Winnipeg, Canada to a jet setting, big spending CEO in NYC. When Johnson is faced with an expensive project that seems headed for failure, he chooses to deflect shareholder backlash by trying to raise the money to buy the company himself. It might have worked, but when a couple other green sharks get the whiff of possible profit, the bidding war is on. What follows is corporate juggling, scrambling, and general skulduggery in a world where all the numbers have nine zeroes.Imagine a Wall Street where Gordon Gekko is a charming, nice guy (but greed is still good) and with a comedy slant, and you will have some idea of what to expect here.

Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani brought. the luxurious two-story apartment spread over 10,923 square feet in the. One57 building back in May. Furthermore, the billionaire sheikh, who has two wives and 15 children, is reportedly also in discussions about buying four separate, full-floor condos in the exclusive Midtown building, which would bring the total cost to an incredible 250 million. Revealed: The prime minister of Qatar has been revealed as the mystery buyer who spent almost 100 million to purchase New York City's most expensive penthouse back in May. Loss: The sheik called off a deal to purchase a 100million penthouse in the not-yet-completed One57 building, complete with 10,923 square feet and breathtaking views of the city skyline. The One57 building’s developer, Extell’s. Gary Barnett, confirmed on May 18 that the apartment had been brought but would. only say that a ‘very nice family’ had snapped it up. Mr Barnett said previously that the. buyer, now known to be Al-Thani, was also looking at buying the Winter Garden unit - a duplex featuring a. solarium totaling 13,500ft and another floor to create a 20,000 square. feet space. If he does make these further purchases that will likely more than double his spending - bringing it up to a staggering 250 million. Al-Thani laid down between 90million and 100million for the penthouse after his 31.5 million bid for a couple of Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the late copper heiress Huguette Clark, was rejected. And he brought the One57 penthouse before he could even see it completed, as the building is currently in development and only due to be finished next year. The astronomical fee of the penthouse apartment eclipses the. 88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a. penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West. The view: When completed, the towering One57 building will provide unparalleled views of Central Park. No doubt the owners will be able to afford good window treatments if they want to block out the incredible lights visible from the master bedroom in order to sleep. The One57 building is across the street from Carnegie Hall and a stone’s throw from Central Park. The penthouse, on the 89th and 90th. floors, boasts a ‘grand salon’, at least five bedrooms, four fireplaces,. floor-to-ceiling windows and a large mezzanine, the New York Post. reported. As well as staggering views over the Manhattan skyline and beyond, the property also features impressive 23-foot ceilings. Al-Thani shelled out on the Midtown penthouse after his bid for two Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the famously reclusive Huguette Clark, was refused. 'He decided to buy the One57 penthouse after the Huguette Clark rejection,' a source told the New York Post. Despite offering 500,000 over the asking price, the powerful PM’s bid. was refused with the building’s co-op board even refusing the. sheikh an interview. Rejected: Al-Thani initially hoped to buy a couple of Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the late copper heiress Huguette Clark, for 31.5 million but his bid was rejected by the co-op board. It is thought the board stonewalled his offer after it was revealed he planned to knock the two eight floor apartments into one. It was also reported that al-Thani's huge family –. and the entourage of staff who travel with them – also caused concerns. for the co-op board. Other reasons cited for the rejection. were concerns about where his money was coming from and the fact that. the Sheikh is a foreign head of state with diplomatic immunity. Situated on 157 West 57th street One57 will become the tallest residential building in the city when it. is finished next year.

Please briefly summarize this news article: WalMart's Mexican Bribery Scandal Will Sink It Like an Iceberg Sank the Titanic Unlike previous Titanic films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome. (Photo credit: Wikipedia) WalMart’s been accused of bribing officials in Mexico to grow its business. But by and large, few in America seem to care. The stock fell only modestly from its highs of last week, and today the stock recovered from the drop off to the lows of February. But WalMart is going to fail. WalMart is trying to defend and extend a horribly outdated industrial strategy. WalMart succeeded by changing retail Sam Walton opened his original five and dime stores in the rural countryside, and competed just like small retailers had done for decades. But quickly he recognized that industrialization offered the opportunity to shift the retail market. By applying industrial concepts like scale, automation and volume buying he could do for retailing what Ford and GM had done for auto manufacturing. And his strategy, designed for an industrial marketplace, worked extremely well. Like it or not, WalMart outperformed retailers still trying to compete like they had in the 1800s, and WalMart was spectacularly successful. But today, the world has shifted again. Only WalMart is putting all its resources into defending and extending its industrial era strategy, rather than modifying to compete in the information age. Because its strategy doesn’t work, the company keeps wandering into spectacular failures, and horrible leadership scandals. All of these incidents show a leadership team that is so entrenched in history it will do anything – anything – to keep from evolving forward. And that history paved a pathway where it was only a very small step to paying bribes in order to open more stores in Mexico. Such bribes could easily be seen as just “doing what it takes” to keep defending the existing business model, extending it into new markets, even though it is at the end of its money-making life. It came to light that after paying the bribes WalMart’s leadership team did about everything it could to cover them up. Including spending millions on lobbying efforts to hopefully change the laws before anyone was caught, and possibly prosecuted. The goal was to keep the stores open, and open more. If that meant a little bribing went on, then it was best to not let people know. And instead of saying what WalMart did was wrong, change the rules so it doesn’t look like it was wrong. WalMart is in a performance whirlpool, and has no functioning strategic compass At WalMart right and wrong are no longer based on societal norms, they are based on whether or not it lets WalMart defend its existing business by doing more of what it wants to do. WalMart’s industrial strategy is similar to the Titanic strategy. Build a boat so big it can’t sink. And if any retailer could be that big, then WalMart was it. But these scandals keep showing us that the water is increasingly full of icebergs. Each scandal points out that WalMart’s strategy is harder to navigate, and is running into big problems. Even though the damage isn’t visible to most of us, it is clear to WalMart executives that doing more of the same is leading to less good results. WalMart is taking on water, and it has no solution. To prop up results executives keep doing things that are less and less ethical – sometimes even illegal – and providing guidance down through all levels of management and employment to do the same.","output":"Walmart has been accused of bribing officials in Mexico to expand its business. Despite the scandal, the company's stock has not suffered significantly. However, the article argues that Walmart is bound to fail as it continues to rely on an outdated industrial strategy, instead of embracing the information age. Walmart's leadership has been entrenched in the past, leading to failures and scandals. The company's focus on defending and extending its existing business model becomes increasingly unethical and sometimes illegal, making it unsustainable in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I can use this background: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.  Now, I have a new situation: A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo.  Answer this question please: Which markalong was produced asexually? A:","output":"Markalong A was produced asexually, as it has only one parent.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

A coalition of international organizations launched a public pressure campaign to prevent any minerals development in the region, led largely by Greenpeace International, which established its own scientific station—World Park Base—in the Ross Sea region and conducted annual expeditions to document environmental effects of humans on Antarctica. In 1988, the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources (CRAMRA) was adopted. The following year, however, Australia and France announced that they would not ratify the convention, rendering it dead for all intents and purposes.

Oz show info is \\"safe and educational for our viewers,\\" Oz spokesman says.","output":"Title: \\"Dr. Oz Faces Lawsuit for Heated Rice Footsie Recommendation: A Warning for Diabetics with Neuropathy\\" Introduction: Dr. Oz, a popular television personality and health guru, is facing a lawsuit after a recommendation he made on his show reportedly led to severe third-degree burns on a viewer's feet. The incident emphasizes the importance of exercising caution and understanding individual health conditions before trying out new home remedies. Step 1: Discuss the \\"Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie\\" incident. In the incident, Dr. Oz had recommended the \\"Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie\\" as a simple and accessible home remedy for warming up cold feet. However, Frank Dietl, a viewer who followed the advice, experienced devastating consequences as a result of not being warned about the potential risks for someone with neuropathy. The lawsuit contends that Oz should have provided clear warnings to viewers with medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the remedy. Step 2: Explain neuropathy and its relationship to diabetes. Neuropathy is a medical condition that affects the nervous system, leading to a decrease in sensitivity and increased pain in various parts of the body. For diabetics, neuropathy often occurs in the lower extremities, such as the feet. Reduced sensitivity means that individuals with neuropathy may not feel pain, heat, or cold as intensely as others, which can lead to unnoticed injuries and, in severe cases, even amputation. Step 3: Highlight the importance of personalized health recommendations. As the lawsuit highlights, it is crucial for television personalities, medical professionals, and experts alike to give personalized and targeted health advice that takes into consideration individual health conditions, such as neuropathy. While Dr. Oz's foot-warming remedy may be safe for many people, it proved to be a serious hazard for someone like Frank Dietl, who had reduced sensitivity in his feet due to his diabetes. Step 4: Include a response from Dr. Oz's representatives. In response to the lawsuit, a spokesman for Dr. Oz stated that the information provided on the show is intended to be \\"safe and educational for our viewers.\\" However, this statement emphasizes the importance of carefully considering individual health conditions and limitations before attempting any home remedy or treatment. Conclusion: The \\"Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie\\" lawsuit serves as a cautionary tale not only for Dr. Oz but for all health and wellness advocates. It is essential for health professionals, television personalities, and anyone sharing health advice to take the time to understand individual health conditions and the potential risks associated with specific treatments and recommendations.

She is also the author of the new book “Lead Positive: What Highly Effective Leaders See, Say & Do.” Cramer spoke with Tom Fox, a guest writer for On Leadership and vice president for leadership and innovation at the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. Fox also heads up their Center for Government Leadership. Q. What do you consider to be the top skills that create long-term success as a leader in government? A. I think optimism and confidence are two assets that really help a leader go the distance. I also believe the ability to empathize and inspire are key. Lastly, when looking at a leader in a time of crisis, it is important for employees to see a high degree of resilience. This is proof that a leader can be proactive after a big setback. Q. What's the concept of “lead positive”? A. In the book, we’ve identified the chain reaction of see, say and do. The first component, see, is a leader’s ability to grab the spotlight of attention and then focus it on something worthwhile. Strong leaders look for possibilities more often than problems and, as a result, they have the ability to see the upside. The say piece is how leaders start the conversation around an action. And then the do is the ability to take action in order to leverage that upside. When what you see, say and do is aligned to capitalize on the possibilities, you are “leading positive.” Q. Federal leaders are facing intense pressure to deliver results in an uncertain and tight fiscal environment. What techniques can they use to see the positive despite the challenges? A. Leaders should acknowledge the obstacles, but then make it clear that the organization intends to prevail in spite of the challenges. Use your mission and cause to inspire people, and make them invest and support one another with a culture of can-do and sacrifice. People will feel proud of making a sacrifice if the end gain is worth it. You see that especially in the public sector. People in this sector are used to doing more with less, and there’s nothing like a setback to wake you up and make you more creative. I like to call it realistic optimism. When you put what you cannot control out of the picture, what you’re optimistic about is human ingenuity. Q. How can individuals facing tough situations be realistically optimistic? A. Although it may seem difficult, harnessing a setback and using it to propel you forward can be exceptionally rewarding. For instance, I helped the Air Force when they decided to downsize for the first time. Some of their employees had planned for a 20-year career that was now abruptly ending, so I joined forces with Family Support Center to work not only with the enlisted people but also with the families. It takes an amount of adaptation time to figure out what you’re going to create for the rest of your life, but if you’re in a structured process that helps you, chances are that the end result will be very successful. Q. How do you define resilience? A. I see resilience as when you’ve had a big setback, in the form of either a big moment or a small moment, and it causes you to hit the reset button. You’ve been stopped on your way to an important goal, and the goal is blocked and there is no way around it. Resilience is figuring out what new goal, what new aspirations you are going to tap into so that you can keep going. Resilience is also about being analytical and creative simultaneously. You have to analyze and ask yourself, “Is this setback really it?” I tend to think of continuing down the same path as determination. I think of resilience as “I’m really stopped, and I have to figure out a new way.” Q. How can federal leaders more effectively communicate with their employees? A. Leaders do not realize how important they are in driving the change. They have a ripple effect that they often underestimate. People follow people, not just great ideas. Leaders have to put themselves into the equation – you are as important if not more so than any other strategy. People need to look at you, hear from you, and they need to know how much they matter. I like to tell people that substance is critically important. It’s your credibility card. You have to give people details about the substance — the details about how life and this organization will be different. The second element is the sizzle. You need to weave a story that has emotional value to your employees, whether it is an elevator speech or an hour town-hall meeting. The third element, soul, is the why: why you, the leader, care and why they, the audience, should care. It’s the leader’s skin in the game. How to take charge of your career Like On Leadership?

Federal prosecutors said the defendants had a \\"hatred and thirst for violence,\\" while defense attorneys argued that an FBI informant was the real culprit as opening arguments got underway Tuesday in the trial of four men accused in an alleged bomb plot. Prosecutors say the men plotted to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in May 2009 and also sought to fire missiles at planes at an Air National Guard base. James Cromitie, David Williams, Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen were arrested on May 20, 2009, allegedly after having placed what they thought were bombs at two sites and before making their way to Stewart Airport in Newburgh, New York. But no bombs went off that night. The men were part of a year-long sting operation led by a paid FBI informant. The bombs and missiles were not, in fact, armed, but were rather part of the FBI's masquerade. And defense attorneys are calling the situation entrapment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Hickey painted a picture in court of the defendants -- specifically, James Cromitie -- as having a \\"hatred and thirst for violence.\\" He described the four men as having cased and photographed targets, planned their escape, and talked about public reaction. All the while, a fifth man in their group, a man they knew to be \\"Maksud\\" and from whom they were receiving all their funding, was actually an FBI informant who had been taping their conversations and meeting with the FBI. Hickey described the informant, whose real name is Shaheed Hussein, as having been hired by the FBI to go to a certain mosque and listen for talk of violence against Americans. According to Hickey, Cromitie and Hussein met several times over a period of months, during which time Hussein convinced Cromitie that he was a representative of the Jaish a-Mohammed, a bogus international terrorism ring he said was based in Pakistan and was looking for recruits. Hickey further charged that Cromitie expressed his desire to \\"kill Jews\\" and make America \\"pay for Afghanistan and other Muslim countries,\\" recruiting Williams and Williams -- who are not related -- along with Payen to be part of the mission to target Jewish institutions and military operations in the United States. But defense attorneys argued that it was Hussein, not the four defendants, who planned, funded, and directed the entire operation, seducing the poverty-stricken defendants with food, gifts, and promises of a significant payday. The defense painted a picture of Hussein as a convicted felon who began working for the FBI as part of a plea bargain that kept him from jail and deportation, and paid him 100,000. Defense attorneys alleged that Hussein pressured the four men, whom, they said, he saw as his meal ticket, to agree to be a part of the mission, promising large sums of money and expensive cars and not taking no for an answer. They further alleged entrapment, as the defendants did not have violent pasts and \\"could not and would not have been involved in such a conspiracy without Shaheed Hussein.\\" Vincent L. Briccetti, attorney for Cromitie, called the 100 hours of videotaped conversations between the men \\"not a documentary but a work of fiction... a movie produced, directed, starred in, and edited by Shaheed Hussein and the FBI.\\" Suzanne Brody, attorney for Onta Williams, suggested the FBI was more interested in instigating and initiating, rather than investigating.

Furthermore, the reviewer's comparison of this movie to the creator's previous works highlights a sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment. The word \\"almost\\" is used to emphasize the point that the reviewer has been able to find something enjoyable in all of the creator's other movies, but this particular one falls short in meeting their expectations.

One of his pupils, Giovanni Soncini was the godfather of Corregio’s second daughter. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Bernardino Zacchetti was an artist","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, it is true that Bernardino Zacchetti was an artist. As an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, Zacchetti exhibited unique skill and mastery of his craft. The Renaissance period was a time of great artistic achievement, and Zacchetti's involvement in this movement places him alongside some of the most well-respected artists in history. Zacchetti's style evokes comparisons with the great artist Raphael, further solidifying his reputation as an accomplished artist, as Raphael is among the most celebrated painters of the Italian Renaissance. Additionally, Zacchetti is said to have collaborated with Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which is not only one of the most iconic artistic achievements in history but also a testament to his skills as an artist, as working alongside Michelangelo, another master, would have been an incredible honor. Furthermore, one of Bernardino Zacchetti's works, \\"St. Paul,\\" displayed in the church of San Prospero in Reggio Emilia, can be compared to the style of Il Garofalo, another renowned artist. It is through such critical assessments and interpretations of Zacchetti's artwork where his aptitude and expertise in his field become evident. Moreover, Bernardino Zacchetti's influence on the next generation of artists can be seen through his apprenticeship with Giovanni Soncini, who later became the godfather of Correggio's second daughter. Correggio was another esteemed painter of the Renaissance period, which suggests that the legacy of Bernardino Zacchetti as an artist prevailed through his student. In conclusion, the information in the paragraph provided confirms that Bernardino Zacchetti was an artist.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: \\"Teenager\\" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce  rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas  of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that \\"kids are getting older younger\\". With such maturity  at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion  conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children. Options: A Because companies are creating better products and services. B Because children education is becoming more important. C Because it is better to study music from an early age.

This will give us -9*r = -13 - 32. 2) The calculation of -13 - 32 gives us -45, so now the equation is -9*r = -45. 3) Now, we just need to divide both sides by -9 to get 'r'.  4) Finally, when you divide -45 by -9, you get 5.

Despite the tireless efforts of rescue teams, they have made the difficult decision to call off their search, unable to recover the victim's body. Step 1: Describe the incident The horrifying incident occurred when the unsuspecting victim, a resident of the Sunshine State, was suddenly swallowed up by the earth as a giant sinkhole formed under his home. The sinkhole, which measured approximately 20 feet across and 50 feet deep, caused the house to shift and collapse in the process, burying the poor man alive.  Step 2: Elaborate on the rescue operation Upon receiving news of this catastrophic event, local rescue teams responded swiftly, arriving on the scene equipped with heavy machinery and specialized tools aimed at safely extracting the trapped individual. The teams worked around the clock, digging through the debris and using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to locate the victim's body. Step 3: Explain the decision to call off the search As much as the rescue teams tried their best to recover the trapped individual, they faced challenges in the form of unstable soil conditions which put the brave men and women at risk. After days of relentless rescue attempts, the operation was declared too dangerous to continue, ultimately making the heart-wrenching decision to call off the search for the man's body. Step 4: Discuss the community's reaction This terrifying story has not only left an indelible mark on the family and friends of the victim but has also impacted the community deeply. Neighbors expressed their shock and disbelief, while local officials acknowledged the need for continued investigation into the causes and potential prevention of future sinkhole occurrences in the region.  Step 5: Concluding thoughts The unfortunate event in Florida highlights the unpredictable nature of sinkholes and serves as a haunting reminder of the potential hazards our natural environment can present. While the rescue teams could not bring the man's body home, their unwavering determination to help during this traumatic time will not be forgotten. Our thoughts remain with the victim's loved ones and community, as they attempt to come to terms with this devastating tragedy."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it. Question: What is probably true about Paul? Options: - not enough information   - He's a child   - He's a criminal   - He's Chloe's father === The correct answer is A:","output":"He's a criminal"},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge? from the following article ?  The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces,...

The presentation appears to be complete and detailed. But a professional historian would have taken a different tack. Personally, I feel that Chief Justice Rehnquist presentation was excellent.I particularly liked the Chief Justice's analysis of what might have been Justice Bradley's thought processes in arriving at his opinions. I do not believe that a professional historian could have provided this type of insight into the situation. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"The review depicts the product in a flattering light.  Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the author presents facts like a lawyer, suggesting that the narrative is well-structured and thorough. Though they note a professional historian might have approached the topic differently, this does not necessarily indicate a weakness; it simply showcases a unique perspective.  Secondly, they express personal admiration for the Chief Justice Rehnquist's presentation, deeming it excellent. This reveals high satisfaction with the product.  Lastly, they express their belief that a professional historian wouldn't have provided the unique insight that the Chief Justice's analysis did, giving the product additional value for its unique perspective.

Write an article based on this summary: Republican Donald Trump asserted that Democrat Hillary Clinton and her campaign team first raised questions about Barack Obama's birthplace in 2008 - and that he was the man who settled the issue in 2011. Article:","output":"Title: Debunking the Birther Controversy: The Origins And Resolutions Of Questions Surrounding Barack Obama's Birthplace The 2008 elections marked an eventful historical moment in the United States, as the country elected its first African-American president, Barack Obama. However, the campaigning period was no stranger to controversy either. One issue that continues to endure even years after the election is the \\"birther\\" controversy. Democrat Hillary Clinton and her campaign team were accused of raising questions about Barack Obama's birthplace in 2008, an accusation which resurfaced during the 2016 election between Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Trump asserts that he was the one who settled this issue in 2011. This article aims to provide an account of the origins and outcome of the controversy surrounding Obama's birthplace. During the 2008 democratic primaries, tensions were high as the battle for the nomination intensified between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Some Clinton supporters began circulating rumors that Obama was not a natural-born citizen of the United States, suggesting he was born in Kenya. These rumors were based on the false claim that his late father's nationality disqualified Obama from meeting the requirements of the U.S. Constitution, which strictly requires the president to be a natural-born citizen. Although the Clinton campaign did not officially endorse these claims, many believe that the rumors were spawned by her supporters in an attempt to discredit Obama. While the claims did not gather much traction in the beginning, they were intensified by Donald Trump as he publicly questioned Obama's birthplace in 2011. Trump, a notable businessman and reality TV star at the time, called on Obama to release his long-form birth certificate and questioned why the president had not already done so. Many criticized Trump's statements as divisive and racially charged, but his persistence seemed to pay off when Obama finally released the long-form birth certificate, confirming his birth in Hawaii in August 1961. The release of Obama's birth certificate appeared to put the issue to rest. However, it resurfaced during the 2016 presidential election as Trump accused Clinton of starting the birther controversy during her 2008 campaign. This claim, while not entirely true, did have some basis in fact, as some of her supporters were known to raise the question in the past. Nonetheless, the majority of the rhetoric from the Clinton 2008 campaign focused on policy differences with Obama, not on his birthplace or eligibility for the presidency. It is worth noting that Trump's assertion that he settled the birther issue in 2011 may be flawed. While the release of Obama's birth certificate was prompted partially by Trump's questioning, Obama had produced his short-form birth certificate in 2008, which was deemed sufficient proof by the State Department. The dispute continued largely because of the undue emphasis placed on the issue by individuals such as Trump, who championed the conspiracy theory and fanned the flames of doubt. In conclusion, the birther controversy surrounding President Barack Obama's birthplace began during the 2008 election campaign with rumors circulated by some Clinton supporters. Although the controversy might not have been initiated by Hillary Clinton herself, the rumors persisted until 2011 when Trump called for the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate. Although Trump claims that he settled the issue, the short-form birth certificate released in 2008 provided ample evidence to dispel any doubts. The controversy stands as a testament to the political gamesmanship and the divisive role that conspiratorial accusations can play in shaping public opinion during an election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Siobhán Emma Donaghy (born 14 June 1984) is an English singer-songwriter. She was a founding member of girl group the Sugababes and Mutya Keisha Siobhan. Donaghy left the Sugababes in 2001 following arguments and accusations in the trio with Keisha Buchanan. Donaghy released her debut solo album, \\"Revolution in Me\\", on 23 September 2003, which contained three single releases. Her second studio album, \\"Ghosts\\", was released on 25 June 2007. Donaghy appeared in a remixed version of the hit stage show \\"Rent\\" (titled \\"Rent Remixed\\") for its 20072008 run, playing the role of Mimi alongside Denise Van Outen.  - Sweet 7 is the seventh and final studio album by British girl group the Sugababes, released on 15 March 2010, by Island Records. It marks as the final release from the fourth line up following them splitting in 2011. Production for the album began in April 2009 and was completed in January 2010. \\"Sweet 7\\" is the only release since the controversial departure of Keisha Buchanan, who was replaced by 2009 Eurovision Song Contest entry Jade Ewen in September 2009. As a result of the group line-up change, \\"Sweet 7\\" was re-recorded to feature the vocals of new member Ewen and for the removal of former member Buchanan's vocals. As a result, this is the only album that features none of the original members.  - London Records is a record label in the U.K. that marketed records in the U.S, Canada, and Latin America from 1947 to 1979 before becoming semi-independent.  - Jade Louise Ewen (born 24 January 1988) is an English singer, songwriter, actress and a former member of the band Sugababes. Ewen began her singing career in a girl group named Trinity Stone, which signed with Sony BMG in 2005 but disbanded in 2007 without releasing an album. In 2009, after winning the right, she represented the United Kingdom in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest by performing the Andrew Lloyd Webber penned \\"It's My Time\\". She finished in fifth place, making her the most successful British Eurovision act since 2002. She is well known for her Connie Francis-like vocals.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - \`\` Shape '' is a song by English girl group Sugababes , released as the fourth and final single from their second studio album , Angels with Dirty Faces ( 2002 ) .

It features the Sugababes at a masquerade ball in a mansion . The Sugababes performed \`\` Shape '' on GMTV , at the V Festival , and on tour in support of their albums .  - Dominic Miller (born 21 March 1960) is an Argentinian-born British-American guitarist best known for his involvement in Sting's projects for over 20 years. Together they wrote \\"Shape of My Heart,\\" which would be sampled by various artists, including in hit songs for Craig David and the Sugababes. He has released several solo albums.  - The Sugababes were an English girl group, formed in 1998 with founding members Siobhán Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. Their debut album, \\"One Touch\\", was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label. With the introduction of Heidi Range, former member of fellow English girl group Atomic Kitten, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success whilst keeping the critical acclaim they had achieved with their debut album. They released three studio albums before Buena announced her departure in December 2005, leading to Amelle Berrabah being brought in to replace her. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two studio albums. In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, \\"Sweet 7\\", in 2010, after which they signed to RCA Records, before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In 2013, Ewen confessed that the Sugababes had split two years earlier. The original line-up of the band reformed in 2011, under the new name Mutya Keisha Siobhan.  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Amelle Berrabah (born 22 April 1984) is an English singer, songwriter and former member of the Sugababes who replaced founding member Mutya Buena in the group in December 2005. She achieved a solo number one single in 2009 after collaborating with Tinchy Stryder on their single \\"Never Leave You\\", making her the first and to date only member of the Sugababes to achieve a number one single outside the group.  - Heidi India Range (born 23 May 1983) is an English singer-songwriter.

The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression.  - Doo-wop is a genre of music that was developed in African-Americans communities of New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles in the 1940s, achieving mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (19141978) is often called the \\"Godfather of Doo-wop\\" for his introducing the \\"top and bottom\\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.

David has 20 UK top 40 singles, and seven UK top 40 albums, selling over 14 million records worldwide as a solo artist.  - A girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally harmonize together. The term \\"girl group\\" is also used in a narrower sense in the United States of America to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups, many of whom were influenced by doo-wop, and which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and start of the British Invasion.  - Keisha Kerreece Fayeanne Buchanan (born 30 September 1984) is an English singer-songwriter and was a founding member of the BRIT Award-winning girl group the Sugababes alongside Mutya Buena and Siobhan Donaghy, and later Heidi Range and Amelle Berrabah. With the Sugababes, Buchanan had six number one singles and two number one studio albums, making the Sugababes one of the most successful British pop acts of the 21st century. Buchanan was asked to leave the group in September 2009 and was replaced by Jade Ewen.  - \\"Shape of My Heart\\" is a song by American boy band Backstreet Boys. The song was released on October 3, 2000 as the lead single from their fourth studio album, \\"Black & Blue\\" (2000). It was written and produced by Max Martin and Rami Yacoub, and co-written by Lisa Miskovsky. The song debuted at number nine on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 in the United States, while reaching number eight on the \\"Billboard\\" Top 40 Mainstream chart.  - The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Atomic Kitten are an English pop girl group formed in Liverpool in 1998 whose current members are Natasha Hamilton, Kerry Katona and Liz McClarnon. The band was founded by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) frontman Andy McCluskey, who served as a principal songwriter during their early years. Sugababes singer Heidi Range was included in the original line-up but was replaced by Hamilton. The group's debut album \\"Right Now\\" was released in October 2000 and peaked at number 39 in the UK. After four top ten singles, Katona quit the group and was replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost. \\"Whole Again\\" (recorded before Katona left), their next single, became their most successful single when it topped the UK singles chart and became the 13th best-selling single of the 2000s. The group re-released their debut album, with some tracks re-recorded with Frost's vocals. In the UK, the album hit number one, going double platinum after selling over 600,000 copies.  - Rosa Isabel Mutya Buena (born 21 May 1985) is an English recording artist who rose to fame as a member of girl group the Sugababes. With the Sugababes, Buena had four UK number one singles, an additional six top-ten hits and three multi-platinum albums.

Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. The Nabokovs settled in Manhattan and Vladimir began volunteer work as an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History.  Nabokov joined the staff of Wellesley College in 1941 as resident lecturer in comparative literature. The position, created specifically for him, provided an income and free time to write creatively and pursue his lepidoptery. Nabokov is remembered as the founder of Wellesley's Russian Department. The Nabokovs resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts, during the 1941-42 academic year. In September 1942 they moved to Cambridge where they lived until June 1948. Following a lecture tour through the United States, Nabokov returned to Wellesley for the 1944-45 academic year as a lecturer in Russian. In 1945, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He served through the 1947-48 term as Wellesley's one-man Russian Department, offering courses in Russian language and literature. His classes were popular, due as much to his unique teaching style as to the wartime interest in all things Russian. At the same time he was the de facto curator of lepidoptery at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. After being encouraged by Morris Bishop, Nabokov left Wellesley in 1948 to teach Russian and European literature at Cornell University, where he taught until 1959. Among his students at Cornell was future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who later identified Nabokov as a major influence on her development as a writer.  Nabokov wrote Lolita while travelling on butterfly-collection trips in the western United States that he undertook every summer. Vera acted as \\"secretary, typist, editor, proofreader, translator and bibliographer; his agent, business manager, legal counsel and chauffeur; his research assistant, teaching assistant and professorial understudy\\"; when Nabokov attempted to burn unfinished drafts of Lolita, it was Vera who stopped him. He called her the best-humored woman he had ever known.  In June 1953 Nabokov and his family went to Ashland, Oregon. There he finished Lolita and began writing the novel Pnin. He roamed the nearby mountains looking for butterflies, and wrote a poem called Lines Written in Oregon. On 1 October 1953, he and his family returned to Ithaca, New York, where he would later teach the young writer Thomas Pynchon.

Two tiger cubs are playing when the second cub (later named Sangha) comes upon a young civet. Sangha chases the civet into its burrow and the mother civet appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The first tiger cub (later named Kumal) appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Eventually, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect the cubs.

Since early 2009, the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point. Even with allowance  and special government policies, home prices in China's first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave. According to the \\"2010 China Marital Status Report\\" released on Dec 15, 2010, about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing, a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage. From the report, we can see that housing is given top priority  and that women see an apartment as essential  to show that the man is responsible and can provide for his family. Personality and morals lay outside the top three matrimonial  requirements. Some women and their families hold the traditional position and take it for granted that the home issue should be the man's responsibility, which doesn't agree with the contemporary independent spirit of women and gender equality. These marriage values reflect the fact that many women consider marriage another form of \\"social welfare\\". Things may be different overseas.

She also made sure to talk to her best friend, Sam, because friends can help and support each other. It took some time for Alexis to notice changes in her body, but she didn't give up. She kept lifting weights and eating her healthy meals, and slowly, she started feeling better about herself. She was proud of the hard work she was putting in to lose weight. After a few months, Alexis noticed that her clothes were fitting better, and she had more energy to play with her friends. Her friends and family noticed too and were really proud of her. And guess what? Alexis didn't just lose weight and get healthier, she also made new friends and inspired them to start their own exercise routines. Now, Alexis, Sam, and their new friends exercise together and support each other on their health journeys. It's like a big team of happy, healthy people who love to lift weights and eat yummy, low calorie meals!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identify the key elements in the question. 2. Research or recall the names of prominent Hungarian composers. 3. Investigate their works to find the one that matches the description given. Step 1: Identifying the key elements: - Hungarian composer - Piece for solo piano - Containing Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences Step 2: Research or recall the names of prominent Hungarian composers. Some notable Hungarian composers are Franz Liszt, Béla Bartók, and Zoltán Kodály. Step 3: Investigate their works to find the one that matches the description given. - Franz Liszt's works are primarily focused on the Romantic era, and there isn't any evidence of the mentioned rhythmic influences in his pieces. - Béla Bartók is famously known for his extensive research on folk music from Eastern Europe and combining their rhythmic elements in his compositions. One of his famous pieces for solo piano is the \\"Allegro barbaro,\\" which features various Eastern European influences. - Zoltán Kodály is also known for his interest in folk music, but his primary focus has been on music education, and none of his compositions for solo piano seems to match the description given.

CONTEXT: Ésta es la tercera Conferencia Intergubernamental para reformar los tratados que se convoca en los últimos diez años, después de las que concluyeron en los tratados de Maastricht (1991) y Amsterdam (1997). Los Quince se han marcado en esta ocasión un plazo más corto para alcanzar un acuerdo para cumplir su promesa de que la UE esté lista el 1 de enero del 2003 para acoger a aquellos Estados que concluyan sus negociaciones de adhesión. Se ha tenido en cuenta que los parlamentos nacionales necesitarán al menos dos años para ratificar el nuevo Tratado. Ésta es una de las razones que llevaron a acordar que se limiten las negociaciones a la reforma de los tres capítulos que quedaron pendientes en las negociaciones del Tratado de Amsterdam: el número de miembros de la Comisión Europea, los votos de cada país en el Consejo de Ministros y la extensión de las decisiones que se adoptan por mayoría cualificada. Estas tres modificaciones son las mínimas que deben hacerse para evitar que se paralice el funcionamiento de las instituciones cuando la UE tenga 20 ó 25 Estados miembros, cifra que hará muy difícil adoptar decisiones por unanimidad. Sin embargo, la Comisión Europea propondrá, como ya adelantó Prodi en Helsinki, que se aborden otra serie de asuntos, entre ellos la posibilidad de recurrir a la \\"cooperación reforzada\\" para que los Estados que quieran realizar políticas en común no se vean frenados por el resto, como sucede ahora en materia de armonización fiscal, por ejemplo.

Which company did both computer scientist Gerrit Blaauw and computer architect Gene Amdahl work for?","output":"Both computer scientist Gerrit Blaauw and computer architect Gene Amdahl worked for IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), a multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York. Gerrit Blaauw, a Dutch computer scientist, is one of the principal designers of the IBM System/360, along with his colleagues, including Gene Amdahl and Fred Brooks. This line of mainframe computers was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964. The System/360, in particular, was significant because it was one of the first computer systems that allowed machines of different capacities and technologies to use the same peripherals and software, which was certainly revolutionary for its time. Blaauw was mainly in charge of system structure and hardware architecture in the development of the System/360. Gene Amdahl, on the other hand, was a distinguished American computer architect and high-tech entrepreneur. He played a considerable role in the development of the IBM System/360, serving as the chief architect. After his time at IBM, Amdahl founded the Amdahl Corporation, a computer manufacturer company, where he created mainframe computers that competed with those of IBM. The Amdahl Law, which is used to find the maximum improvement possible by enhancing a particular part of a system, is named after him. In summary, though both Blaauw and Amdahl worked at IBM and made substantial contributions towards the development of the System/360, their careers took different trajectories. Blaauw contributed to the field primarily academically, while Amdahl also established his own corporation to rival IBM in the computer market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who confronts George and Ursula? from the following article ?  In an animated sequence, a plane flying through the fictional Bukuvu region in the heart of Africa crashes. A child on board the plane, George, disappears into the jungle and is raised by a sapient, talking gorilla named Ape. Twenty-five years later, George, who enjoys swinging on vines to move about but has a habit of crashing into trees, has grown to be King of the Jungle. Ursula Stanhope, a San Francisco heiress, tours Uganda with local guide Kwame and a trio of porters. Ursula is tracked down and joined by her fiancé, Lyle Van De Groot, with two poachers named Max and Thor. Kwame tells the group of the \\"White Ape\\", a local legend of a superhuman primate that rules the jungle. The next day Lyle, insistent on taking Ursula home as soon as possible, goes into the jungle with her to find the White Ape and they are attacked by a lion. Lyle knocks himself out trying to flee while Ursula is saved by George. George takes Ursula to his treehouse home and cares for her, introducing her to Shep, an African bush elephant that acts like George's dog, and Tookie, a toco toucan. George is smitten with Ursula and attempts to woo her; Ursula reciprocates his attraction, and her time spent with George makes her no longer wish to return home. Lyle, Max and Thor find the treehouse and Lyle confronts Ursula and George. Max and Thor make to shoot Shep for his ivory, and Ape shouts at Shep to run. Everyone is stunned by the sight of a talking ape and Max and Thor decide to tranquilize and capture him. George runs to stop them and is accidentally shot by Lyle, who thought his gun was a novelty lighter. Lyle and the poachers are imprisoned and Lyle is identified as the shooter by the porters; Max and Thor are released and resolve to capture Ape to make a fortune in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Ursula takes George home to get medical help for his wound and to see the human world he belongs in.

During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

Question: Who does Barry leave at the hospital? Movie title: Punch-Drunk Love Movie plot: Barry Egan is a single man who owns a company that markets themed toilet plungers and other novelty items. He has seven overbearing sisters who ridicule and emotionally abuse him regularly and leads a lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and anguish. In the span of one morning, he witnesses an inexplicable car accident, picks up an abandoned harmonium from the street, and encounters Lena Leonard, a coworker of his sister's, Lena having orchestrated this meeting after seeing him in a family picture belonging to his sister Elizabeth. Coping with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone-sex line, but the operator attempts to extort money and sends her four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and amass a million frequent flyer miles by buying large quantities of pudding. After Lena leaves for Hawaii on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He arrives and calls one of his manipulative sisters to learn where Lena is staying. When his sister starts abusing him again, Barry snaps and demands she give him the information, which she does. Lena is overjoyed to see Barry, and they later have sex. At first, Barry explains that he is in Hawaii on a business trip by coincidence, but he soon admits that he came only for her. The romance develops further, and Barry finally feels some relief from the emotional isolation he has endured. After they return home, the four brothers ram their car into Barry's, leaving Lena mildly injured. With his new-found freedom from loneliness in jeopardy, a surprisingly aggressive and poised Barry adeptly fights off all four of the goons in a matter of seconds, using a tire iron as a weapon.

Continue writing the following text. We returned the drill and opted to purchase a hammer, since the","output":"walls we were working with were made of a softer material that didn't require the power of a drill to penetrate them. After evaluating the available options, we settled on a high-quality, well-weighted hammer. This choice not only fit our budget but also allowed us better control and precision during our renovation project. As we proceeded with our task, we found that using a hammer provided several advantages over using a drill. The most apparent was the ease with which the hammer made holes in the softer walls. This allowed us to work at a brisk pace, getting the project done more quickly than we had initially anticipated.  Additionally, the hammer caused less noise and vibrations, making the work environment much more pleasant for ourselves and anyone around us. The reduced noise also eliminated the need for hearing protection, which we would have needed when using a drill. Despite the hammer's effectiveness, we also took care to select the right type of nails and fasteners for the job. These choices were crucial to reinforcing the connection between the wall and the items we were hanging, such as framed art and shelves. We opted for steel nails, as they offered the perfect combination of strength and versatility for our purposes. Furthermore, we chose anchor screws with plastic wall plugs for heavier objects, ensuring stability in the long run. To further enhance our work, we invested in a quality stud finder. A stud finder is a tool that locates the wooden frame behind the wall's surface. Attaching items into the studs is essential when hanging heavier objects, as it provides a stable and secure connection that can handle the added weight. We mapped out the locations of the studs with a pencil and made sure to anchor our items into these points. Throughout our renovation project, we learned that selecting the right tools and materials for a task is critical for achieving a successful outcome. By opting for a hammer over a drill, we were able to efficiently and effectively complete our wall work without causing unnecessary damage or noise. Furthermore, by combining the hammer with appropriate nails, fasteners, and a stud finder, we ensured the security and longevity of the items we hung. In conclusion, our decision to purchase a hammer was a wise one that served us well during the renovation project. It demonstrated that choosing the right tool for the job is crucial in achieving the desired results. The ease, noise reduction, versatility, and control provided by using a hammer further cemented its status as a reliable option for working with softer walls. These advantages made the investment worthwhile, leading to a successful and satisfying renovation project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Lily bought some new clothing at the mall. She put it in her car and took it somewhere. Where might she take it? - closet - yard sale - drawer - trunk - house  The best answer is","output":"house.  When considering where Lily might take her new clothing, it is important to think about the context and logical possibilities for each option provided. Let us analyze each option in detail: 1. Closet: A closet could be a potential destination for new clothing. Generally, people store their clothing in closets, where it can be organized according to their preference. However, since the closet is located inside a house, this option is a more specific location within the broader context of the house. Therefore, it may not be the best answer on its own. 2. Yard sale: While a yard sale may be a place where one could purchase second-hand clothing, it is very unlikely that Lily would take her new clothing items to a yard sale immediately after purchasing them from the mall. Yard sales are typically meant for selling items that one no longer needs or wants – not newly purchased items. 3. Drawer: Similar to a closet, a drawer is another location where clothing is typically stored. This option is also within the broader context of a house, making it a more specific location within that environment. A drawer could be a suitable destination for Lily's new clothing, but it is not the best answer in and of itself. 4. Trunk: While a trunk could refer to the storage compartment of a car, it could also refer to a large, lockable storage box often used for additional storage. In either case, this option does not seem to be the most logical location for Lily's new clothing. New clothing items are typically meant to be worn, and storing them in a trunk does not make much sense. 5. House: Among all the options provided, taking the new clothing items to her house seems to be the most logical and appropriate choice.

Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning.  Question: suppose there are more clouds that build up happens, how will it affect MORE or MORE POWERFUL lightning.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"The formation of more clouds that contribute to the build-up of electrostatic charges can lead to an increased frequency or intensity of lightning, depending on various factors. So, the answer would be A: more or more powerful lightning. However, it is essential to understand the underlying factors and processes to comprehend why this is the case. Cloud Formation and Growth When there are more clouds developing in an area, they can merge and form more extensive and denser cloud formations, which can lead to an increased likelihood of lightning. This occurs when warm, moist air near the surface rises and meets cooler air at higher altitudes. As the temperature drops, the water vapor condenses into tiny water droplets and ice particles, forming clouds. As these clouds continue to grow and develop, they can create ideal conditions for lightning generation. Building Electrostatic Charges As clouds expand and evolve, the water droplets and ice particles within them inevitably collide with each other, generating electrostatic charges. These charges accumulate as the particles continue to crash into one another, resulting in the separation of positive and negative charges within the cloud. The lighter, positively charged particles concentrate toward the top of the cloud, while heavier, negatively charged particles position themselves in the lower section. Development of Thunderclouds When a significant amount of electrostatic charges build up within clouds, they transform into thunderclouds (or cumulonimbus clouds). These clouds are much thicker and have a larger vertical extent, providing an optimal environment for electrical discharges like lightning. The strong updrafts and downdrafts within these clouds further enhance the charging process, leading to more potent electrical fields. Attraction of Positive and Negative Charges The negatively charged particles in the lower part of the cloud induce the Earth's surface (mountains, trees, or taller structures) to become positively charged. The separation of these negative and positive charges increases the electrical potential between the cloud and the ground, which can render the air in between them an excellent conductor for electrical discharges. When the electrical potential between the cloud and the ground is strong enough, it results in a lightning strike. Effect of More Clouds on Lightning Given the processes described above, it becomes evident that when there are more clouds in an area, there is an increased likelihood of electrostatic charge build-up and thundercloud formation. This increase, in turn, contributes to the potential for more frequent or more powerful lightning. However, it is crucial to note that other factors, such as atmospheric stability, humidity, temperature, and local topography, also play critical roles in lightning development and intensity. In conclusion, the presence of more clouds in a given area can lead to increased frequency or intensity of lightning due to enhanced opportunities for electrostatic charge build-up and thundercloud growth. Various factors influence this relationship and may either amplify or diminish the potential for more or more powerful lightning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts  Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day  or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air.

A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is amongst Roger Taylor's most famous songs in the Queen catalogue. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording.  Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\". The song is dedicated to him, the album says: \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\".  When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury.  The song was often played live during the 1977-81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with The Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar.

Interestingly, when it was time to release the album's first single, Taylor was extremely enthusiastic about his song that he convinced Freddie Mercury to use \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" as the B-side to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" reportedly locking himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. Even though it generated some internal friction within the band due to the equal publishing royalties, this became a significant decision.  \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" was frequently performed live between the period of 1977 to 1981 where Taylor performed the song from his drum kit, while Mercury contributed on piano and added backing vocals. The song even found its way into the setlists for the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008, highlighting its sustained resonance.

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive? OPT: a. negative; b. positive; The answer is:","output":"a. negative The movie review sentence provided describes the film in an overwhelmingly negative light. Each word used to characterize the film highlights various aspects of negativity. Here is a breakdown of each term and its connotation: 1. Messy: This word suggests that the film is disorganized or disorderly, which indicates a lack of care in the creation process. This reflects negatively on the filmmakers, as a polished and well-thought-out production is typically more favorable to audiences. 2. Uncouth: Describing something as uncouth implies that it is rude, impolite, or lacking in social grace. In the context of a film review, this might refer to crude humor, offensive language, or inappropriate content that diminishes the overall quality of the movie. 3. Incomprehensible: This term indicates that the film is difficult to understand, which can be a significant issue for viewers who desire a clear and concise storyline. An incomprehensible movie might have convoluted plotlines or muddled storytelling, detracting from the audience's enjoyment and leaving them feeling confused. 4. Vicious: By describing the film as vicious, the reviewer emphasizes its brutal or unpleasant nature. This could be in reference to graphic or disturbing content, or extreme violence. A vicious movie might feel unnecessarily cruel and off-putting to many viewers, making it a negative trait. 5. Absurd: Lastly, the word absurd suggests that the film contains ideas or situations so preposterous that they defy reason or common sense. While some movies might aim for absurdist comedy or satire, the use of absurd here likely implies that the ridiculous aspects of the film do not serve a purpose and ultimately detract from the quality of the movie. In summary, the review sentence points to a broad range of negative traits, suggesting that the film is far from praiseworthy. Thus, the answer is negative (option a), as none of the descriptors included in the sentence reflect any positive aspects of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: To peel garlic.","output":"Peeling garlic can be a time-consuming and somewhat tricky task, but there are a few different techniques that can make the process easier and more efficient. Here is a detailed explanation of the best way to peel garlic using various methods: Method 1: Using the flat side of a knife 1. Firstly, separate the garlic cloves from the head. You simply need to apply some pressure with your fingers to break the head apart and remove individual cloves. 2. For this method, you need a broad, flat knife, preferably a chef's knife. Lay the unpeeled garlic clove on a cutting board with the flat surface facing upwards.  3. Place the flat side of the knife on top of the garlic clove, making sure that it completely covers the garlic. 4. With the palm of your hand, give the knife a firm whack. The force applied will slightly crush the clove and break the peel. 5. Now, you can easily remove the broken skin with your fingers, as it should loosen and separate from the clove. Method 2: Shaking in a closed container 1. Separate the cloves from the head of garlic, as described earlier. 2. Choose a hard and closed container, such as a mason jar, a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, or two metal bowls that fit together. Place the cloves inside the container. 3. Close the container or seal the bowls together to make sure they won't open during the shaking process.  4. Shake the container or bowls vigorously for about 15-30 seconds. The force of shaking will create friction, causing the skins to peel off from the cloves. 5. Open the container and check the garlic cloves. Most, if not all, should have their skins removed. If some are still not peeled, simply shake for a few more seconds. Method 3: Using a silicone garlic peeler 1. Separate the garlic cloves from the head as before. 2. Purchase a silicone garlic peeler, a handy kitchen tool designed specifically for peeling garlic. These are usually inexpensive and available at most kitchen supply stores or online retailers. 3. Place a clove of garlic inside the silicone tube and press down slightly to ensure it has contact with the tube. 4. Roll the tube back and forth with your hand, applying gentle pressure. The friction created by the silicone material will loosen the skin from the clove. 5. After a few seconds of rolling, the skin should be separated from the clove, and you can simply remove the peeled garlic. Method 4: Using warm water 1. First, separate the cloves from the head of garlic. 2. Fill a bowl with warm (not boiling) water. 3. Submerge the garlic cloves in the warm water and let them sit for around 5-10 minutes. The warm water will help soften the skin, making it easier to peel. 4. Remove the cloves from the water and use your fingers or a small knife to peel back the softened skin. Each of these methods has its advantages and may work better for different situations or individual preferences. No matter which method you choose, the task of peeling garlic should become much simpler and more efficient. Happy cooking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Many children develop a stutter in their first few years of speaking, but while many of them lose the stutter within a year or two, this does not mean you shouldn't help them through it. Speech therapists who are not up to date on modern research may recommend \\"waiting until it goes away,\\" but it is a far better idea to be conscious of the child's stutter and follow the steps below. If you tend to be a fast speaker, it's possible the child may be copying you by speaking too fast for their language abilities. Try slowing down your speech just a little, keeping a natural rhythm, and make sure you speak clearly. Give the child time to speak at a time and place where they are not being teased or interrupted. If the child is excited about telling you something, pause what you are doing and listen. Children who do not feel they have a place to speak may feel more anxiety over their stutter or become less willing to talk. Increase the confidence of the child by listening in a supportive way while they speak. Don't try to finish their sentence for them, and don't walk away or interrupt when they stuck. A relatively modern type of stuttering treatment for children is a system of parental feedback, such as the Lidcombe Program developed in the 1980s. In these systems, a therapist trains the parent or caretaker to assist the child instead of enrolling the child in a therapy program directly. Even if you cannot find a suitable program near you, you can benefit from some of the tenets of this program.  Talk to the child about the stutter only if the child wants to. Compliment the child when they speak without stuttering or have a day with lower levels of stuttering. Do this once or twice a day at consistent times, rather than making a big deal of the stutter by repeating the praise often. Rarely give negative feedback by pointing out the stutter. Don't do this when the child is upset or frustrated. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article highlights the importance of actively helping children who develop a stutter during their early years, instead of waiting for it to resolve on its own. It is essential to be conscious of the child's stutter and employ several strategies to support them. These strategies include slowing down your speech, providing them with a comfortable environment to speak, increasing their confidence by actively listening without interruption, and considering specialized therapy programs like the Lidcombe Program. The parental feedback in such programs trains parents to assist the child, offering praise when they speak without stuttering and avoiding negative feedback. Overall, it is crucial to support and empower the child as they work through their stutter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This statement claims that the Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001), prepared by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), was published in December 2000.

Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  I am facing a new situation today: Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.

Her complexion was glowing with excitement as she often looked forward to her winter retreats in the sunny lands of Mexico. \\"Hello, Fiona,\\" Betty greeted, beaming at the sight of her trusted neighbor. \\"I'm so relieved you could come by.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? utter mush ... conceited pap .","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence \\"utter mush ... conceited pap,\\" let us closely examine the individual words and their meanings to grasp the overall emotion being conveyed. 1. \\"Utter mush\\": The word \\"utter\\" is an adjective that means complete or absolute, while \\"mush\\" refers to something with weak or inferior consistency. In this context, it is used figuratively to describe something that lacks substance or depth, such as a poorly-written piece of work or an illogical argument. The combined phrase \\"utter mush\\" suggests that the speaker has strong negative feelings about the subject at hand. 2. \\"Conceited pap\\": The word \\"conceited\\" is an adjective describing someone or something that is excessively proud, self-important, or vain. \\"Pap\\" is a term used to describe bland or insipid content, often in reference to reading material, television programs, or other media. When the two words are combined into the phrase \\"conceited pap,\\" it implies that the subject is not only insubstantial but also pretentious and self-important, which adds to the negative sentiment. Considering the meanings and connotations of both \\"utter mush\\" and \\"conceited pap,\\" the sentiment of the given sentence can be identified as negative. The speaker expresses intense displeasure and criticism, finding the subject to be both devoid of substance and insufferably self-focused. The use of both phrases serves to emphasize their dissatisfaction, revealing a strongly negative sentiment overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. What does the man make his children do now that he is grown?

Information:  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Gulls, often referred to as seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.  - The black tern ( Chlidonias niger or Chlidonias nigra ) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water in Europe and North America . As its name suggests , it has predominantly dark plumage . In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season , hence the old English name \`\` blue darr '' . The scientific name means \`\` like a swallow '' .  - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow.  - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Terns are seabirds in the family Sternidae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Previously considered a subfamily of the gulls, Laridae, they are now usually given full family status and divided into eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.  - The name marsh tern refers to terns of the genus \\"Chlidonias\\", which are typically found in freshwater marshes, rather than coastal locations. The genus name \\"Chlidonias\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"khelidonios\\", \\"swallow-like\\", from \\"khelidon\\", \\"swallow\\".  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Inca tern (\\"Larosterna inca\\") is a seabird in the family Sternidae. It is the only member of the genus \\"Larosterna\\".  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Plumage (\\"feather\\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs.  - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .  - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\".  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life.

His owners trained him from a young age to find his toys. When they say the name of a certain toy, Rico can find it. In fact, he seems to know the names of 200 toys! Some researchers in Germany wanted to test Rico. They put his toys in a room and then told him to go in the room and find a certain toy. Since nobody was in the room with Rico, he had no help from anyone finding the right toy. The researchers did this test forty times. Rico found the right toy thirty-seven times! Then the researchers tried something else. They put seven of Rico's toys in the room together with one new toy that Rico had never seen before. Then they told Rico to go into the room and get the new toy. This new toy had a name Rico had never heard before. Rico found the right toy seven out of ten times! Researchers cannot really say that Rico knows words or language. However, these tests seem to show that Rico can think about what he hears and think about what he knows. In fact, Rico seems to think and remember things as well as a three-year-old child. From these tests, animal researchers know one thing for sure. Rico has given them a lot to think about.

Cellular respiration is a process that takes place in cells where organic compounds are broken down, and energy is produced in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In aerobic respiration, oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, allowing for the efficient production of energy.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In physics, gravitational acceleration is the acceleration on an object caused by the force of gravitation. Neglecting friction such as air resistance, all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass. This equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies.  - The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) (the Metric system) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the \\"International Prototype of the Kilogram\\" (IPK, also known as \\"Le Grand K\\" or \\"Big K\\").  - An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily on airliners. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled.  - The International System of Units (; abbreviated as SI) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - Miniature dachshunds have a typical weight of 8 to 11 pounds in the United States . They also are normally a height of 5 to 7 inches at the withers . They are nicknamed \`\` wiener dogs '' , \`\` hot dogs '' or \`\` sausage dogs '' .  - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).  - Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.  - Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how \\"tall\\" something is, or how \\"high up\\" it is. For example \\"The height of the building is 50 m\\" or \\"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.  - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.  - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.  - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \\"W\\", is the product of the mass \\"m\\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration \\"g\\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

Given the question \\"How would you describe Bailey?\\", is \\"sad about everything\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Given the question, \\"How would you describe Bailey?\\", the answer \\"sad about everything\\" does not appear to be a valid answer based on the information provided in the statement: \\"Bailey went to see the circus and loved every minute of it.\\" To elaborate further, let's analyze the context and provided information. In the original statement, Bailey is described as enjoying their time at the circus, evidenced by the phrase \\"loved every minute of it.\\" This tells us that Bailey had a positive experience at the circus, finding joy in the performances and overall atmosphere. The choice of the word \\"every\\" implies that there was not a single moment during the circus in which Bailey experienced any sadness or lack of enjoyment. On the other hand, the suggested answer, \\"sad about everything,\\" is a direct contradiction to the information provided, painting Bailey as a perpetually unhappy individual. Based on the evidence given, it is clear that Bailey had a positive and perhaps even exhilarating experience at the circus, which contradicts the notion that they are sad about everything in their life. Further, when asked to describe someone, it is generally more appropriate to provide a comprehensive response that includes various aspects of their character, such as personality traits, hobbies, or preferences, rather than focusing solely on a single emotion or temporary feeling. Thus, even in a hypothetical scenario where Bailey did have some sadness in their life, it would not be a comprehensive or accurate depiction of them to solely label them as \\"sad about everything.\\" In conclusion, given the information provided in the statement about Bailey's experience at the circus, the answer \\"sad about everything\\" does not accurately describe Bailey. Instead, a more fitting description reflecting their experience at the circus could be: \\"Bailey is someone who enjoys and finds joy in entertainment, such as circuses, and is capable of having a great time in such lively environments.\\" Additionally, it may be beneficial to ask for more information about Bailey to create a well-rounded portrayal of their character."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the Diaper Genie, pointing out various issues they have encountered while using the product. Some of the negative aspects mentioned include: 1. The Diaper Genie is only effective for newborns (1-3 months), and it becomes less useful as the baby grows older (4 months and beyond) due to the increased odor from the diapers. 2. The smell from the diapers begins to leak out of the Diaper Genie as the child gets older, and the reviewer states that the interior of the genie starts to have an awful smell, like something has died in it. 3. Difficulty in replacing the refill is another concern mentioned by the reviewer, as it seems to be a problematic process for them. 4. Additionally, the review highlights that different refill types are sold next to each other, and the reviewer ended up receiving the wrong refill type for their Diaper Genie at their baby shower, making it incompatible with their wide genie. This resulted in them throwing away the refill and losing money as a consequence. These reasons indicate that the reviewer does not recommend the Diaper Genie to potential buyers, making the overall tone of the review negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Tesla’s market value soars, but some see a bubble In the past month, Tesla’s stock value has doubled to more than 90 a share. That gives the California-based company a total market value of 10.6 billion, greater than that of Italian automaker Fiat, worth less than 8 billion. Such dramatic success, and the brash confidence of founder Elon Musk, has some fans calling Tesla the first successful new American car maker in more than a generation. But some analysts say the electrifying rise is not what it seems. Take that Fiat comparison: In the first quarter of this year, Fiat sold 1 million cars and made a 40 million profit. Tesla sold 4,900 cars and, not counting the sale of regulatory credits under California law, lost 53 million, or more than 10,000 per car. Whether or not Tesla survives or thrives has become an important test of U.S. policy and automotive strategy. The Energy Department gave it a 465 million low-interest loan; President Obama has delivered generous subsidies for electric vehicles. While the sale of electric cars will fall far short of Obama’s goals, Musk is taking an unconventional approach to establishing his brand. Instead of trying like the Chevy Volt to compete with moderately priced cars, Musk has wooed wealthy buyers with a sleek, four-door sedan that handles like a sports car and can cost more than 80,000. He plans to work his way down toward the mass market with future models. Doubters have been waiting for Tesla to run out of cash, which it seemed poised to do last year, but it hasn’t. And Musk is moving to take advantage of the high stock price. On Wednesday, Tesla announced that it would raise 830 million in new stock and debt offerings, which it would use to repay ahead of schedule its oft-criticized loan from the Energy Department. Musk said he himself would buy 100 million of the offerings, and the stock climbed still higher. But some analysts still say the company’s share price is a bubble on a par with foamy tech-era stocks. It is selling for roughly 600 times its estimated 2013 earnings. Moreover, Tesla would have booked a first-quarter loss without the 68 million sale of special credits created by California regulations that reward makers of “zero-emission” vehicles. The ZEV credits have provided more assistance to Tesla than have generous federal incentive programs. California’s Air Resources Board has mandated that large-volume sellers of cars must together meet a minimum quota of 7,500 zero-emission vehicles this year and next. Those who fall short must buy credits from those who produce more than their share. Tesla’s strategy of building cars with 200-mile ranges dovetails with the ZEV rules, which say that cars with a 100-mile range get three credits per vehicle, while those with a 200-mile range get four. Long-range cars with 15-minute recharging capability get five credits, and Musk has hinted that a faster recharging device will soon be unveiled.","output":"The article highlights Tesla's rise in the automotive industry, with its market value recently doubling to 10.6 billion, surpassing that of Italian automaker Fiat. This impressive success has led some to deem Tesla the first successful new American carmaker in over a generation. Despite its soaring market value, Tesla’s profitability is questioned, as it sold only 4,900 cars in the first quarter of 2013 compared to Fiat's one million, resulting in a loss of 53 million for Tesla.  The company’s survival has been attributed to support from U.S. policy, including a 465 million low-interest loan from the Energy Department and subsidies for electric vehicles from the Obama administration. Elon Musk, the company’s founder, has also adopted an unconventional business approach that entails initially targeting wealthy buyers with high-end, electric sports cars then gradually expanding to the mass market with future models.  Tesla recently raised 830 million through new stock and debt offerings, allowing it to avoid potential bankruptcy and even repay its loan from the Energy Department. Musk committed to buying 100 million of the offering, further raising the company’s stock price.  However, some analysts caution that Tesla's share price could be a bubble, akin to those seen during the tech boom era. The firm's stock is reportedly selling for approximately 600 times its estimated 2013 earnings.  Additionally, Tesla's profitability is being propped up by the selling of Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits, a scheme created by California law to incentivize zero-emission vehicles. Without the 68 million procured from the sale of these credits in the first quarter, Tesla would have reported a loss. This dependence on ZEV credits, rather than direct sales, has led some analysts to question the sustainability of Tesla's current financial standing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, we cannot make any definite assumptions about their familiarity with the target practice location as there is no direct mention or hint in the paragraph. It is possible that they could have been familiar with the location, as Fred had a specific intention to teach his son, which could suggest that he has taken part in target practice before.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

And tonight they're in their element. I'm hiding at the back of the room getting slowly drunk with the event's organiser, an entrepreneur who helped raise a ridiculous sum of money for a business networking site that had projected revenues of precisely zero. His mantra, he tells me, is 'revenue is the enemy'. It's not clear what that means, but I have to admit it sounds great. A microphone is being passed around and we're watching and listening as a succession of young - mostly under forty - men - they're mostly men - rattle off their CVs and their future plans.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

But when they took it home to Eric's mother, she guessed it was probably just a cow's bone and it sat on a shelf in the dining room for months. It was only when she finally contacted a paleontologist in November they realised they had in fact found a second vertebrae in the spinal column of an American mastodon. 'Oh my gosh, we were liked psyched,' said Eric, from Shelby Township, after learning of his discovery, which he made in a branch of the Clinton River in June. Thought it belonged to a cow: The bone was a second vertebrae in the spinal column of a mastodon (pictured) which roamed America until their extinction around 10,000 years ago. Mastodons lived from about the Oligocene of the Paleogene period, about 30 million years ago, in North and central America until about 10,000 years ago. Although similar to elephants and woolly mammoths, they are not that closely related. They are thought to have become extinct due to nomadic hunters and an abrupt climate change when temperatures plunged to glacial conditions. 'I thought it was a rock at first, but a. couple minutes later I looked more at it. I didn't think it was a. dinosaur bone, but I wasn't sure.' The mastodon, which resembles a woolly mammoth although not closely related, roamed the plains of North and Central America until their extinction around 10,000 years ago. John Zawiskie, a geologist and paleontologist at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, rushed over to Eric's house to tell them the news. He told CNN: 'Every once in a while - by construction workers or exploring 11-year-old boys and girls - something like this comes to the forefront and reminds us of the incredible history of Earth's landscape.' Eric is now preparing to give his science class their 'coolest' show-and-tell ever. 'I feel really special,' he said. 'People said it's just amazing how I found this.'

Given the following context:  The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflection to signify its return to the nest to its mate.  answer the following question:  What animals' flocks make a quiet chattering sound while at rest? Answer:","output":"Australian raven flocks make a quiet chattering sound while at rest. They use this form of communication to interact with each other in a low-key manner when they are not actively engaging in territorial calls or other forms of vocalization. These quiet chattering sounds serve as contact calls, allowing the birds to maintain social bonds and stay connected with one another even when they are not actively moving or foraging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Using a lawn mower that's running, walk back and forth pushing it over the grass to be cut. If you go diagonally it gives it a cool look. (ii). Borrow a goat from a nearby farm if you don't own one and let that goat hang out in the yard as long as possible so it can eat the grass and keep it cut. Answer:","output":"Though both options for mowing the lawn have their unique advantages, the best way to maintain a healthy and visually appealing lawn largely depends on various factors such as the size of the lawn, grass type, available resources, and personal preferences. Let's compare both options and evaluate which one will best suit different circumstances: Option (i) - Using a lawn mower: 1. Time-efficient: A lawn mower is designed for specific purpose of cutting grass and is able to cover a much larger area in a shorter amount of time when compared to a goat. 2. Control over grass length: Lawn mowers provide you with the ability to adjust the cutting height, offering more precise control over the length of your grass. 3. Lawn patterns: As mentioned in the input, mowing the lawn diagonally or following alternate patterns can give your lawn a cool look, which is something that cannot be easily achieved with a goat. 4. Mulching and bagging capabilities: Lawn mowers often come with additional features like mulching or bagging clippings that can help maintain the health of your lawn. 5. Safety: Lawn mowers have safety features designed to protect the user, whereas managing a goat can be less predictable, especially for those who do not have experience handling animals. Option (ii) - Borrowing a goat: 1. Environmentally friendly: Goats can offer a more eco-friendly approach to mow a lawn, as they don't produce emissions like a traditional gas-powered lawn mower. 2. Fertilization: Goats produce natural fertilizer while grazing, which can be beneficial for the soil. 3. Weed control: In addition to grass, goats also eat weeds and other unwanted vegetation, helping you to maintain a more weed-free lawn. 4. Low maintenance: Goats can graze at their leisure and do not require regular upkeep like lawn mowers do in terms of cleaning, oiling, and blade sharpening.  However, the issue of practicality and range of control may arise when using a goat. The size of the lawn, the time taken to trim it, and the consistency of the maintained height are aspects that cannot be easily managed with a goat. In conclusion, the best way to mow the lawn largely depends on individual preferences and circumstances. For those who prioritize precision, speed, and visual patterns, using a lawn mower would be the best option. On the other hand, if the focus is on eco-friendliness and weed control without the need for perfectly manicured grass, borrowing a goat might be the most suitable choice. However, for most people, a lawn mower is likely to be the more practical and efficient solution for maintaining their lawn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Who is Jessica in a relationship with? Movie title: Kissing Jessica Stein Movie plot: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother... The answer is:","output":"Jessica is in a relationship with Helen Cooper in the movie \\"Kissing Jessica Stein.\\" Helen is a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who placed a newspaper advertisement seeking a lesbian relationship, and Jessica, disillusioned with her blind dates with men, decides to respond to and explore a relationship with Helen.

Write an article based on this \\"A website that accused Google of abusing its position in the search market by \\"driving traffic\\" to Google Maps has lost its High Court action.\\"","output":"Title: High Court Rejects Accusations of Google Abusing its Search Market Position to Drive Traffic to Google Maps  Subtitle: Major legal victory for Google in High Court Action The High Court has recently ruled in favor of Google in a case where the tech giant has been accused of abusing its dominant position in the search market to drive traffic to Google Maps. The website that brought the allegations against Google had claimed that the company's practices resulted in an unfair advantage for its own mapping platform while pushing down search results for competing map services. This court decision is significant as it reflects a respite for Google amidst growing concerns and scrutiny over the power it wields in the search market. Background of the Case The accusing website had argued that Google's algorithm was specifically designed to favor its own services, including Google Maps, over competitors such as Bing Maps, Apple Maps, or other local mapping services. The website claimed that due to Google's overwhelming dominance in the search market, it effectively acted as a gatekeeper for online platforms. Further, it asserted that Google's alleged favoritism toward its own services unfairly distorted competition in the search market, making it difficult for other mapping services to gain traction and attract users. Google's Defense Arguing against the allegations, Google maintained that it did not tamper with or abuse its search algorithms to give undue benefits to its own products. The company stated that any prominence of Google Maps in search results was a consequence of its platform's popularity, high-quality user experience, and efficiency in providing accurate and relevant information quickly. Moreover, Google stressed that it continuously improves its search algorithms to ensure users receive the most relevant and helpful results for the queries they enter, irrespective of the service providing the information. Key Points from the High Court's Decision In its ruling, the High Court rejected the website's claim that Google had abused its position in the search market. Some of the key points from the decision include: 1. The court found that the website failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating anti-competitive behavior on Google's part or proving that the search results were manipulated to favor Google Maps. 2. The court acknowledged that while Google enjoys a dominant position in the search market, this alone does not amount to abuse of the market. 3. The court pointed out that consumers have the freedom to choose competing map services if they wish to do so, and Google does not prevent users from accessing these alternatives. 4. The court also emphasized that Google Maps' prominence could be attributed to its high-quality service, popularity, and brand recognition. Implications of the Decision The High Court's ruling in favor of Google can be considered a significant victory for the company, which has faced mounting regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges in various jurisdictions. This decision signals a reinforcement of the idea that enjoying a dominant market position does not automatically translate into anti-competitive behavior. However, it also highlights the need for careful assessment of market practices to ensure a level playing field for companies competing in the digital space. While Google has emerged victorious in this case, the broader debate around the power wielded by Big Tech companies, including Google, is far from over. This case underlines the importance of ongoing discussions on market dominance, competition, and ensuring fair digital market dealings. As technology continues to evolve, it remains crucial for industry players, regulators, and policymakers worldwide to navigate these complex issues with sensitivity and insert appropriate checks and balances to protect both businesses and consumers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Last year we visited prefix = st1 /Stratford, the place where Shakespeare was born on the 23rd of April, 1564.

In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled \\"Surgery\\", with the lyrics \\"calling Dr. Dre to surgery\\" serving as the chorus to the song. He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop. \\"Surgery\\", which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group's official formation, would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntable. The record would become the group's first hit, selling 50,000 copies within the Compton area.  Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam. Dr. Dre's earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled Concrete Roots. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described the compiled music, released \\"several years before Dre developed a distinctive style\\", as \\"surprisingly generic and unengaging\\" and \\"for dedicated fans only\\".  His frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school's swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for him to get a job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.

Just moved to town and am searching for a gym.  I'm not too far from Gold's Gym so checked it out on Saturday, January 18.  It was PACKED, which is fine, just not used to seeing so many people at a gym on a beautiful Saturday around lunchtime.  I filled out paperwork and was seated at a table to wait for someone to give me a tour.  Shortly after, an employee (Christine) came by to give us the tour.  I'm sorry to say, she seemed like she couldn't get us out of there fast enough - it was a quick walk around, pointed out a few things, the end.  I had to ask about the tanning (I saw the sign on the very fast tour, but she didn't mention it), I had to ask about class schedules, and about child care.  The reason I visited Gold's Gym was because of a flyer I received in the mail, which included a 7 day pass.

Plot title: The Hills Have Eyes 2 Movie plot: A captive womanâforced to breed mutant childrenâgives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights... My question: What does the search party discover?

Options: - jump - clap - smile - feel happy - watch television  Explain why a human would choose \\"clap\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"clap\\" to answer the question above because clapping is a universal and socially accepted way of expressing appreciation, approval, or enjoyment of a performance. Let's break down each option step by step: 1. Jump - Jumping is not a typical response to show appreciation for a performance. While it may indicate excitement or joy, it doesn't directly communicate appreciation to the performers. 2. Clap - Clapping is a common and highly visible way of expressing appreciation and approval. It is a physical act that generates sound, making it both visible and audible to the performers and the audience. Hence, it effectively communicates the message that the audience enjoyed the show. 3. Smile - Smiling can indeed be an expression of enjoyment or appreciation. However, it is a more subtle response that is not as explicitly communicative as clapping. Smiling may not be seen or heard by the performers on stage, making it less effective in conveying the appreciation. 4. Feel happy - Feeling happy is an internal emotional response that cannot be directly communicated or observed by others, especially the performers. Though it may imply appreciation, it doesn't directly express it. 5. Watch television - Watching television is irrelevant to the question, as it is an entirely separate activity not linked to expressing appreciation for a live show. Looking at all the given options and analyzing them, a human would choose \\"clap\\" because it is the best way to express their appreciation for a show in a way that is clearly communicated, observable, and understood by the performers and fellow audience members."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who was posing for Moore? is inside the article: On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein.  1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London.  In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore., can you guess it ?

Given the question \\"How would Carson feel afterwards?\\", is \\"happy\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"No, \\"happy\\" would not be a valid answer. Justification:  1. The natural first step is to analyze the statement. Carson had been studying all week, showing his dedication and commitment towards the History test. However, despite his efforts, he failed the test. The common human emotional response to such an outcome, especially after putting in a significant amount of effort, would generally be disappointment, sadness, or frustration. 2. The next logical step is to align this analysis with the suggested emotion - happiness. Happiness normally is associated with positive outcomes or achievements, which contrasts with failing a test, especially after diligent preparation. 3.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Who gains the most from affirmative action, according to Eastland?\\"  Context: \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"  Answer: A:","output":"According to Eastland, the individuals who gain the most from affirmative action are primarily the most fortunate among the preferred groups, such as upper and middle-class minorities. Eastland argues that the benefits of affirmative action often go to those who do not need it, instead of reaching the intended disadvantaged individuals.

Act 2: - While arranging a lavish, public celebration in honor of the Queen's upcoming birthday, Richelieu and Don Alfonso execute a daring and dangerous scheme to abduct King Louis and Queen Marie-Thérèse during the festivities.  - With the monarchs now in his custody, Richelieu attempts to manipulate the French government from the shadows while maintaining the illusion of a stable and functioning kingdom. - However, suspicion quickly arises as the King's loyal Musketeer, Captain Armand (played by Chris Hemsworth), begins to suspect foul play and launches an investigation into the couple's sudden disappearance. Act 3: - Captain Armand uncovers evidence of Richelieu's treachery and assembles a team of dedicated Musketeers to infiltrate the Cardinal's hidden fortress where the King and Queen are being held.  - Simultaneously, Queen Marie-Thérèse uses her intelligence and charm to sow discord among their captors, weakening their allegiance to Richelieu and Don Alfonso.  - As chaos erupts within Richelieu's ranks, Captain Armand and his team strike, engaging in a thrilling series of swashbuckling battles throughout the fortress.  Act 4: - The climactic conclusion sees Richelieu and Don Alfonso cornered, with their dreams of power at an end. Cornered by Captain Armand, Richelieu is forced to choose between loyalty to his country and his own ambitions for power.  - In a surprising turn of events, Richelieu turns on Don Alfonso, choosing to protect the French royal couple rather than watch his nation crumble. He ultimately loses his life in the process. - With the plot foiled and the King and Queen freed, France is returned to stability, and Richelieu's sacrifices gain him posthumous recognition for his ultimate loyalty to the crown, despite his initial treacherous actions. The Cardinal's Gambit is a tale of intrigue, power, and the depths people will go for their own ambitions.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What recording did Gramophone magazine vote the greatest recording of all time in 1999? ?  Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine. A:","output":"The greatest recording of all time, as voted by Gramophone magazine in 1999, is Sir Georg Solti's recording of Wagner's \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen.\\" This recording was made in Vienna between 1958 and 1965 and was produced by John Culshaw."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a more detailed and accurate answer: The ten plagues that God cursed Pharaoh and Egypt with, as mentioned in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, were sent to make Pharaoh let the Israelites go free from slavery. The ten plagues are as follows: 1. The Plague of Blood - God turned the Nile River, as well as other water sources in Egypt, into blood. 2. The Plague of Frogs - Egypt was infested with a massive number of frogs. 3. The Plague of Lice or Gnats - The dust of the earth was turned into lice or gnats, infesting humans and animals. 4. The Plague of Flies or Wild Beasts - Swarms of flies or wild beasts invaded Egypt, causing havoc and destruction. 5. The Plague on Livestock - God struck down the Egyptian livestock, killing horses, cattle, and other animals. 6. The Plague of Boils - Boils and sores broke out on humans and animals. 7. The Plague of Hail - Severe hailstorms caused massive destruction to crops and properties, and killed people and animals caught outside. 8. The Plague of Locusts - Locusts swarmed over the land, devouring all remaining crops. 9. The Plague of Darkness - Egypt was engulfed in darkness for three days, so dark that people could not see one another or move from their places. 10. The Plague of the Firstborn - God struck down the firstborn children of all Egyptians, including Pharaoh's own son. This final plague ultimately led to Pharaoh finally releasing the Israelites from captivity, and triggered their exodus from Egypt."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since 1921, Guernsey has been in currency union with the United Kingdom and the Guernsey pound is not a separate currency but is a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling, in a similar way to the banknotes issued in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). It can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes (see also sterling zone). Question: can you use guernsey money in the uk?  a. no b. yes","output":"b. Yes, you can use Guernsey money in the UK, but it is important to note that it may not be widely accepted by all businesses and establishments, especially those outside of the main tourist areas.  The Guernsey pound is a local issue of banknotes and coins that are denominated in Pound Sterling, and it has been in a currency union with the United Kingdom since 1921. Therefore, Guernsey money has the same value as the UK's Pound Sterling. However, due to the different designs and issuers, Guernsey banknotes and coins may not always be readily accepted in the UK, even though they are of the same worth.  Many people visiting or living in the UK might prefer to exchange their Guernsey pounds for UK Pound Sterling notes and coins before making transactions. This can be easily done at most banks, post offices, currency exchange bureaus, or even some larger hotels. It is essential to be aware of this potential limitation when planning to use Guernsey money in the UK since not every merchant or service provider may be willing to accept it. It could be more convenient to exchange the Guernsey pounds for UK Pound Sterling before making purchases or transactions to avoid any potential issues or complications. And finally, while Guernsey money can legally be used in the UK, and although it is on par with the UK Pound Sterling, it is still a good idea to keep in mind that the acceptance of this currency may vary depending on the location and the specific establishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Western Movie The best answer to the question \\"Someone probably used more than one horse to make one of these?\\" is option C, a Western movie. The other options, A, B, D, and E, do not fit the context of the question as well as a Western movie does.  Option A, horseradish, is a plant that does not involve the use of horses for making it. Option B, a farmyard, may include horses, but it is a location rather than something made by the presence of horses. Option D, Canada, refers to a country and is unrelated to using horses to create something. Option E, a racetrack, is a place where horse races may occur, but it is not necessarily created using multiple horses for its construction or creation.  On the other hand, Western movies often depict scenes that involve the use of multiple horses. These movies are known for their portrayal of cowboys, horse riding, and other elements of the Wild West. Horses play a central role in Western movies by showcasing skills like horseback riding, racing, and other aspects of cowboy life.

Avoid wearing tight pants made from synthetic materials, such as spandex. Instead, choose clothing that is loose fitting and made from a breathable natural material, such as cotton.","output":"This helps keep the genital area dry and ensures that air can circulate, reducing the chances of yeast overgrowth. Maintain proper hygiene by regularly washing your genital area with mild soap and water, and always dry the area thoroughly afterward, as yeast thrives in damp environments. Keep your immune system strong by eating a balanced and nutritious diet, getting enough sleep, staying physically active, managing stress, and avoiding smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Limit your sugar intake, as high blood sugar levels can disrupt the balance of your body's natural flora and promote the growth of yeast. Opt for unscented and dye-free personal care products, especially when choosing laundry detergent, toilet paper, and feminine hygiene products. This can help avoid irritation and disruption to the natural balance of your body's microbiome. When taking antibiotics, only use them as prescribed by your doctor, as taking more than necessary or using them improperly can destroy the good bacteria in your body, allowing yeast to grow unchecked. Incorporate probiotics into your daily routine through your diet or through supplements. Probiotics help maintain the balance of the good bacteria in your body, creating a hostile environment for yeast growth. You can find probiotics in foods like yogurt, kefir, miso, and certain fermented foods, or in supplement form at your local health food store. Change out of damp clothing, such as workout gear or swimwear, as soon as possible. If you tend to sweat a lot, consider using moisture-absorbing materials to help keep the genital area dry. When using the toilet, always wipe from front to back, to avoid spreading bacteria from the rectum to the vaginal area. Practice safe sex and use protection every time, to reduce the risk of yeast infections and other sexually transmitted infections. Hormonal birth control, including oral contraceptive pills and IUDs, can sometimes lead to an increased risk of yeast infections due to hormonal imbalances, so discuss with your healthcare provider if this might be a factor for you. Finally, be aware of any personal habits or environmental factors that may be contributing to an imbalance in your body’s natural flora, and work to address these issues. Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help identify any underlying issues and offer guidance on managing yeast infections.

OPTIONS: i. yes ii. it is not possible to tell iii. no","output":"ii. it is not possible to tell To determine whether the second sentence is true based on the first sentence, we need to carefully analyze both sentences and understand their underlying implications. Sentence 1: \\"I am not an anti-smoking nut either, just as long as I can stay away from it.\\" This sentence suggests that the speaker is not fervently against smoking, but they would prefer to stay away from it. The key point to consider here is the speaker's preference to avoid direct contact or proximity with smoking, but without a strong opposition to smoking itself. Now let's consider Sentence 2: \\"I like to stay away from smoking but I don't care if someone does it in the same room.\\" This sentence also suggests that the speaker avoids smoking, which is consistent with the first sentence. However, the second half of the sentence \\"but I don't care if someone does it in the same room\\" implies that the speaker is comfortable with someone smoking in their presence. This idea seems to contradict the desire to stay away from smoking in Sentence 1. Given this analysis, there is not enough information provided in Sentence 1 to definitively say whether the second sentence is true or not. The preferences of the speaker regarding being in the same room as a smoker are not entirely clear from the first sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is \\"ii. it is not possible to tell.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Based on the sentence \\"A swan taking off from a lake\\", is the sentence \\"A bird taking off flying into the air.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A bird taking off flying into the air\\" can be considered a true sentence when compared to \\"A swan taking off from a lake.\\" Here's a detailed explanation as to why: 1. Taxonomic classification: Swans belong to the biological class Aves, which encompasses all birds. Thus, referring to a swan as a bird is accurate, as it is part of the broader bird category. By replacing \\"swan\\" with \\"bird\\" in the second sentence, the statement still holds true based on the taxonomic classification. 2. Action/event: In both sentences, the primary action depicted is the act of taking off. In the first sentence, it is specified that the swan takes off from a lake. While the second sentence does not explicitly mention the swan's departure point, it does focus on the act of flight, which is consistent with the first sentence's meaning. It is reasonable to infer that when a bird takes off from a lake, it will be flying into the air, thus making the second sentence true in terms of the action involved. 3. Context: The sentences share a similar context - a bird, specifically a swan in the first sentence, is engaging in the act of taking off and commencing flight. While the second sentence lacks the same level of detail as the first one, it still presents a true statement within the given context, as it describes a bird engaging in the act of flight. In conclusion, although the second sentence \\"A bird taking off flying into the air\\" is less specific and descriptive than the first sentence \\"A swan taking off from a lake,\\" it can still be considered a true statement and shares a similar meaning. This is due to the fact that swans are part of the larger bird classification, both sentences depict an act of taking off, and the context of the two sentences is fundamentally the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: A big debate among the Pando staff for the past two years has been over just how morally bankrupt Uber is. Earlier this evening, a bombshell story by Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith proves the reality is way worse than anyone on our team could have expected.      And that’s saying something.      Back in 2012, Paul Carr first raised serious concerns about the company’s view that both riders and drivers are disposable commodities in an all-out Randian battle to maximize profits. He uninstalled the app when he wrote that piece, and he started a drumbeat of press around these concerns.      Then, in 2014, Carmel DeAmicis exposed that an Uber driver accused of assault had a criminal record that should have been uncovered by the background checks Uber claimed to do. She further documented a “blame the passenger” culture at the company when such complaints came up.      It started to snowball: An investigation at The Verge exposed cut throat competitive tactics that the company has taken against its primary competitor Lyft.      Then, a few weeks ago, I wrote a story about the outrageous sexism woven deeply into the culture of the company. We’ve seen it in the company’s PR team discrediting female passengers who accuse drivers of attacking them by whispering that they were “drunk” or “dressed provocatively.”      We’ve seen it in CEO Travis Kalanick’s comments that he calls the company “boober” because of all the tail he gets since running it.      And on October 22, we saw it again with an offensive campaign in Lyon that encouraged riders to get picked up by hot female drivers, essentially a scary invitation to objectify (or worse) any woman working for the company. That ad was taken down once exposed by Buzzfeed, but sources tell us no one was fired for taking that kind of “initiative.” We also heard that Kalanick’s misogyny is such a problem that recently hired political operative David Plouffe had made it a priority to work on the CEO’s behavior. As if that kind of misogyny-- and encouragement of it in a corporate culture-- is something that careful media training can repair rather than simply disguise.      I have known many of Uber’s key investors and founders personally for six to ten years. Over that time I’ve seen an ever-worsening frat culture where sexist jokes and a blind eye here-or-there have developed into a company where the worst kind of smearing and objectification of women is A-ok. It’s impossible to prove that Kalanick directly ordered things like slut-shaming female passengers or the creepy Lyon ad -- and, to be clear, there’s no evidence he was personally involved in either of those scandals -- but let’s be clear: The acceptance of this kind of behavior comes from the top.      When I saw the Lyon post, it was finally enough for me. As a woman and mother of two young kids, I no longer felt safe using Uber and deleted the app from my phone.      And yet, somehow, despite years now of Pando carefully chronicling this disturbing escalation of horrible behavior -- which has been considered cute by many of the other tech blogs and excused away by the VCs profiting off Uber-- the company still has the ability to shock and horrify me.      Today, in his horrifying scoop, Smith writes about the the lengths that at least one Uber executive, Emil Michael, was willing to go to discredit anyone-- particularly a woman-- who may try to question how Uber operates.      Ruining her life? Manufacturing lies? Going after her family? Apparently it’s all part of what Uber has described as its “political campaign” to build a 30 billion (and counting) tech company. A campaign that David Plouffe was hired to “run,” that’s looking more like a pathetic version of play acting House of Cards than a real campaign run by a real political professional. Because step one of an illegal smear campaign against a woman is: Don’t brag about it to a journalist at a party.      The woman in question? The woman that this Uber executive has vowed to go to nearly any lengths to ruin, to bully into silence? Me.      I first heard of this when Smith called me for comment over the weekend. I was out late at a work dinner in London and stepped out into the cold to take the call. A chill ran down my spine that had little to do with the weather, as he described the bizarre interaction. I immediately thought of my kids at home halfway around the world, just getting out of their baths and groggily pulling on their pajamas, and how the new line that this company was willing to cross would affect them.      We are used to intimidation here. We’ve had sources try to intimidate Pando into silence by withholding access, threatening 300 million lawsuits, spreading lies about our relationships with our backers-- or even suggesting that we’re funded by the CIA. We have mobs unleashed on us on Twitter, seemingly weekly.      So my concern wasn’t more lies winding up online about me. Sadly, I’ve had to get used to it. My concern was that the nature of these lies weren’t the same trumped up bullshit about Pando being influenced by its investors. That smear hasn’t worked, and we share several investors with Uber, so that dog doesn’t exactly hunt.      No, these new attacks threatened to hit at my only vulnerability. The only part of my life that I’d do anything to protect: My family and my children.      In that moment outside an Indian restaurant in London, I stood numb listening to Smith asking me if I had a comment, and I thought of my kids. They were somewhere covered in kitten and dinosaur pajamas giggling and running through the house in a last ditch effort to fight bedtime. Maybe they were looking up at the moon, remembering how many times I’ve told them I’d always be somewhere looking at the same moon even if I couldn’t be there to rock them.      I had two thoughts. The first was: What possible comment could I give Smith to sum up the terror I felt over an attack at my family?      And then this: Please, God, let this be how bad it gets. Please let the worst of this be that I have to one day have the “Mommy has a lot of people who hate her because of what she writes…” conversation with them.      I begged no deity in particular that the escalation of dangerous, win-at-all-costs, no-matter-the-casualties warfare Uber has waged on anyone-- drivers, riders, or journalists-- who crosses them could just end here. That it could just end with a wild plan of lies and character assassination of me, personally. I could weather that.      Sadly, I don’t see any reason to think it will. Unless forces more powerful than me in the Valley-- or even Washington DC-- see this latest horror as a wakeup call and decide this is enough. That the First Amendment and rights of journalists do matter. That companies shouldn’t be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters. That all these nice words about gender equality in tech aren’t just token board appointments every once in a while. That professional women in this industry actually deserve respect. That they shouldn’t be bullied with the same old easy slurs about bitchiness or sexual objectification. That deep scary misogyny in a culture isn’t something that you hire a campaign manager to “message out” of a founder, nor is it something you excuse as genius at work. That there is a line someone can cross, even amid an era where the Valley believes founders can never be fired.      Simply put: That this isn’t OK.      I’ve seen other times the Valley’s greed has tiptoed into this range. It came out that HP pretexted reporters, illegally spying on them to find out where leaks were coming from. There was the time that Facebook hired Burson-Marsteller to persuade journalists to attack Google. And we’ve chronicled a shocking wage collusion suit that unfairly suppressed the wages of millions.      Each time the Valley’s soul was pulled back to center not because the bad actors in question suddenly had a crisis of confidence, but because powerful forces made them recalibrate. HP was hauled into court. Facebook was exposed in the press and shamed into changing tactics. And the only reason the wage collusion pact didn’t ultimately succeed was because emerging powerhouses like Facebook and LinkedIn refused to take part. That’s still winding its way through the courts, and the victims may eventually get something close to restitution.      Uber’s dangerous escalation of behavior has just had its whistleblower moment, and tellingly, the whistleblower wasn’t a staffer with a conscience, it was an executive boasting about the proposed plan. It’s gone so far, that there are those in the company who don’t even realize this is something you try to cover up. It’s like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood. Only one with billions of dollars of assets at his disposal.      And lest you think this was just a rogue actor and not part of the company’s game plan, let me remind you Kalanick telegraphed exactly this sort of thing when he sat on stage at the Code Conference last spring and said he was hiring political operatives whose job would be to “throw mud.” I naively thought he just meant Taxi companies. Let me also remind you: This is a company you trust with your personal safety every single time you use it. Let me also remind you: The executive in question has not been fired.      Uber has more than thirty investors including:      Menlo Ventures      Google Ventures      Kleiner Perkins      Summit Partners      Blackrock      Benchmark      TPG Growth      Jeff Bezos      Troy Carter      CrunchFund      Goldman Sachs      Scott Banister      Alfred Lin      Lowercase Capital      First Round      Naval Ravikant      Jason Calacanis      Shervin Pishevar      (UPDATE: An earlier version of this post listed 500 Startups as an Uber investor, based on their listing on Crunchbase. Dave McClure has responded in the comments to say that they are not.)      I've already started to reach out to the major ones individually to ask, on the record, whether they will continue to publicly and privately support the company in light of these most recent scandals. Whether there is any line that Kalanick can cross that goes too far. And I’m encouraging anyone concerned about this dangerous escalation of the Uber playbook-- from callous libertarian to boasting brogrammer to deeply bullying and misogynist leader of a massive company-- to ask the same questions.      The story I wrote a few weeks ago had enough of an impact that those within Uber decided they need to destroy me personally at any cost. The market is turning on Uber, seeing the company’s soul for what it is. With any luck, Ben Smith’s scoop will finally force real change from the inside.      UPDATE: Emil Michael called my cell phone shortly after I published this and asked to talk off the record. I'm not entirely sure how he got my phone number as I've never met or previously spoken with him. I told Michael that I would not talk to him off the record. This is an issue of vital importance to our readers, Uber's riders, journalists and women in the Valley, and I will not have a conversation I can't share with them. He said goodbye and hung up.      UPDATE II: After the above update, Michael sent me the following email... ||||| A senior executive at Uber suggested that the company should consider hiring a team of opposition researchers to dig up dirt on its critics in the media — and specifically to spread details of the personal life of a female journalist who has criticized the company.      The executive, Emil Michael, made the comments in a conversation he later said he believed was off the record. In a statement through Uber Monday evening, he said he regretted them and that they didn't reflect his or the company's views.      His remarks came as Uber seeks to improve its relationship with the media and the image of its management team, who have been cast as insensitive and hyper-aggressive even as the company's business and cultural reach have boomed.      Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year as its senior vice president of business, floated the idea at a dinner Friday at Manhattan's Waverly Inn attended by an influential New York crowd including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington. The dinner was hosted by Ian Osborne, a former adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant to the company.      At the dinner, Uber CEO and founder Travis Kalanick, boyish with tousled graying hair and a sweater, made the case that he has been miscast as an ideologue and as insensitive to driver and rider complaints, while in fact he has largely had his head down building a transformative company that has beat his own and others' wildest expectations.      A BuzzFeed editor was invited to the dinner by the journalist Michael Wolff, who later said that he had failed to communicate that the gathering would be off the record; neither Kalanick, his communications director, nor any other Uber official suggested to BuzzFeed News that the event was off the record.      Michael, who Kalanick described as \\"one of the top deal guys in the Valley\\" when he joined the company, is a charismatic and well-regarded figure who came to Uber from Klout. He also sits on a board that advises the Department of Defense.      Over dinner, he outlined the notion of spending \\"a million dollars\\" to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists. That team could, he said, help Uber fight back against the press — they'd look into \\"your personal lives, your families,\\" and give the media a taste of its own medicine.      Michael was particularly focused on one journalist, Sarah Lacy, the editor of the Silicon Valley website PandoDaily, a sometimes combative voice inside the industry. Lacy recently accused Uber of \\"sexism and misogyny.\\" She wrote that she was deleting her Uber app after BuzzFeed News reported that Uber appeared to be working with a French escort service. \\"I don't know how many more signals we need that the company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety,\\" she wrote.      At the dinner, Michael expressed outrage at Lacy's column and said that women are far more likely to get assaulted by taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said that he thought Lacy should be held \\"personally responsible\\" for any woman who followed her lead in deleting Uber and was then sexually assaulted.      Then he returned to the opposition research plan. Uber's dirt-diggers, Michael said, could expose Lacy. They could, in particular, prove a particular and very specific claim about her personal life.      Michael at no point suggested that Uber has actually hired opposition researchers, or that it plans to. He cast it as something that would make sense, that the company would be justified in doing.      In a statement through an Uber spokeswoman, Michael said: \\"The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner — borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for — do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach. They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.\\"      The spokeswoman, Nairi Hourdajian, said the company does not do \\"oppo research\\" of any sort on journalists, and has never considered doing it. She also said Uber does not consider Lacy's personal life fair game, or believe that she is responsible for women being sexually assaulted. (Lacy initially declined to comment on Michael's remarks; she denounced them in a column after this story was published.)      Hourdajian also said that Uber has clear policies against executives looking at journalists' travel logs, a rich source of personal information in Uber's posession.      \\"Any such activity would be clear violations of our privacy and data access policies,\\" Hourdajian said in an email. \\"Access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes. These policies apply to all employees. We regularly monitor and audit that access.\\"      In fact, the general manager of Uber NYC accessed the profile of a BuzzFeed News reporter, Johana Bhuiyan, to make points in the course of a discussion of Uber policies. At no point in the email exchanges did she give him permission to do so.      At the Waverly Inn dinner, it was suggested that a plan like the one Michael floated could become a problem for Uber.      Michael responded: \\"Nobody would know it was us.\\" ||||| We shared this in our News Ticker already, but I still can't believe that an office of Uber -- a company valued at 18 billion and held up as a bastion of modern entrepreneurship -- posted an ad that encouraged, played on, and celebrated treating women who may choose to drive cars to make extra money like hookers.      As a woman in this industry struggling mightily with growing sexism in tech demonstrated by people like Uber founder Travis Kalanick, it felt like a punch to the stomach. I didn't actually think Uber could shock me anymore. I was wrong.      I've spent weeks since my 6,000-word rant on Silicon Valley assholes having private conversations with the VCs who fund them. Almost none has argued with the premise of my story. But what some have argued is that those who are able to start great companies are a breed apart: misfits who we can't expect to conform to normal behavior. Kalanick's investors in particular (many of whom, incidentally, Pando shares) have told me that his same bad-boy behavior and arrogance is the only reason he was able to run headlong into the buzzsaw of dozens of powerful taxi lobbies.      I've never had much of an issue with Kalanick's hard charging competitive nature or libertarian beliefs. But this sexism and misogyny is something different and scary. Women drive Ubers and ride in them. I don't know how many more signals we need that the company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.      Maybe, as investors have argued, Kalanick himself has the balance of \\"acceptable\\" misogyny right. You know, he makes gross public comments about how his company should be called \\"Boober\\" because of all the tail he gets personally along with its success, but he wouldn't actually physically harm a woman himself. And maybe, the good of the company he builds -- and the many non-morally bankrupt people who I believe work there -- outweighs even his worst qualities.      Maybe.      Until today, I though that was a legitimate argument for why investors continue to support the company. You know, that and all the money it's printing hand over fist, leading to their outright terror of landing on his bad side.      But the rapidly pulled post out of Uber Lyon proves what every CEO has always known: It's less about what you say directly and explicitly to employees that creates or destroys a culture. It's what they take from what you say. And I am not surprised that someone inside the company took Kalanick's callous attitude towards female riders and comments like \\"Boober\\" to mean that shocking level of exploitation and disrespect was appropriate -- that it would even be celebrated by HQ.      And like always, Uber has quietly withdrawn the offending post, but they won't apologize. That only exacerbates the internal message that this type of behavior was only bad because it wound up on Buzzfeed.      Here's why this is particularly scary: Yes, Larry Ellison was said to be a womanizer, and that may or may not have created a hostile work environment for women at Oracle. If so, that would be a serious problem for employees, and one that needs to be stamped out by HR. But everyday users of Oracle's technology weren't going to find themselves alone in a dark car late at night with a randy relational database. Uber is a company that presents itself as a way for people to get home safely after a night of drinking. Uber passengers are often locked, alone, late at night in a metal box with Uber drivers. Because of the service Uber offers as a company, the CEO and its investors need to go out of their way to set the tone that objectification of women is simply not acceptable.      Here's what I told investors the last few weeks when we've had this debate: You can certainly invest based only on the place you expect to find maximum return. That's your job and your prerogative. But when it comes to the mounting misogyny in the tech world, you can't sit on stage at industry events and say you care deeply about the state of women in the startup world and silently support assholes like these. You simply can't have it both ways. And I'm going to be there to call it out, whether anyone listens or not. I'm particularly disappointed with Uber investors like Sherpa's Shervin Pishevar or Jason Calacanis who I know well, have supported Kalanick's antics, and have young daughters. They should care. They should be horrified.      So, I'm turning that advice on myself: I've finally deleted Uber from my phone. For one thing, I increasingly don't feel safe as a woman taking it, frequently late at night and alone. I've got a good solid alternative in Lyft, and life is too precious for me to put mine at risk.      And at some point, an asshole culture just goes too far. |||||","output":"Pando has been reporting on Uber's moral bankruptcy for years, from its early days of breaking laws to ignoring assaults on female passengers.

Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to relieve the company of financial losses. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, to help rally public support against human interference on the island. After learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on the island, Ian agrees to go to Isla Sorna, but only to retrieve her. Ian meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian. After arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter, Kelly, had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as an InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile, team leader Roland Tembo hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night, Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp. Nick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg.

That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet. One of you came to me, and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you. Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street, I agreed. And I put my bags down, picked up the ball and with eyes half shut, threw it as hard as I could. It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me. I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength. The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to blame you. Wouldn't it have been a better use of your time, and mine, if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then? I was clearly struggling. And yet you all just stood there, staring. Seeing that you weren't  going to get the ball yourselves, I become desperate. But I picked up the soccer ball for the third time. I forced a smile while crying inside as you patiently shouted words of support over the fence at me like I was a two-year-old holding a beech ball for the first time. \\"Throw it granny-style!\\" one of you said. \\"Just back up a little end throw it hard!\\" another offered And, most embarrassing of all, \\"You can do it!\\" I know you thought you were being encouraging, but it only served to deepen the embarrassment.

I hoped that I would have a heart attack and pass out, just so I'd be put out of my misery. Alas, the heart attack didn't happen.

They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.  Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.  He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776.  Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights.  With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work ?  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy...

Now, after this happened, you might expect some kids to become afraid or even angry at other kids who look like or come from the same place as the mean kids. This is what we call a 'backlash.' In one classroom (which is like America), there was a small backlash with a few kids acting mean towards others, but not too many. A boy from Bangladesh was picked on in New York and a girl was called a mean name in Boston.  However, most kids figured out that being mean to others based on where they come from or how they look is just not right - it's not fair to judge everyone by the actions of a few mean kids.

Butchers’ federation claims vegans want to ‘impose their lifestyle’ on the majority      Butchers in France have asked the government for police protection from animal rights activists, claiming their security was being threatened and that vegans were trying to impose a meat-free lifestyle on the nation.      The French federation of butchers wrote to the interior minister saying shops had been sprinkled with fake blood and covered in graffiti. It claims that a growing media focus on veganism was threatening butchers’ safety.      The letter said France’s 18,000 butchers were worried about the consequences of “excessive media hype around vegan lifestyles”, and that vegans wanted to “impose their lifestyle on the immense majority of people”.      “We count on your services and on the support of the entire government so that the physical, verbal and moral violence stops as soon as possible,” the federation wrote.      Seven butcher shops were vandalised and sprayed with fake blood in the Hauts-de-France region in the north of the country in April. Other incidents were reported in southern France.      A butcher and a fishmonger in the north had seen windows broken, with the slogan “Stop speciesism” left behind in spray-paint by the vandals.      It is not only purveyors of meat who have faced the wrath of the animal rights activists: last year a cheesemonger in Lyon said his shop was painted with the words “milk is rape” and “milk is murder”.      In March, a vegan cheesemaker was given a seven-month suspended jail sentence for condoning terrorism after she said on Facebook that she had no compassion for the supermarket butcher killed in a terrorist attack on a store in Trèbes and likened being a butcher to being a murderer.      “We condemn all violence,” said Sébastien Arsac of the non-violent L214 campaign group against animal exploitation, which has recently made high-profile films of practises in French abattoirs.      He told French media that while meat sales were going down, it was not the 5% of vegetarians in France that threatened butchers’ livelihoods but the 50% of people who were considering cutting down on meat.      Some have suggested butchers are seeking to generate publicity on the back of a small number of incidents.            Jean-François Guihard, a Brittany butcher and the head of the butchers’ federation, said he was not not asking for a police officer to be stationed outside each butcher shop but said the state must monitor what he called “extremist” vegan groups.            Asked by Le Parisien newspaper if he was against all vegetarians, Guihard said: “Not at all. If they refuse to eat meat, that’s their choice. We just want people to respect our craft and our customers, which means the majority of French people. Vegans are in a small minority.”      Faced with declining meat sales, farmers’ groups have effectively lobbied the centrist government of Emmanuel Macron in recent weeks to prevent “anti-meat” measures.      A proposal to require schools to provide a vegetarian meal at least once a week was dropped in parliament, while food producers have also battled to ban the use of the terms “steak”, “fillet”, “bacon” and “sausage” to refer non-meat products. ||||| PARIS — French butchers say they’ve had enough. Not only must they confront media coverage of the “vegan way of life,” now they say they are under assault.      After a series of small but unprecedented incidents, the butchers federation says its members need protection from militants who have broken windows, thrown fake blood and sprayed graffiti on their shops. In a letter to the French Interior Ministry, the butchers wrote that “physical, verbal, and moral violence” against them was “neither more nor less than a form of terrorism.”      The letter may be a touch hyperbolic — French vegan organizations are quick to defend their movement as nonviolent — but it has struck a chord with many French who dislike being told what they should eat.      Food is sacred in France, a country proud of its more than 300 cheeses and its cuts of beef so refined that it is impossible to order a steak at the butcher’s counter without being offered a choice of at least 10 cuts. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

News article: LONDON: The secret lives of some of the world's most revered spies — including the most notorious exotic dancer Mata Hari - Dutch spy who was executed for spying for the Germans, has now been revealed.            Britain on Thursday declassified the top secret files of spies during World War I held in the archives of the country's intelligence agency MI5.            More than 150 files are being made available in the digitized release as part of National Archives' campaign to mark the centenary of WW1 in 2014.            The documents include information on Arthur Ransome, author of the children's novel Swallows and Amazons and Sidney Reilly, a Russian-born adventurer whose exploits with the British Secret Service were the inspiration for James Bond.            The files contain a wealth of material about organisations such as the Bolshevik Party, British Communist Party and The Boy Scout Association and individuals like American poet Ezra Pound, political figures, from known fascists to communists and Russian leaders such as Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin, who were involved in espionage or under surveillance during the period of WW1.            The files include rare pictures, letters, post cards and interrogation reports.

Now that we have made the files available online, people across the globe can discover the secret history behind the war for themselves\\".            One of the most interesting releases is information on Mata Hari and the secrets in which she hey traded.            The dossier talks about how Dutch-born Hari tried for causing the deaths of 50,000 soldiers by spying for German intelligence was arrested in February 1917 in Paris before being executed in France aged 41.            Her file includes photos from publications and newspapers about her arrest, conviction and execution including letters and an interrogation report.            Among the documents is an inventory of Mata Hari's possessions when she was detained by Scotland Yard — a hat box with six hats, a feather boa, one veil, two fur necklets and an imitation peach.            A MI5 memo, referring to the spy by her real name of Margreet Zelle MacLeod talks about how the agency was alerted by their contact in Paris about the woman.            It says \\"He informs us that he has suspected her for some time and pretended to employ her in order, if possible, to obtain definite proof.\\"            MI5's informant in The Hague, codenamed \\"T\\" reported \\"Mata Hari is a demi-mondaine who is in relation with highly placed people and during her sojourn in France she made the acquaintance of many French and Belgian officers. She is suspected of having been to France on an important mission for the Germans\\".            Mata Hari was in November 1916 questioned by MI5 where she claimed that a French consul in Spain had subsequently asked her to go to Austria to spy on that country's forces.            A French intelligence report dating back to May 22, 1917, later shared with a MI5 officer in Paris noted \\"Mata Hari confessed that she has been engaged by Consul Cremer of Amsterdam for the German Secret Service. She was paid 20,000 francs in advance\\". She was shot by a French firing squad in 1917.            The documents also contain information about Edith Cavell — a British nurse, arrested, tried by German military court and executed. The documents contain photos of nurse Cavell's grave at the site of the execution in Belgium. The photos were sent by the French authorities to MI5 to pass on to her mother. There is a letter in response from Cavell's mother, thanking them for the photos.            The dossiers made public also talks about George Bacon — a German spy in the WW1. An American journalist recruited in New York, he was sentenced to death in 1917, later commuted to life imprisonment. Bacon was found in possession of materials for writing invisible messages; these were discovered after chemical tests were carried out on socks in his possession. The files include a letter to the home secretary from Bacon begging for a pardon from the British government. In it he states \\"The adventure for which I was punished was a foolish and theatrical one not done through hatred of Great Britain or her allies, but simply for excitement.\\"            He goes on to talk of his English ancestry and that Sir Frances Bacon is a relative of his. He also states that \\"there is no financial reason for asking for a pardon but the blood in my veins is English.\\" ||||| Image caption Details about the case of the Dutch female spy and entertainer Mata Hari are now available online      Interrogation reports and photographs are among secret MI5 files about World War One spies being made available online for the first time.

Mata Hari, once a wildly popular Dutch exotic dancer, didn’t appear fazed when an interrogator confronted her with a long list of her lovers, an MI5 report released earlier this month states.      Mata Hari was a wildly-popular Dutch exotic dancer, who was executed as a German spy in 1917. ( EI Scan ) Gertrude Zelle, known as Mata Hari, was executed by a French firing squad outside Paris in 1917. ( UPI )      “When faced with her acquaintances with officers of all ranks and all nations, she replied that she loved all officers, and would rather have as her lover a poor officer than a rich banker,” the MI5 files note. Walking the Western Front: • Where John McCrae wrote ‘In Flanders Fields’      Article Continued Below      • The ‘Trench of Death’ Her lovers included a wide range of ages and nationalities, including Germans, French, Russians, Swiss and Spaniards, the files state. At the time of her execution on Oct. 15, 1917, in a muddy field outside Paris, she was accused of feeding Germany information that cost some 50,000 Allied troops their lives. But two academics who have studied her case say they don’t believe she provided Germany with any useful information for its war effort. “She really did not pass on anything that you couldn’t find in the local newspapers in Spain,” said Julie Wheelwright of City University in London, the author of The Fatal Lover: Mata Hari and the Myth of Women in Espionage.      Mata Hari was the stage name for Gertruda Margaretha Zelle, who was born July 8, 1876, in the Dutch East Indies to a Dutch father and a Javanese mother. Wheelwright said she became an exotic dancer after fleeing an abusive marriage. Wheelwright described her as “an independent woman, a divorcee, a citizen of a neutral country, a courtesan and a dancer, which made her a perfect scapegoat for the French, who were then losing the war.”      Article Continued Below      “She was kind of held up as an example of what might happen if your morals were too loose,” Wheelwright said. Wesley Wark, a security, intelligence and terrorism expert at the University of Ottawa, said Mata Hari provided France with a scapegoat when the country wrestled with emerging power for women and fears of losing the war. “They needed a scapegoat and she was a notable target for scapegoating,” Wark said. In the MI5 files, an intelligence officer sounds impressed with her attitude during her final days. “She never made a full confession nor can I find … that she ever gave away anyone as her (accomplice) , ” the report states. “She was a ‘femme forte’ and she worked alone,” the report concludes. The newly released files show Mata Hari was trailed by Allied surveillance officers across France, Spain and England. The officers noted that on Aug. 4, 1916, she wrote to a Don Diego de Leon and then met a Capt. Vladimir de Masloff, of the Russian army, stationed in France. “He was very intimate with her from this date and constant letters pass between, he was her favourite lover,” the MI5 files state. “Same day she met PROFESSOR MARIANI Captain Italian Army.” While in custody in the ancient Prison de Saint-Lazare outside Paris, she admitted to having spied for the Germans, the MI5 files state. A file dated May 22, 1917 states: “Matahari today confessed that she has been engaged in Consul CREMER of Amsterdam for the German Secret Service. She was paid 20,000 (francs) in advance and her number was H.21.” That file also notes her German spymasters gave her vials of invisible ink. Much of her prison interrogation statement concerns mundane thoughts, not troop movements. Her MI5 file includes the note: “She had discussed the life led by people in Paris, as regards supply of food etc., had said that the English officers in Paris treated their French Allies badly, although the French went out of their way to treat them ‘like Kings’; that the French nation might live to regret that they had ever allowed the English into the country … .” Even if she wanted to divulge information, there wasn’t much she could say, Wark said. “Politics wasn’t really part of her world.” Accounts of her execution say she waved off the offer of a blindfold or the last sacrament. She was reportedly blowing a kiss — at her lawyer, a nun or the firing squad, depending on who’s telling the story — the instant her life ended. Wheelwright thinks this was likely bravado on the dancer’s part. “This was going to be her last performance and she was going to go out in style,” she said. “She was playing to the crowd, which is what she always did.” ||||| First World War 100      We have marked the centenary of the war with an extensive programme, spanning a four-year period between 2014 and 2018.

This decision has attracted significant attention from football enthusiasts in Guinea and the broader international football community, as the West African nation strives to elevate its performance on the continental and global stage. In this article, we will explore the factors leading to the implementation of the normalisation committee, the challenges faced by the Guinea national team, and the credentials of the shortlisted candidates. The Need for Normalisation The Guinea Football Federation has faced a series of hurdles in recent years, with governance issues and financial mismanagement plaguing the sports administration. These setbacks have adversely impacted the national team's performance, leading FIFA to intervene and establish a normalisation committee in September 2020. The core objective of this committee has been to oversee Guinea's football affairs, review its statutes, and organise elections for a new executive committee. This restructuring process has put a spotlight on the role of the national team coach, with the normalisation committee recognising the importance of a strong and visionary leader to guide the players towards success. Consequently, the committee has meticulously assembled a shortlist of five eminent football professionals, each possessing the technical know-how and experience needed to revitalise the country's football fortunes. The Shortlisted Candidates 1. Didier Six: A former French international with 52 caps, Six has an impressive playing record, including a prominent role in France's triumph in the 1984 European Championships. Since then, he has held coaching positions with several national teams, such as Mauritius, Togo, and more recently, Madagascar. Six's experience coaching national teams within Africa, along with his European background, brings a unique mix of expertise to the table. 2. François Zahoui: Having represented Ivory Coast in his playing career, Zahoui transitioned into coaching and claimed the reins of his native national team. Notably, he guided the Elephants to the final of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, which demonstrated his ability to work with elite African talents. Zahoui's experience managing top-tier African football and his knowledge of local football culture could prove invaluable for Guinea. 3. Lappé Bangoura: A familiar face for Guinea's football fans, Bangoura has coached the national team previously. His tenure included leading the team to the quarterfinals of the 2016 African Nations Championship and a positive showing at the 2017 WAFU Cup of Nations in Ghana. Bangoura's intimate understanding of Guinea's football landscape and his experience with the national team afford him a competitive edge over the other candidates. 4. Kaba Diawara: An ex-international striker for Guinea, Diawara brings a wealth of playing knowledge to the table. Following his retirement from professional football, he gained his UEFA coaching badges and embarked on a mentoring career, focusing on youth development. Diawara's close connections with the local football community, coupled with his insight as a former national team player, could be advantageous should he secure the top job. 5. Raoul Savoy: A Swiss tactician, known for his work at various African clubs and national teams such as Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and Gambia, Savoy is celebrated for his strong organisational skills and adaptability. His understanding of diverse football cultures and languages within Africa, and his proven track record in implementing effective strategies for different teams, make him a strong contender for the role. Conclusion As the Guinea Football Federation entrusts its normalisation committee with the task of selecting the new national team coach, the shortlisted candidates each bring unique qualities and experiences that could be instrumental in restoring the nation's footballing prowess. The forthcoming decision will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the Guinea national team, as fans and stakeholders anticipate the beginning of a new chapter in their football journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"You have, Mr. President - for this I am very grateful - on behalf of this house, rejected those who believe that terrorism can be combated exclusively with the language of violence. In this statement, the speaker expresses their gratitude towards the President for resisting the notion that terrorism can be dealt with solely through violent means. It acknowledges that the President has stood up against this belief and, by extension, signaled the importance of exploring different approaches to counteract terrorism. By doing so, the President has shown resilience and a willingness to look for alternative strategies, which the speaker appreciates. The idea of combating terrorism with more than just violence is crucial in modern times, as terrorist networks continue to evolve and adapt to new tactics. A multifaceted approach that involves diplomatic, political, economic and social initiatives, alongside security measures, is necessary to address the root causes of terrorism. By engaging in constructive dialogue, fostering peaceful societies, addressing grievances, and promoting human rights and social justice, these efforts contribute to a more long-lasting and sustainable solution. For example, improving education, economic opportunities, and social inclusiveness may help deter individuals from joining extremist groups, which often prey on vulnerable populations. Additionally, promoting cultural understanding and reducing prejudice can help bridge the gaps between communities, allowing them to work together in addressing the issues that fuel terrorism. Furthermore, a collaborative approach to intelligence sharing and law enforcement coordination among countries helps in detecting and preventing terrorist activities more effectively. Plus, addressing the financing channels of terrorist networks and strengthening international legal frameworks against terrorism are significant aspects to consider. In conclusion, the speaker's appreciation for the President's stance against employing only violence to counter terrorism highlights the significance of embracing a comprehensive and collaborative strategy. It underscores that sustainable peace can be achieved through a combination of preventive, protective, and transformative measures that address the complex challenges posed by terrorism."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that Barbara is the daughter of? from the following article ?  On a train trip, lawyer Richard Grant tells fellow passengers that, based on his long experience both prosecuting and defending murder cases, murder is sometimes justified and a clever man should be able to commit it undetected. He is traveling to the isolated estate of his wealthy client and friend, Gordon Rich; his young adult daughter Barbara surprises him at the train station, where she informs him that she has already been there a week. Grant's view is soon put to the test. Rich asks him to rewrite his will, including bequests to all his former mistresses (except one who is dead already; she was just 16, and Grant believes it was suicide). When Rich explains that he wants a new will because he intends to marry Barbara, Grant is appalled. He repeats what he said on the train. Rich deserves to be murdered, and if that is what it takes to stop the marriage, Grant will do it and get away with it. Rich retorts that if necessary he will retaliate from beyond the grave. Grant pleads with his daughter, pointing out the great age difference and Rich's indecent character. But she loves Rich and is adamant. Nor has Tommy Osgood, a young man Barbara had been seeing, been able to change her mind. At a dinner party that night, Rich announces the wedding and says it will take place in the morning. His longtime girlfriend, Marjorie West, is dismayed, but after the party he assures her that, as usual, he will return to her once he exhausts his obsession with Barbara. He is only marrying Barbara because she would not go to bed with him otherwise.

Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package naman14.timber. The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Impressive Music App with Minor Issues Review: I recently started using the naman14.timber music app, and I have to say, I'm quite impressed with its overall performance and user interface. Here's my step-by-step experience and justification for giving it a 4-star rating: 1. After installing the app, I immediately appreciated the clean and modern design. It is intuitively laid out, allowing me to easily access my music library and playlists. The app also incorporates a visually appealing color scheme. 2. The core functionality of the app, which is playing music, is excellent. The sound quality is high, and I experienced no issues with playback, skipping, or pausing. I also enjoyed the built-in equalizer, which allowed me to customize the listening experience to my preference. 3. The app's music organization features are another strong point. It automatically sorted my music library into categories based on artist, album, and genre, making it easy for me to quickly navigate and find the specific tracks I wanted to listen to. 4. However, I encountered minor synchronization issues when using the app to transfer and manage my music across multiple devices. This led to occasional duplicate entries or missing album artwork, which was frustrating but not a deal-breaker. 5. While the app has a solid selection of customizable themes, I found that some of them negatively affected the legibility of the text, making it difficult to read song titles and artist names. I would appreciate if the developers refined these themes for better readability. 6. Finally, I experienced occasional app crashes and freezes, although this happened infrequently enough not to be severely disruptive. However, I hope that the developers address these stability issues in future updates. In conclusion, the naman14.timber app is a stylish and highly functional music app with just a few minor drawbacks. I believe that, with further refinement, this app has the potential to become a top-tier music player. I give it a well-deserved 4-star rating and look forward to seeing how it continues to evolve and improve."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland. But another aircraft was heading toward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing: United 93. United Airlines Flight 93 FAA Awareness.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine. The immortal Charles Dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine. I admit I have not seen the classic Alistair Sim version and I'm sure someday I will but I would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version. I believe that if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it. The story is well known, I won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another. A rich, stingy, mean, old man is visited by the Ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways. In order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits, each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with, past, present and future. Finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done. George C. Scott is absolutely, undeniably perfect for this role. He takes hold of the Ebeneezer Scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character. He is not just a mean old man, but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world. There is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved. Scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge. Not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place. This is a grand epic of Victorian England, Dickens England is recreated before our very eyes, the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market. Director Clive Donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination. I could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery. It's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real. The film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between. The rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life. Bob Cratchitt, played by David Warner and his entire family including and especially the young Tiny Tim played by Anthony Walters were wonderful. The Ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story. A Christmas Carol is not a light story. Dickens wrote this story for a dark period in England's life and it's one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark, almost scary, and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around. The dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures Christmas miracles. The score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the Christmas music, everything fits together. Apparently Christmas movies are my favorite because I insist everyone see this Christmas Carol above all others. 10/10 Options are:  (A). negative.

Choose from: -no. -yes. The answer is:","output":"-no. The two questions are not the same. They are different in terms of subject, focus, and intention. Here is a detailed analysis of each question: 1) \\"Why Indian politicians don't have Facebook posts like 'enjoying movie with friends' or 'enjoying Valentine's Day'?\\" This question is seeking an explanation for why Indian politicians tend not to post casual updates about their personal lives on social media platforms such as Facebook. It implies that, unlike ordinary citizens, politicians may be more guarded about sharing, or are less likely to partake in activities such as watching a movie with friends or celebrating Valentine's Day. There could be multiple reasons for this, including: a) Concern for privacy: Politicians may prefer to keep their private lives separate from their public personas, avoiding potential controversies or distractions from their political agendas. b) Professional image: Politicians are often expected to maintain a certain level of decorum and professionalism, and posting casual, personal updates might not align with that image. c) Security reasons: Due to their high-profile status, politicians may face security risks that could be escalated by publicly sharing their locations or activities. d) Cultural norms: Indian society can sometimes hold conservative views, and the idea of an Indian politician celebrating Valentine's Day or engaging in casual social outings might be deemed inappropriate. 2) \\"Any NGO to help abandoned old people in Pune, India?\\" This question is entirely unrelated to the first one, as it is asking for information about non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that provide assistance to elderly individuals who have been abandoned or require support in Pune, India.

To answer this question, one could provide a list of NGOs in Pune that focus on elder care, including organizations such as: a) HelpAge India: A national NGO that specifically focuses on addressing the needs of elderly people through various initiatives such as advocacy, healthcare services, and income generation programs. b) Janaseva Foundation: A Pune-based NGO that runs multiple projects to aid elderly individuals, including an old age home and healthcare support. c) Ishaprema Niketan: An organization in Pune that assists abandoned or destitute older adults by providing shelter, healthcare, and rehabilitation services. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same, as they focus on distinct subjects and seek different types of information. The first question relates to the personal social media usage of Indian politicians, while the second addresses the availability of NGO assistance for elderly individuals in Pune, India."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

In the first sentence, \\"The Russian villain is, however, an interesting and sometimes original threat,\\" the phrase \\"however\\" is used to potentially contrast or contradict a previous statement. This sentence emphasizes that the Russian villain is both interesting and can be original at times. In the second sentence, \\"However, the Russian villain is an original and sometimes interesting danger,\\" the emphasis is on the Russian villain being original first and interesting only at times. Additionally, the word \\"threat\\" is replaced with \\"danger\\" in the second sentence, which can be interpreted similarly but may convey a subtly different connotation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Thomas Lawton was born on 6 October 1919 to Elizabeth Riley and Thomas Lawton senior in Farnworth, Lancashire. His father was a railway signalman of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh \\"Jim\\" Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father. Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the age of 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \\"keen and fearless\\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3-1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935-36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games.  Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06.  He turned professional at Burnley at the age of 17 on wages of PS7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a PS500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was there anything else interesting in the article?","output":"Yes, there is something interesting in the article. It says, \\"Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh.\\" This shows that Lawton was not only good at football but also talented in cricket."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer? , can you please find it?   In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Scientists say ice loss could cause water levels around the world to rise faster than expected. Ice is melting faster than expected because of global warming. Researchers in Antarctica are studying many other subjects too. Some use the cold weather and clear air as a way to study things that affect other parts of the globe. Antarctica has the cleanest air in the world. That allows scientists to compare the air there to the air in polluted places. Antarctica is the darkest place on earth, so it is a great place to study the stars. Some scientists are even studying penguin droppings . They have developed a new test to learn more about penguins' diets.","output":"Which of the following statements about Sir Edmund Hillary is NOT true?

Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction   concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the...

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Although ticks are found outdoors, indoor infestations of the brown dog tick are not uncommon. This kind of tick feeds on dogs and other animals and prefers warm, dry conditions. The first step in removing these ticks is to de-clutter your home, because ticks hide almost anywhere. Pick up items from the floor, and don't leave dirty laundry lying around. Your tick infestation is an opportunity to do a little spring-cleaning. Ticks attach to dirty clothing or bed linens. Wash clothes or linens you suspect may be tick-infected in the hottest water suitable for the fabric type. Avoid leaving dirty laundry on the floor, and if you suspect any clothes or linens might have ticks, do not put them in the laundry hamper, because this will contaminate the other clothes. Put them straight into the washing machine. The next step is to clean your entire home thoroughly from top to bottom. Clean out shelves, dust forgotten corners and sweep, mop, and vacuum all floors.  Your vacuum cleaner will be your best friend during the tick-removal process, because you can suck up ticks from all over the house; in animal bedding, in cracks in the floor and wall, on baseboards and crown molding, and on and underneath furniture. Be sure to dispose of the vacuum bag afterwards. Once your house is cleaned and decluttered, and you have physically removed as many ticks as possible, you will need to use pesticides to kill any remaining ticks and their eggs.  To kill tick eggs and larva, you need to lightly dust all areas of your home with a pesticide contain boric acid and botanical extracts. Sprinkle a little extra dust around your pet's bedding, which is a favorite laying spot. To kill the adults, use a pyrethrin-based pesticide spray designed especially for getting rid of brown dog ticks. This is safe for humans and pets and works quickly. Spray this pesticide all over the home. Don't forget carpets and curtains, and the underside of tables, chairs and sofas. Make sure to read the label for exact directions. Read the directions on the pesticide to see if people and animals have to leave the area for a certain amount of time after the pesticide is used. Indoor pets, usually dogs, are the number one source of tick infestations. Dogs can carry ticks in from outdoors, or catch them from other animals in the kennel or the local neighborhood.  First you need to physically remove any ticks that are using your animal as a host, then treat the dog with a topical tick-killing product containing ingredients such as fipronil, amitraz or permethrin. Ask your veterinarian for suggestions. You may also invest in a tick-repelling collar for your pet. These will keep ticks from latching onto your cat or dog for approximately three months. These collars can be difficult to find in stores, so ask your vet, or shop online. Severe tick infestations may require a professional exterminator. They have specialized equipment and pesticides, which kill ticks immediately on contact. They also have an in depth knowledge of ticks' habitats and behaviors, so they will be able to locate the ticks very quickly. If your tick infestation remains a problem, despite your best efforts to get rid of them, you may want to consider this option.

Rinse with dishwater from the sink. 3. Shake out any dirt that sticks. Analysis: Both options start with tearing the stalk off the base, which is the correct way to separate the individual celery stalks. However, the rinsing methods differ in each option. In option A, the celery is rinsed under running water which helps to remove dirt and other debris. In option B, the celery is rinsed with dishwater from the sink.

The Lightning connector allows for faster data transfer and charging, but has led to the frustration of some customers who need to purchase adapters or new cables for compatibility with older devices and accessories. The push for a universal phone charger is not a new idea, as the European Union has been advocating for a single charger standard for years, with a goal of reducing electronic waste and making it more convenient for consumers. In 2011, major phone manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung, and Nokia, signed a voluntary agreement to implement a universal charging solution based on microUSB connectors, but it did not include tablets and other devices. If the European Union passes the legislation requiring a standardized phone charger, it is anticipated that Apple will need to make significant adjustments to its products in order to comply. This could potentially involve redesigning its devices to include a microUSB connector or developing an adapter to convert the Lightning connector to microUSB. It is also possible that the European Union could adopt a newer standard, such as USB-C, which is increasingly being used in other devices and has similar capabilities as Apple's Lightning connector. Overall, the most logical completion of this news story would be: Apple could face a challenging transition if the European Union enforces the creation of a universal phone charger. This will likely require the tech giant to make significant changes to its products, either by redesigning their connectors or developing a compatible adapter, in order to comply with the new law. As tech companies and the European Union work together to establish a single charging standard for mobile devices, consumers can expect greater convenience and reduced electronic waste in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Some of the games in which the young men competed were: running, jumping, and wrestling. Women were not allowed to take part in the games. After about the year 393 AD the Olympic Games stopped. For centuries there were no Olympic Games. But they were not forgotten.  The first Olympic Games in modern times happened in 1896.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How was Lithuania effected by the Crusades?\\" is in \\"With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The question asks about the impact of the Crusades on Lithuania. The Crusades, beginning in 1095, were a series of religious wars initiated by European Christians with the aim of reclaiming the Holy Land from Islamic rule. Among the various consequences of these conflicts, one significant aspect was the migrations and changes in the European Jewish population. As a result of the Crusades and the expulsions of Jews from England in 1290, France in 1394, and parts of Germany in the 15th century, Jewish migration moved eastward towards countries such as Poland in the 10th century, Lithuania in the 10th century, and Russia in the 12th century. These migrations played a crucial role in shaping the economic, social, and cultural landscape of these regions, particularly in the case of Lithuania. There are several reasons why Jews became increasingly involved in trade, business management, and financial services during this period. One factor was that Christian Europeans often imposed restrictions on certain activities by Jews. These restrictions prevented Jews from participating in some financial activities, such as charging interest on loans to Christians. This limitation actually led to Jewish individuals being in high demand for financial services, as Christians were not allowed to engage in what was considered \\"usurious\\" practices. Another important factor contributing to the prominent role of Jews in trade and finance was the high rate of literacy and near-universal male education within Jewish communities. This intellectual background granted Jewish people the knowledge and skills required for successful involvement in cross-cultural business activities. Moreover, Jewish merchants had the advantage of a widespread diaspora, which allowed them to rely on and trust family members living in various regions and countries. These trusted connections facilitated smoother cross-border trade and access to unique information and resources. In conclusion, the Crusades had a significant impact on Lithuania, particularly through the migration of Jewish populations into the region. The subsequent involvement of Jewish communities in trade, business management, and financial services led to the development of a dynamic economic landscape within Lithuania. This was fueled by factors such as Christian prohibitions on certain activities, high rates of literacy and education within Jewish communities, and the ability of merchants to rely on their extended families and networks for support in international business ventures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Why does Dumbledore put up with Professor Umbridge's interference? Albus Dumbledore puts up with Dolores Umbridge's interference for several reasons. Firstly, he recognizes the importance of maintaining a stable environment within Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and any clash between himself and Umbridge would likely lead to considerable disruption. As a wise and experienced leader, Dumbledore is fully aware that his resistance against Umbridge could come at a cost to the learning experience of his students. By seemingly acquiescing to her authority, he ensures that the student body remains as unified as possible and continues to develop both academically and morally. Secondly, Dumbledore is aware that Umbridge's appointment is a direct result of the Ministry of Magic's interference in Hogwarts. Given the delicate political context at the time, Dumbledore understands that any attempts to remove Umbridge from her position would not only be futile but could also further damage the already strained relationship between the Ministry and the magical community at large. Dumbledore's decision to tolerate Umbridge is, therefore, a strategic one, designed to preserve the integrity of the school and its faculty. Lastly, Dumbledore believes in the value of resilience and adaptability. By allowing the students and faculty to experience the challenges posed by Umbridge's presence, he creates an opportunity for them to grow and learn from adversity. Through their dealings with Umbridge, students and staff are given the chance to cultivate qualities such as patience, critical thinking, and resistance against authoritarian regimes, all of which will serve them well in later life. Question 2: What was Dumbledore's first wand made up of? Before acquiring the Elder Wand, which was made of elder wood and contained a Thestral tail hair core, Dumbledore's first wand was made up of unknown materials. Details about his first wand, such as the type of wood or core, have never been revealed by J.K. Rowling. However, it is known that Dumbledore was an incredibly skilled and powerful wizard, so it can be assumed that his first wand was well-suited to his magical abilities. Comparison of Questions 1 and 2: No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 inquires about Dumbledore's motives for enduring Professor Umbridge's interference at Hogwarts. This query focuses on examining the complex sociopolitical context and maintaining peace within the school environment. In contrast, question 2 seeks information about the composition and origins of Dumbledore's first wand. This question pertains to the magical abilities and possessions of one of the wizarding world's most influential figures. Thus, the topics under discussion in each question are inherently distinct, with the first revolving around interpersonal dynamics and the second exploring the physical elements of magic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Journalists Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi wrote bombshell books detailing the uphill battle Pope Francis is facing in reforming the Vatican. Their books, released last week, were based on leaked documents from a reform commission Francis named to get a handle on the Vatican’s finances and propose reforms. On Wednesday, Vatican spokesman the Rev.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop British-based jihadists carrying out Paris-style gun attacks, a former security minister has said. Lord West said the UK’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition. The Labour peer also hit out at the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding. Scroll down for video. Former security minister Admiral Lord West said new powers were needed to tackle Islamist fanatics. Lord West's intervention comes amid warnings from security chiefs that up to 150 jihadists in the UK could carry out gun attacks similar to the Paris atrocities, the Sunday Times reported this morning. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning Lord West said the government’s Communications Data Bill, dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents, was needed to track terrorist suspects. The bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online. Lord West said: ‘I think that needs to go through, and I was very irked that it was removed, in fact it was removed by the Deputy Prime Minister, when it had all been agreed across all parties.’ He added that the security services ‘need more money’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in Syria intent on carrying out attacks at home. The Labour peer’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that Britain was being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Lord West (left) was interviewed by the BBC presenter Andrew Marr (centre) alongside the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was open minded about giving the security services more powers to monitor people's emails. Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Warning: Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need. Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'","output":"A former security minister, Lord West, said that tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop British-based jihadists from carrying out attacks like the ones in Paris. He mentioned that the UK's strong anti-gun laws were an important part in preventing terrorism, but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The Man behind Blue Jeans     Levi Strauss was born in 1829 in Bavaria,Germany. He was the fifth of six children. His father sold dry goods from door to door. (Dry goods include many different things; fabric , thread,scissors,combs,buttons,yarn,etc.)     In 1845, his father died. All six children decided to go to the United States. Two of Strauss' bothers started a dry goods company in New York City. Strauss' sister Fanny and her husband started a similar business in San Francisco. Strauss decided to go to the southeastern part of the United States. For eight years, he walked along the country roads selling dry goods from door to door - just like his father in Bavaria.     In 1853, Strauss decided to move to San Francisco.(At that time, thousands of people traveled to California to look for gold.)On the way to California, Strauss sold almost all of his dry goods. He had only one thing left-- some  _ .     In California, Strauss tried to sell the canvas to the gold miners . He said they could make tents from the canvas. But they weren't interested in canvas for tents. Strauss didn't know what to do with the canvas. Then, he had an idea. Strauss could see that the miners needed new pants. There were holes in their pants because the fabric wasn't strong. He decided to make the canvas into pants. They called them \\" _ \\". Later, Strauss stopped using canvas and used a different fabric. It was a heavy cotton fabric-- the same kind people wear today.     Levi Strauss died in 1902. He never married and left his money to his nephews. He left the world much more -- the jeans that so many people wear. Question: What is canvas? Answer: A:","output":"Canvas is a durable, heavy-duty fabric that is typically made from cotton or a blend of cotton and other materials. It is commonly used for making tents, sails, bags, and other items that require strength and sturdiness. In the context of the article, Levi Strauss initially used canvas to make pants for gold miners due to its durability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What counties was the CEW in?  The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built \\"hutments\\" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive. The answer is:","output":"The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was primarily located in two counties in East Tennessee: Roane County and Anderson County.

Reuters/Jonathan Ernst      The white supremacist website Stormfront.org is struggling to get back online.      Its founder, former Ku Klux Klan chief Don Black, has complained that the website is down after the domain registrar Network Solutions yanked the domain and that he's also unable to transfer the domain to another provider.      The website has been offline since Friday.      Via his radio show on Monday, Black said Network Solutions had \\"taken it upon themselves to censor anybody they want.\\" He added: \\"Late Friday, without any notice, they didn't even send me an email — they decided that Stormfront was politically incorrect and therefore they could close it down.      \\"Not only did they close the domain name — I can't even transfer it. I can't even try to transfer it to another registrar because they can do whatever they want.\\"      Black added that he was trying to get his lawyers to \\"go after these idiots.\\" And while he has numerous other domains registered with other providers, he specifically wants to bring Stormfront.org back online.      The Knoxville News Sentinel first reported on Friday that Network Solutions had suspended the Stormfront.org domain.      Network Solutions hasn't commented on its actions, and its parent firm Web.com has not responded to a request for comment.      The domain suspension may be linked to pressure from the civil-rights group Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which wrote to Web.com earlier this month to accuse Stormfront of violating the company's \\"acceptable user policy\\" — specifically because of the site's \\"racist\\" content and \\"bigotry.\\" Black attributed Stormfront's shutdown to the group.      A domain search on Stormfront.org shows that the domain is \\"on hold,\\" a status normally assigned to sites that are involved in legal disputes or nonpayment or that are about to be deleted.      Stormfront is a forum-style site first registered online, according to Black, in January 1995. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Stormfront was the first major white supremacist website, and its members have been disproportionately responsible for mass killings. Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people, posted on the site.      Stormfront's suspension follows a wider US crackdown on hate websites. Multiple domain hosts pulled support for another neo-Nazi site, The Daily Stormer, while payment and fundraising firms including Apple and GoFundMe have refused to support white supremacist websites. ||||| Stormfront, the oldest neo-Nazi forum on the web, has been shut down by its name provider, Network Solutions, and the domain officially put on hold. The news followed the shutdown of DailyStormer, another supremacist site.      Stormfront began in 1990s as a dial-up BBS and then morphed into a website and forum in about 1995. It has been registered at Network Solutions since 1995.      The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Executive Director Kristen Clarke said that her organization took “action against Stormfront.”      “Their website is a vehicle used to promote racially-motivated violence and hate,” she wrote. The group told Network Solutions that Stormfront was violating their terms of service.      Stormfront was unique in that it was considered the “murder capital of the Internet” by the Southern Poverty Law Center and, as of 2014, over 100 murders were attributed to Stormfront users. The SPL wrote that the site was popular with “wound collectors.”      “A typical murderer drawn to the racist forum Stormfront.org is a frustrated, unemployed, white adult male living with his mother or an estranged spouse or girlfriend,” wrote the SPL in 2014. “She is the sole provider in the household. Forensic psychologists call him a ‘wound collector.’ Instead of building his resume, seeking employment or further education, he projects his grievances on society and searches the Internet for an excuse or an explanation unrelated to his behavior or the choices he has made in life.”      The group also has a Cloudflare account according to the DNS records. Cloudflare’s CEO has spoken out against hate groups and was instrumental in beginning the attack against DailyStormer.

Don’t drink beverages containing ice or local water. Drink beverages after you open their original, sealed containers. Article:","output":"Title: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water: Tips for Travelers and Outdoor Enthusiasts Introduction Access to clean drinking water is a basic necessity, but it can also be an additional challenge for travelers and outdoor enthusiasts. Untreated water sources could harbor harmful pathogens posing risks to your health. Thankfully, there are steps you can take to ensure you have access to clean and safe drinking water. This article offers practical advice on how to treat and consume water appropriately when you are away from a reliable source. Boiling Untreated Water One of the most effective ways to ensure water safety is boiling. When you are unsure about the quality of a water source, it is recommended to boil the water for at least one minute. Boiling water eliminates various types of harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites that may be present, ensuring that it is safe for consumption. If you are at an elevation of over 6,500 feet (2,000 meters), it is advisable to increase the boiling time to three minutes to compensate for the decreased air pressure. Using Iodine Tablets or Filters Alternatively, you can also treat local water with chemical disinfectants such as iodine tablets or use filters specifically designed for removing contaminants. Iodine tablets effectively kill most types of bacteria and viruses, but they may not be effective against certain parasites like Cryptosporidium. To use iodine tablets, follow the manufacturer's instructions and allow the appropriate wait time before consumption.  On the other hand, filters can physically remove harmful particulates and microbes from the water. To ensure the maximum effectiveness of a filter, choose a high-quality one that is proven to eliminate pathogens. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's directions on usage and maintenance for optimal performance. Avoid Drinking Beverages Containing Ice or Local Water When traveling in areas with questionable water quality, always refrain from consuming beverages containing ice or local water. Unknown water sources could be contaminated, and just because the water is frozen doesn't mean it's safe. Stick to drinking bottled water or treated water you've brought with you to lower the risk of waterborne illnesses. Opening and Consuming Beverages from Original, Sealed Containers It is essential to consume beverages only after you open their original, sealed containers to avoid potential contamination. Unsealed bottles could have been tampered with or exposed to harmful substances. Make sure to purchase beverages from reputable vendors, check for intact seals, and prioritize single-use containers. Conclusion Maintaining safe drinking practices while traveling or engaging in outdoor activities is crucial in reducing the risk of waterborne diseases. By boiling untreated water, using iodine tablets or filters, avoiding beverages containing ice or local water, and consuming only originally sealed beverages, you can minimize potential health risks and focus on enjoying your experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Previously known as \\"THE-QS World University Rankings\\", the publisher had collaborated with \\"Times Higher Education magazine\\" (\\"THE\\") to publish its international league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own versions. QS then chose to still use the pre-existing methodology while \\"THE\\" adopted a new one. The QS system now comprises the global overall and subject rankings, alongside five independent regional tables (Asia, Latin America, Emerging Europe and Central Asia, the Arab Region, and BRICS). It is the only international ranking to have received International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) approval, and is viewed as one of the most widely read of its kind, along with \\"Academic Ranking of World Universities\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\". However, allocating undue weight to subjective indicators and having highly fluctuating results are its major criticisms.  - Cornelius Cardew (7 May 193613 December 1981) was an English experimental music composer, and founder (with Howard Skempton and Michael Parsons) of the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental performing ensemble. He later rejected experimental music, explaining why he had \\"discontinued composing in an avantgarde idiom\\" in his own programme notes to his Piano Album 1973 in favour of a politically motivated \\"people's liberation music\\".  - Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) has been Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand since 6 February 1952. She is Head of the Commonwealth and Queen of 12 countries that have become independent since her accession: Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.  - Howard While Skempton (born 31 October 1947) is an English composer, pianist, and accordionist.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - The New Zealand Order of Merit is an order of chivalry in New Zealand's honours system. It was established by royal warrant on 30 May 1996 by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, \\"for those persons who in any field of endeavour, have rendered meritorious service to the Crown and nation or who have become distinguished by their eminence, talents, contributions or other merits\\", to recognise outstanding service to the Crown and people of New Zealand in a civil or military capacity.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Scratch Orchestra was an experimental musical ensemble founded in the spring of 1969 by Cornelius Cardew, Michael Parsons and Howard Skempton.  - Philip Dadson is a New Zealand musician and artist , who was in the foundation group for the Scratch Orchestra and founder of From Scratch . He was made an Arts Laureate by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand in 2001 , and an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2005 . He lectured at the Elam School of Fine Arts , part of the University of Auckland from 1977 , leaving in 2001 to take up full - time art practice . He co-authored the 2007 book Slap Tubes and other Plosive Aerophones with fellow instrument inventor Bart Hopkin , whose 1998 CD / book Gravikords , Whirlies & Pyrophones had also featured Dadson 's group From Scratch .  - The Elam School of Fine Arts, founded by John Edward Elam, is part of The University of Auckland. Students study degrees in fine art with an emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach. The school is located across three buildings, the Mondrian building, Building 431 (or the \\"Main\\" fine arts building), and Elam B, which includes the studios for postgraduate and doctoral students on Princes Street, in central Auckland, New Zealand.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - The University of Auckland is the largest university in New Zealand, located in the country's largest city, Auckland. It is the highest-ranked university in the country, being ranked 81st worldwide in the 2016/17 QS World University Rankings. Established in 1883 as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand, the university is made up of eight faculties over six campuses. It has a head count of more than 40,000 students, and more than 30,000 equivalent full-time students.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - In European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics or beauty, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function, such as pottery or most metalwork.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.

Plot title: The Odd Couple II Movie plot: It has been 17 years since Oscar Madison and Felix Ungar have seen one another. Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscarâthe woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah. On the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his waysâhe is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separationâat least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike. They end up in a rural area, where the car rolls off a cliff and catches fire. If that were not enough, they get arrested several times by the local police, first for catching a ride in a truck carrying illegal Mexican immigrants. At a bar in town, they meet two extroverted women, Thelma and Holly, and buy them drinks. Accepting an offer of a ride from a stranger even older than themselves, Felix and Oscar end up inside a 150,000 vintage Rolls Royce Silver Wraith with a dead body and get arrested a second time. Irritated, exhausted and convinced that they'll never get to the wedding, they get arrested yet again for consorting with armed Rednecks who believe Oscar and Felix were flirting with their wild women, Thelma and Holly. The boys are freed and driven directly to the local airport by the police, who are only too pleased to be rid of them. A woman boarding the airplane is also en route to... My question: To whom Oscar is telling about the wedding? Answer:","output":"The plot synopsis provided does not explicitly state to whom Oscar is telling about the wedding. However, it is mentioned that Brucey, Oscar's son, is the one who informs Oscar about the wedding. But there is no clear indication that Oscar is recounting the wedding or its details to any particular person in the events outlined in the synopsis. The rest of the plot focuses mainly on the mishaps and adventures of Oscar and Felix as they try to reach the wedding venue. So the question about to whom Oscar is narrating about the wedding is not answerable based on the provided movie details."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the names of the five models Saint-Saëns forged his own style from?  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... A:","output":"The five models that Saint-Saëns forged his own style from are: 1. Meyerbeer: Saint-Saëns was influenced by the effective use of chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer. This allowed him to create a more dynamic and engaging operatic experience for the audience. 2. Tudor music: For his opera Henry VIII, Saint-Saëns researched and incorporated Tudor music that he discovered in London. This helped him authentically represent the era in which the opera was set and added a unique historical element to his composition. 3. Oriental pentatonic scale: In La princesse jaune, Saint-Saëns used an oriental pentatonic scale, adding an exotic and distinct flavor to the music. This allowed him to explore different musical styles and create a work that stood out from standard European operatic compositions. 4. Wagner: Saint-Saëns derived the use of leitmotifs from Richard Wagner, although he used them more sparingly than the German composer did. Leitmotifs are short recurring musical phrases that represent a character or an idea in an opera. This technique helped Saint-Saëns add depth and coherence to his compositions. 5. Conventional opera structure: Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet in terms of through composition (a continuous musical structure without clear divisions between arias and ensembles). He favored discrete arias and ensembles, which provided a more traditional operatic feel to his works."},{"instruction":"Jordan was retiring this week.

As a result, the person's ability to inhale and exhale effectively may be compromised, leading to less oxygen reaching the lungs. In addition, reduced physical fitness can also lead to weaker diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which can further hinder the expansion of the lungs. This often results in shallower breathing and decreased oxygen absorption within the alveoli. Ultimately, this means that less oxygen will be available for the body's tissues and organs, which can adversely affect overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Clearly, clothes those street dancers wear show their personalities   and clothing styles. Now let us take a look at street dancers' clothing styles.

For men, they often wear a large T-shirt with probably a jacket at times. However, for women, they often wear tank tops (T) . Bottoms Today, the street dancers still prefer wearing large jeans and a lot of men also wear Capri pants  . However, women start to wear mini skirts or shorts. Nowadays knee-high socks are also a popular new look for the women. Footwear For any street dancer, shoes are important.

Movie plot title: Courage Under Fire Movie plot: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train. Serling tracks down Ilario using details about Ilario's preferred vacation spot. Ilario tells the true story, revealing that Monfriez wanted to flee while leaving Rady behind.

Brian Wayne Transeau (born October 4, 1971), better known by his stage name BT, is an American music producer, composer, technologist, audio technician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter. An artist in the electronica music genre, he is credited as a pioneer of the trance and intelligent dance music styles that paved the way for EDM, and for \\"stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point.\\" He also creates music within many other styles, such as classical, film composition and bass music. BT is also known for pioneering the stutter edit. In the early years of BT's career, he became a pioneering artist in the trance genre, this despite the fact that he doesn't consider himself a DJ, since he infrequently spins records and comes from an eclectic music background. He was creating trance music before it was known by that name. When he started out, such common elements as a build, breakdown and drop were unclassified. BT's was a unique interpretation of what electronic music could be. His first trance recordings, \\"A Moment of Truth\\" and \\"Relativity\\", became hits in dance clubs in the UK. His productions were not yet popular in the US, and he was initially unaware that he had become popular across the Atlantic, where UK DJs like Sasha were regularly spinning his music for crowds. Sasha bought BT a ticket to London, where BT witnessed his own success in the clubs, with several thousand clubbers responding dramatically when Sasha played BT's song. He also met Paul Oakenfold, playing him tracks that would make up his first album. He was quickly signed to Oakenfold's record label, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.  BT's 1995 debut album Ima, released on Oakenfold's label, was a progressive house effort. The opening track, \\"Nocturnal Transmission\\", was featured in The Fast and the Furious. The album also featured a song with Vincent Covello. Blending house beats with sweeping New Age sounds, Ima helped to create the trance sound. \\"Ima (Jin )\\" is the Japanese word for \\"now\\". BT has stated that it also means many other things and that the intention of the album is to have a different effect for everyone.  Following the release of Ima, BT began traveling to England regularly. It was during this time that he met Tori Amos. They would collaborate on his song \\"Blue Skies\\", which reached the number one spot on Billboard magazine's Dance Club Songs chart in January 1997. This track helped expand BT's notability beyond Europe, into North America. He soon began to produce songs for well-known artists such as Sting, Madonna, Seal, Sarah McLachlan, NSYNC, Britney Spears, Diana Ross and Mike Oldfield.","output":"This text is about Brian Wayne Transeau, better known by his stage name BT, an American music producer, composer, technologist, audio technician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate  , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. \\"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \\"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes  , they care about schools and the community.\\" Many believe that the civic   education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote. Students usually just do community services like cleaning the neighborhoods. This means they haven't learned how to link real life problems to politics through voting, according to Christopher Beem, a politics professor at the Pennsylvania State University.

This baby penguin clearly wasn't camera shy as he posed for a picture before hungrily snapping his beak around the cameraman's legs. The tiny King Penguin was among a gang of chirpy chicks which surrounded wildlife photographer Jon Cornforth as he set up his equipment. The young birds were part of a huge colony based in Salisbury Plain, on South Georgia Island, in the south Atlantic Ocean. A baby King Penguin looks down the lens as photographer Jon Cornforth captures this image. Picture perfect: The baby penguin flaps his little wings in front of the camera. Mr Cornforth, from Seattle, in the US, had to quickly hot foot it out as the hungry penguins went for his legs, while he set up a GoPro camera on the edge of the colony. He said: 'It was pretty comical to be able to go back and look through that footage. 'There were hundreds of thousands of penguins in that area.

That said, we can all drop the pretense of breaking new ground and enjoy this fantastically executed collection of lush tech-house tracks. There is a certain amount of Basic Channel/Chain Reaction influence on these various tracks, and none of them has very much personality of its own, but as an album they interact fairly well and make both a rewarding listen on the dancefloor and on headphones.

The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.  Paragraph: Humans have just discovered the ability to asexually reproduce if they wish. Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis.

Question: Information:  - Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830. It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of HanoverGeorge I, George II, George III, and George IVwho reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture. In America the term \\"Georgian\\" is generally used to describe all building from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are \\"architectural in intention\\", and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range.  Characteristics. The style of Georgian buildings is very variable, but marked by a taste for symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome, as revived in Renaissance architecture. Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically rather restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before, replacing English vernacular architecture (or becoming the new vernacular style) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - Calligraphy is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument, brush, among other writing instruments. A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as, \\"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner\\".  - The London Borough of Harrow is a London borough of north-west London, England. It borders Hertfordshire to the north and other London boroughs: Hillingdon to the west, Ealing to the south, Brent to the south-east and Barnet to the east. The local authority is Harrow London Borough Council.  - Vellum (derived from the Latin word \\"vitulinum\\" meaning \\"made from calf\\", leading to Old French \\"vélin\\", \\"calfskin\\") often refers to a parchment made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals. It is prepared for writing or printing on, to produce single pages, scrolls, codices or books. The term is sometimes used with a more general meaning referring to finer-quality parchments made from a variety of animal skins.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - A charity school, sometimes called a blue coat school, was significant in the history of education in England. It was erected and maintained in various parishes by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants for teaching poor children to read, write, and other necessary parts of education. It was usually maintained by religious organizations, which provided clothing and education to students freely or at little charge. In most charity schools, children were likewise put out to trades, services, etc., on the same charitable foundation. Some schools were more ambitious than this and sent a few pupils on to university, as depicted in the illustration.  - The Public Schools Act 1868 was enacted by the British Parliament to reform and regulate seven of the leading English boys' schools of the time, most of which had grown out of ancient charity schools for the education of a certain number of poor scholars, but were then, as they do today, also educating many sons of the English upper and upper-middle classes on a fee-paying basis.  - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.  - Harrow is a large suburban town in the London Borough of Harrow, northwest London, England. It is centred northwest of Charing Cross. Harrow-on-the-Hill includes the conservation area with a high proportion of listed buildings with a residential and institutional array of Georgian architecture and a few 17th century examples.

They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly?

Energy production: A high metabolic rate also ensures that dolphins have enough energy to perform their daily activities and physical functions. They require this energy for swimming, diving, hunting for prey, social interactions, and to evade predators. The metabolic processes break down the nutrients consumed by the dolphin, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, and convert them into usable energy. 3. Oxygen consumption and lung efficiency: The fact that all mammals breathe air applies to dolphins as well, despite their aquatic lifestyle. They have lungs for gaseous exchange and breathe through a blowhole located on the top of their head. With a high metabolism, dolphins require a sufficient supply of oxygen for their cells and organs to function effectively. An increase in the metabolic rate leads to an increased demand for oxygen, which makes dolphins highly efficient at extracting oxygen from the air they breathe and maximizing the time they can spend underwater between breaths. 4. Growth and development: A high metabolic rate in dolphins supports their growth and development from infancy to adulthood. The energy generated ensures that they can maintain normal physiological processes, develop strong muscles and skeletal structure, and successfully reproduce to maintain their species' population. 5. Adaptation to environment: Dolphins' high metabolic rate has enabled them to adapt well to their aquatic environment. The heat generated by their metabolism not only helps them maintain a stable internal body temperature but also provides them with the energy to swim fast, dive deep, and cover long distances in search of food and mates. These abilities have made dolphins highly adaptable and successful in various oceanic habitats around the world. In conclusion, a dolphin maintaining a high metabolism rate is crucial to its survival, growth, and success in its aquatic environment. This high metabolic rate allows it to maintain its body temperature, produce sufficient energy for daily activities, enhance oxygen consumption and lung efficiency, support growth and development, and adapt to the diversity of oceanic habitats it inhabits."},{"instruction":"Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What group was tasked with making nuclear weapons in April of 1939, and was sabotaged by the Allied Nations in World War II?

In one corner: pop superstar Lady Gaga and her nearly 40 million followers. In the other: pop culture blogger Perez Hilton and his 6.1 million Twitter fans. Who won the war of 140 characters? It depends on whom you ask. The feud between the former friends appears to stem from several incidents: Hilton tweeted Thursday that Katy Perry's new single, \\"Roar,\\" is better than Gaga's latest song, \\"Applause.\\" On Friday, Gaga, who is in the midst of a comeback following a serious tear to her right hip, cryptically referenced a text from Hilton that appeared to make light of her injury. \\"Still have the text Perez sent me of me in a wheelchair with the words KARMA written across + Madonna pointing a gun at me,\\" she tweeted.

Baron Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola (Italian: ['e:vola]; 19 May 1898 - 11 June 1974), better known as Julius Evola (), was an Italian philosopher, painter, and esotericist. According to the scholar Franco Ferraresi, \\"Evola's thought can be considered one of the most radical and consistent anti-egalitarian, anti-liberal, anti-democratic, and anti-popular systems in the twentieth century. It is a singular (though not necessarily original) blend of several schools and traditions, including German idealism, Eastern doctrines, traditionalism, and the all-embracing Weltanschauung of the interwar conservative revolutionary movement with which Evola had a deep personal involvement\\". Evola's dissent from standard biological concepts of race had roots in his aristocratic elitism, since Nazi Volkisch ideology inadequately separated aristocracy from \\"commoners.\\" According to Furlong, Evola developed \\"the law of the regression of castes\\" in Revolt Against the Modern World and other writings on racism from the 1930s and World War II period. In Evola's view \\"power and civilization have progressed from one to another of the four castes--sacred leaders, warrior nobility, bourgeoisie (economy, 'merchants') and slaves\\". Furlong explains: \\"for Evola, the core of racial superiority lay in the spiritual qualities of the higher castes, which expressed themselves in physical as well as in cultural features, but were not determined by them. The law of the regression of castes places racism at the core of Evola's philosophy, since he sees an increasing predominance of lower races as directly expressed through modern mass democracies.\\"  Prior to the end of War, Evola had frequently used the term \\"Aryan\\" to mean the nobility, who in his view were imbued with traditional spirituality. Wolff notes that Evola seems to have stopped writing about race in 1945, but adds that the intellectual themes of Evola's writings were otherwise unchanged. Evola continued to write about elitism and his contempt for the weak. His \\"doctrine of the Aryan-Roman 'super-race was simply restated as a doctrine of the 'leaders of men'...no longer with reference to the SS, but to the mediaeval Teutonic knights of the Knights Templar, already mentioned in Rivolta.\\"  Evola spoke of \\"inferior non-European races\\". Peter Merkl wrote that \\"Evola was never prepared to discount the value of blood altogether\\". Evola wrote: \\"a certain balanced consciousness and dignity of race can be considered healthy\\" in a time where \\"the exaltation of the negro and all the rest, anticolonialist psychosis and integrationist fanatiscm [are] all parallel phenomena in the decline of Europe and the West.\\" While not totally against race-mixing, in 1957, Evola wrote an article attributing the perceived acceleration of American decadence to the influence of \\"negroes\\" and the opposition to segregation. Furlong noted that this article is \\"among the most extreme in phraseology of any he wrote, and exhibits a degree of intolerance that leaves no doubt as to his deep prejudice against black people.\\"","output":"This text is about Baron Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola, better known as Julius Evola. He was an Italian philosopher, painter, and esotericist who lived from 1898 to 1974. Evola's thoughts were anti-egalitarian, anti-liberal, anti-democratic, and anti-popular. He was influenced by German idealism, Eastern doctrines, traditionalism, and the conservative revolutionary movement. Evola had unique views on race, believing in the importance of spiritual qualities in higher castes and criticizing modern mass democracies.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Prince William enjoyed an emotional reunion with his wife after flying back into the UK this morning following six weeks in the Falklands. The Duchess of Cambridge drove herself to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to meet her husband as soon as he touched down at around 4am. It is understood the reunited couple headed for their London home in the grounds of Kensington Palace, afterwards. Sea King pilot William, 29, has been on deployment in the South Atlantic with his RAF Search and Rescue crew. Back in Britain: Prince William, pictured here studying maps during his deployment in the Falklands, has returned to the UK, it was revealed today. Mission: Prince William prepares for his first sortie with crew members at the Mount Pleasant Complex on the Falkland Islands at the start of his tour of duty last month. His routine posting proved. controversial in the run up to the 30th anniversary of the Falkland. Islands conflict, with the Argentinian Government accusing the UK of. using the prince’s presence to inflame tension between the two. countries. The second in line to the throne’s. posting is the longest that the couple, who married last April after. seven years as a couple, have been apart. William will now take a brief period of leave with his wife before resuming his duties at RAF Valley on Anglesey, North Wales. A source added: ‘The Duchess met the prince on arrival Brize Norton. She wouldn’t have missed it for the world.’ While her husband was away, Kate marked her first Valentine's Day as a married woman by visiting a children's hospital. But despite not being able to see William, the Prince was still able to send a bouquet of flowers from 8,000 miles away. The Duchess of Cambridge admitted she was missing her husband 'terribly' while he was away. Prime Minister David Cameron and Argentine President Cristina Kirchner have traded barbs in the lead-up to the 30th anniversary of the invasion of the Falklands on April 2. Argentinean fury: Demonstrators march past a Harrods store in Buenos Aires as they protest against the arrival of Prince William in the Falklands. Argentina has accused the UK of. 'militarising' the dispute by reportedly sending a submarine carrying. nuclear weapons to the South Atlantic, something that Britain has not. confirmed. Buenos Aires also objected to the. Duke's posting to the Falklands and the deployment to the region of one. of the Royal Navy's most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless. In turn, Britain insists its. movements of troops and warships are purely routine, and claims. Argentina is trying to impose an 'economic blockade' on the Falklands by. restricting shipping to and from the islands. Over the coming days the Duke, 29, is. expected to spend time with his wife and other members of the Royal. family before he returns to Wales. Flight Lieutenant Wales was part of a four-man team on call for search and rescue missions in the Falklands. Islanders say William briefly visited. the local hospital, and made a trip to remote Sea Lion island, a. paradise for penguins, sea lions, elephant seals. The Prince was first deployed on February 1. Speech: The Duchess of Cambridge visits Treehouse, part of the East Anglia's Children's Hospices where she delivered a speech to the organisation on Monday before Prince William returned to Britain today. While William was away, the Duchess of Cambridge performed her first public engagement without her husband at her side. She attended a private viewing of a. new exhibition of portraits by the late Lucian Freud at the National. Portrait Gallery in London, of which she recently became royal patron. And on Monday she gave her first. public address - speaking at The Treehouse children's hospice in. Ipswich, Suffolk, wearing a £139 dress her mother borrowed to wear to Ascot in 2010. A spokeswoman for Clarence House confirmed that the Duke of Cambridge was back in Britain. She said: 'Prince William arrived. back in Britain this morning at the end of his deployment in the. Falkland Islands as part of a four-man search and rescue crew. 'He is now going to be on a brief period of leave before resuming his duties at RAF Valley in Anglesey.' While William is away: The Duchess of Cambridge reads a card given to her on Valentines Day by a 12-year-old girl in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool as Prince William is deployed in Argentina. Highlights:","output":"1. Prince William came back to the UK after six weeks in the Falklands. 2. His wife, Duchess of Cambridge, met him at RAF Brize Norton. 3. His time at Falklands was a bit controversial between the UK and Argentina governments. 4. Prince William will take time off with his wife before going back to work. 5.

Article: The 4-year-old boy was mentally disabled, unable to speak in complete sentences and unable to play with other children because of his violent fits  of hitting and biting. The decision facing one Brooklyn jury was how much a landlord should pay in damages to the boy -- named \\"G.M.M.\\" in court documents -- after an investigation showed he had been living in an apartment illegally coated with lead paint. Attorneys  representing G.M.M. said 3.4 million was the right number, arguing that the boy would have had a bright career ahead of him; both of his parents had graduated from college and his mother received a master's degree. But the landlord's defense put the figure at less than half that -- 1.5 million. Attorney Roger Archibald noted that because the boy was Hispanic, G.M.M. was unlikely to attain the advanced education that would provide to such a large income. The 4-year-old's case is a rare public look at one corner of the American legal system that explicitly uses race and gender to determine how much victims or their families should receive in compensation  when they are seriously injured or killed. As a result, white and male victims often receive larger awards than people of color and women in similar cases. These differences largely derive from _ of how much more money individuals would have earned over their lifetimes had they not been injured -- projections that take into account average earnings and employment levels by race and gender.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jens Ingemar Johansson (Swedish: ['ING:emar 2ju:hans,son]; 22 September 1932 - 30 January 2009) was a Swedish professional boxer who competed from 1952 to 1963. He held the world heavyweight title from 1959 to 1960, and was the fifth heavyweight champion born outside the United States. Johansson won the title by defeating Floyd Patterson via third-round stoppage, after flooring him seven times in that round. For this achievement, Johansson was awarded the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year--the only non-American to do so in the belt's entire 27-year existence--and was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. Johansson's introduction to the top rank of the sport was inauspicious. At age nineteen he was disqualified for passivity at the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympics in the heavyweight competition in a fight against eventual Olympic gold medalist Ed Sanders. Johansson maintained he was not evading Sanders (who also got a warning for passivity), but rather was trying to tire his opponent. Johansson said he had been limited to a 10-day training camp, had only trained with newcomers, and had been told by his coach to let Sanders be the aggressor. Nevertheless, his silver medal was withheld for poor performance and only presented to him in 1982.  Johansson had earned his spot in the Olympics by winning the Swedish National Championship earlier the same year, 1952, after he knocked out his opponent in the first round of the final.  After the Olympics Johansson went into seclusion for six months and considered quitting boxing. However, he returned to the ring and turned professional under the guidance of the Swedish publisher and boxing promoter Edwin Ahlquist, subsequently winning his first 21 professional fights. He won the Scandinavian pro title by knocking down and outscoring the Dane Erik Jensen (breaking his right hand in the process). A broken hand and a one-year military service kept him out of the ring until late 1954. In August 1955, in his twelfth professional fight, Johansson knocked out former European Heavyweight Champion Hein ten Hoff in the first round. He took the Scandinavian heavyweight title in 1953 and, on 30 September 1956, he won the European Heavyweight Championship by scoring a 13th-round KO over Italy's Franco Cavicchi in Milan for the European title.  Johansson successfully defended his European Crown against ranked heavyweights Henry Cooper (fifth-round KO on 19 May 1957) and Joe Erskine, with a TKO in 13 on 21 February 1958. How did he get started in boxing?","output":"Ingemar Johansson started boxing when he was 19 years old. He first became known in the sport when he participated in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He earned his spot in the Olympics by winning the Swedish National Championship earlier the same year, after knocking out his opponent in the first round of the final. After the Olympics, he briefly thought about quitting boxing, but decided to continue and went on to become a professional boxer with the help of Swedish publisher and boxing promoter Edwin Ahlquist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment  is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

Question: -  Prophase is the first and longest stage of mitosis - In this stage the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In prophase the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In metaphase the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fiber at their centromere - In anaphase the sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart - During telophase the chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process following telophase is cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division, during which the cytoplasm of the parent cell gets divided between the two newly formed daughter cells. This stage is essential for completing the cell division process and ensuring the creation of two genetically identical cells. During cytokinesis, the cell's cytoplasm divides, and distinct cellular components, such as organelles, are distributed between the two daughter cells. In animal cells, this process is facilitated by the formation of a cleavage furrow, which is a contractile ring made up of actin and myosin filaments. The cleavage furrow tightens around the cell's equator, gradually pinching the parent cell into two separate cells. In plant cells, cytokinesis occurs through the formation of a cell plate, which is a structure that assembles at the cell's equator and consists of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles fuse together, providing the materials for the construction of a new cell wall and plasma membrane, effectively separating the two daughter cells. Upon completion of cytokinesis, the cell cycle starts anew for each daughter cell, which will then either continue to grow and divide or enter a resting state until the appropriate signals are received for further division. In this way, cytokinesis ensures the proper distribution of genetic material and cellular components and plays a critical role in growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sigmoid colon volvulus, also known as sigmoid volvulus, is a common cause of bowel obstruction and constipation. It is common in Asia, India (7% of intestinal obstruction) and especially South India because of the high fibre diet. It is very common cause of large bowel obstruction in Peru and Bolivia due to high altitude. Can we draw the following conclusion? Sigmoid colon volvulus can be caused by a high fibre diet.","output":"Sigmoid colon volvulus (or sigmoid volvulus) is indeed a common cause of bowel obstruction and constipation, and its prevalence varies significantly among different regions, cultures and diets. However, drawing a direct causative link between a high fiber diet and sigmoid volvulus might not be entirely accurate based on the information provided. The sigmoid colon is the last part of the large intestine before the rectum. A volvulus is a condition where this part of the colon becomes twisted or rotated on itself, creating a bowel obstruction that can lead to severe complications if not treated. Variations in diet, particularly in regard to fiber intake, are among many factors that can influence bowel motility and potential for such conditions to occur. However, other factors including anatomical variations, bowel length, age, chronic constipation, and different regional habits can all contribute as well. While it is true that the condition is common in certain regions like Asia and South India – where diets are generally high in fiber – this correlation does not necessarily imply causation. High fiber diets, in fact, are typically recommended for promoting healthy bowel functions since dietary fiber aids in softening stools and promoting regular bowel movements. Constipation, which is typically caused by a low-fiber diet, is actually a risk factor for sigmoid volvulus as it can lead to prolonged transit time and the accumulation of feces, which can cause the sigmoid colon to distend and twist. Hence, the higher prevalence of sigmoid volvulus in these regions could be related to other regional differences such as aspects of the local cuisine and eating habits, genetics, lifestyle factors, or a combination of these and possibly other factors. For example, it’s worth noting that high altitude, as in the case of Peru and Bolivia, can influence the function and physiology of the gut as hypoxic conditions (low oxygen) can cause slowing down of gut motility and potentially lead to bowel obstruction. In conclusion, while dietary fiber can affect bowel movements and affect the conditions in the colon, it might not be accurate to state that a high fiber diet directly causes sigmoid colon volvulus. The exact causes of sigmoid volvulus are multifactorial and can involve a range of elements including age, chronic constipation, anatomical abnormalities and certain genetic conditions. As with many health matters, it's a complex interplay of various factors and more research is definitely needed to elucidate the precise role of specific dietary factors in triggering this condition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What position in the market does the brand Grolsch occupy? Context: The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. More than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of 294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006. The history of breweries has been one of absorbing smaller breweries in order to ensure economy of scale. In 2002 South African Breweries bought the North American Miller Brewing Company to found SABMiller, becoming the second largest brewery, after North American Anheuser-Bush. In 2004 the Belgian Interbrew was the third largest brewery by volume and the Brazilian AmBev was the fifth largest. They merged into InBev, becoming the largest brewery. In 2007, SABMiller surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch in 2007. In 2008, InBev (the second-largest) bought Anheuser-Busch (the third largest), the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company became again the largest brewer in the world.

Staple the card along the edge: once at each end and once in the middle.  You can use printer paper, binder paper, or sketchbook paper. If you want a nicer finish, use cardstock or thin cardboard for the back of the notebook instead of the back of the card. For a nicer finish, wrap patterned washi tape over the top edge of the notebook to hide the staples. Cut the covers off of 4 vertically-oriented cards. Use an awl or a mini hole punch to poke a series of holes along each of the long edges. Thread a yarn needle with yarn or twine, then sew the long edges together with a blanket or whipstitch to make a block. Use the luminary with LED candles.  Use cards that are from the same event or holiday. Don't mix and match cards, such as birthday and Christmas. Make sure that the cards are all the same size and height, otherwise, the luminary will turn out crooked. Take cards from an event, such as a wedding, and cut the covers off. Glue the cards together to create a rectangle or square. Use a craft blade to cut a hole from the middle a little smaller than a photograph. Choose a photo from the event, then glue it to the back of the frame, so that it shows through the hole. Overlap the cards to create a collaged effect. Choose a ceramic or cork tile, then trace it onto a card. Cut your tracing out, then glue it to the front of the tile with waterproof decoupage glue. Seal the top and edges of the card with more decoupage glue. Let the glue dry, then add a second coat.  If you are using a ceramic tile, glue felt or cork dots to the back so you don't scratch your table. Some glues need to cure for several days. Read the label on the bottle for complete drying instructions. You can use this technique to decoupage the cards onto other items, such as boxes or notebooks. Summary:","output":"This article provides various creative ways to repurpose and transform greeting cards into unique items such as puzzles, notebooks, luminaries, photo frames, and coasters. 1. Puzzle: Cut a card with a full image into puzzle shapes and try to put them back together. Keep the pieces in an envelope or candy tin for easy storage. 2. Notebook: Cut a card in half and use it as front and back covers for a notebook. Sandwich 25 sheets of paper between the covers and staple along the edge. For a nicer finish, use cardstock for the back cover, and cover the staples with patterned washi tape. 3. Luminary: Cut the covers off four cards from the same event or holiday, ensuring they are the same size. Poke a series of holes along the edges, and sew them together using yarn or twine to make a block. Use LED candles to illuminate the luminary. 4. Photo frame: Take cards from an event and glue them together to create a rectangle or square shape. Cut a hole in the center for a photograph and glue the photo to the back, so it shows through the hole. Overlap the cards for a collaged effect. 5. Coaster: Trace a ceramic or cork tile onto a card, cut it out, and glue it to the tile with waterproof decoupage glue. Seal the top and edges with more glue, allowing it to dry before adding a second coat. Attach felt or cork dots to the back to prevent scratches on surfaces. This technique can also be used to decorate other items, such as boxes or notebooks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Dracula Movie plot: In May 1885, Jonathan Harker arrives at the castle of Count Dracula near Klausenburg (Cluj), to take up his post as librarian. Inside, he is startled by a young woman who claims she is a prisoner and begs for his help. Dracula then appears to greet Harker and guide him to his room, where he locks him in. Jonathan starts to write in his diary, and his true intentions are revealed: he is a vampire hunter and has come to kill Dracula.     John Van Eyssen as Jonathan Harker. Freed sometime later, Harker again is confronted by the desperate woman. She begs him for help but then bites his neck. Just as she does, Dracula â fangs bared and lips bloody â arrives and pulls her away. When he awakens in daylight, Harker finds the bite mark. He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old. Whilst he does this, the sun sets, and when he turns to Dracula's coffin with the intention of killing the vampire, he finds it empty. Looking up, Harker is in time to see the Count shut the door and they are both plunged into darkness... A few days have passed Dr. Van Helsing then arrives in Klausenburg, looking for Harker. An inn keeper's daughter gives him Harker's journal. When he arrives at the castle, it is deserted; a hearse carriage speeds by with a coffin in it. In the crypt, Van Helsing is horrified to discover Harker lying in a coffin as a vampire. Staking Harker, he leaves to deliver the veiled news of Harker's death in person to a wary Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina, brother and sister-in-law of Harker's fiancÃ©e Lucy Holmwood. Lucy is ill, so the news is kept from her and Lucy's little niece, Tania.

Review: (possible spoilers) Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us. The film was given a 123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are undermined somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much better use of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday \`Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger (hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation). The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensively hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising campaign. The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). She seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character. Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious 123 million stink bomb grossed 260 million domestically or they'd not be here today.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher .  - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\".  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\".  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.    What is the relationship between 'international pentecostal holiness church' and 'christianity'? Answer:","output":"The International Pentecostal Holiness Church (IPHC) is a denomination within Christianity. Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, and it is the world's largest religion with over 2.4 billion followers. The IPHC, founded in 1911, is a Pentecostal Christian denomination that has its roots in the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century. Both the IPHC and the broader Christian community believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity. Thus, the relationship between the International Pentecostal Holiness Church and Christianity is that the IPHC is a subset of the larger Christian faith, sharing core beliefs while having its unique practices and doctrines within the Pentecostal tradition."},{"instruction":"I heard that Throughout the years Bailey never found her real mom, even through investigation.

A revised sentence could read: \\"Given that ghosting involves abruptly ceasing communication with a former partner without any explanation, it is often considered to be a rude and inconsiderate behavior.\\" This revised sentence clarifies that ghosting is viewed negatively, emphasizing the lack of communication and consideration for the other person's feelings. It also shows a clear connection to the preceding text by discussing how ghosting is perceived by others.  Ghosting can result from a variety of reasons, including the desire to avoid confrontation or emotional discomfort, a lack of emotional maturity, or even as a form of manipulation.

It leaves the person on the receiving end confused, frustrated, and potentially heartbroken, as they're left without closure or understanding of what went wrong. It is important to note that not only is ghosting considered rude, but it can also have lasting effects on the mental and emotional well-being of the person who was ghosted. They may experience feelings of rejection, self-doubt, and anxiety regarding future relationships. Some people may even develop trust issues because of this type of sudden and unexplained abandonment. In conclusion, the act of ghosting is often seen as a discourteous and thoughtless behavior in the context of intimate relationships due to its lack of communication and consideration for the other party.

An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.

The band consists of George Pettit (unclean vocals), Dallas Green (clean vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Wade MacNeil (lead guitar, vocals), Chris Steele (bass guitar), and Jordan Hastings (drums, percussion). They describe their music as \\"the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight\\" (a reference to their song \\"A Dagger Through the Heart of St. Angeles\\", also the inspiration for their debut album cover art). Alexisonfire had attracted considerable attention from major record labels, due to the success of their self-titled debut. However, when they started considering making a second album, the band felt that, for artistic reasons, they should remain independent, as it would give them better chances of developing and deciding their direction. They would remain with Distort Entertainment, and instead of using a famous producer, they recorded the album with Julius Butty at his studio near Hamilton, Ontario.  Watch Out! was released on June 29, 2004, and was immediately successful. It debuted at No. 6 on the Nielsen Soundscan Top 200, and received gold certification in Canada in twelve weeks. The good critical reception came from the fact that the band was more focused from the eighteen months of touring, helping them harness more aggression, release more emotion, and fine-tune all the tracks. This lay in comparison to their debut album, which was mostly first drafts.  On June 14, 2005 Alexisonfire posted a statement on their website revealing that founding drummer Jesse Ingelevics was leaving the band. The statement explained that the band and Ingelevics had slowly grown apart, and that he wanted to spend more time with his family and his fiancee.  While touring in support of the album with Johnny Truant and The Blood Roses in Glasgow, Scotland in October 2005, each member of all three bands had the word \\"Yeti\\" tattooed on themselves. On an episode of the MuchMusic program The New Music, Pettit and Green revealed that the inspiration for their \\"Yeti\\" tattoos came from the 1988 Gary Oldman film The Firm.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did anything else happen during this time?","output":"During this time, there were changes in the band members as their drummer Jesse Ingelevics left the band.

If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.

They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.

The more patient you are, the more accepting you will be of what life is, rather than insisting that life be exactly as you would like it to be. Without patience, life is extremely frustrating. You are easily annoyed, bothered, and irritated. Patience adds a dimension of ease and acceptance to your life. It's essential for inner peace. Becoming more patient involves opening your heart to the present moment, even if you don't like it. If you are stuck in a traffic jam, late for an appointment, being patient would mean keeping yourself from building a mental snowball before your thinking get out of hand and gently reminding yourself to relax. It might also be a good time to breathe as well as an opportunity to remind yourself that, in the bigger scheme of things, being late is \\"small stuff\\". Patience is a quality of heart that can be greatly enhanced with deliberate practice. An effective way that I have found to deepen my own patience is to create actual practice periods--periods of time that I set up in my mind to practice the art of patience. Life itself becomes a classroom, and the curriculum is patience. You can start with as little as five minutes and build up your capacity for patience over time. What you'll discover is truly amazing. Your intention to be patient, especially if you know it's only for a short while, immediately strengthens your capacity for patience. Patience is one of those special qualities where success feeds on itself. Once you reach little milestone --five minutes of successful patience--you'll begin to see that you do indeed have the capacity to be patient, even for longer periods of time. Over time, you may even become a patient person.  Being patient will help you to keep your perspective. You'll see even a difficult situation, say your present challenge, isn't \\"life or death\\" but simply a minor obstacle that must be dealt with. Without patience, the same scenario can become a...

I do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of Braveheart. It is simply more realistic and has more believable characters. Ridb Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy to look like, messy hair and beard with simple clothing. Also the Liam Nesson has a Celtic look about him, he looks like a Scot and more importantly looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter. The story contains a little romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. Sound anything like Braveheart? But instead of a film that cries out \\"freedom\\", liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting film. Much like Gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour. The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic.

A new emergency alert system that sends notifications to cell phones in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack will be implemented in New York and Washington by the end of this year, officials said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday unveiled PLAN, the Personal Localized Alerting Network, which is expected to provide residents with timely information \\"alerting them to imminent safety threats in their area.\\" Mobile phone users will receive \\"geographically targeted, text-like messages,\\" according to a written statement from the Federal Communications Commission. \\"Every weekday our population of 8.4 million residents swells to more than 12 million as commuters and tourists come to town,\\" Bloomberg told reporters. \\"Under the PLAN program, we'll be able to broadcast (emergency) messages to any of them who are within our target area.\\" Mobile customers will receive three types of alerts containing 90 characters or less, ranging from presidential alerts to child abduction bulletins. Phone carriers may allow subscribers to block all but presidential alerts, officials said. A special chip is needed to allow phones to receive the notifications, though many \\"smart\\" phones already have the new technology, said FCC spokesman Neil Grace. \\"We're a mobile society,\\" said Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator. \\"How many of us are sitting there listening to a radio or television when these (traditional) alerts come out?\\" \\"This system will send it to your phone.\\" It will also be able to send messages when cell phone towers experience network congestion, overriding other calls in an effort to deliver the notification. High mobile phone traffic and downed cell phone towers are considered primary reasons for service disruption in New York in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \\"There are many lessons to be learned from 9/11,\\" said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski. \\"One of them is that we were under-utilizing communications technologies in emergencies.\\" PLAN is expected to be expanded to the rest of the country by April 2012 and was made possible by a 2006 congressional bill called the Warning Alert and Response Network Act. \\"It would have been great if we had something like this available as recently as last month for the tornadoes in the south,\\" Genachowski added.

Please answer the following question: Question: He was hiking for miles, what did he suffer from? Options: - sweating - cramps - physical exertion - smile - deliriousness  Explain why a human would choose \\"cramps\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"cramps\\" as the answer to the question above because it is the most logical and relevant option among the given choices, considering the context of the question. While hiking for miles, the person is most likely to experience physical discomfort or issues related to their muscles and body. Cramps refer to the painful, involuntary muscle contractions that can occur due to various factors, such as overuse, fatigue, or dehydration, which are common during long hikes. When people engage in strenuous physical activity, such as hiking, their muscles require more energy and electrolytes to function properly. If the body becomes depleted of these essential components, it can result in cramps. Although the other options offered could still be related to the situation of hiking for miles, they are not as directly associated or relevant as cramps. Let's briefly analyze each of them: 1. Sweating: While sweating is common during physical activity, it doesn't necessarily lead to negative consequences or discomfort in the same way cramps do. Sweating is a natural bodily function that helps regulate body temperature. 2. Physical exertion: Although physical exertion is inherent in hiking, it isn't a negative consequence or something the hiker would primarily \\"suffer from.\\" Physical exertion is a general term for any physical activity that requires effort. 3. Smile: A smile is an expression of happiness and contentment, not something someone suffers from. It isn't directly related to the physical consequences of hiking for miles. 4. Deliriousness: While it's possible for someone to become delirious during a long hike, particularly if they experience dehydration or extreme exhaustion, it's a less common and less direct impact compared to cramps. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"cramps\\" as the answer because it is the most directly related and plausible consequence of hiking for miles among the presented options."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the stakes rise and nations around the world turn a blind eye to the issue, Ecuador emerges as a dedicated opponent of whaling, determined to preserve marine life for future generations. The story starts with Emily, a passionate marine biologist who discovers evidence of illegal whaling activities on the shores of Ecuador. Realizing the dire situation, she teams up with Carlos, an environmentally conscious Navy officer, and Sofia, a fearless activist, forming the Ocean Defenders. As they investigate the illegal operations, they discover a vast smuggling network led by the ruthless Captain Krieg, who is determined to profit from the sales of whale products in the global black market. With time running out for the whales and risking their lives against a merciless gang of outlaws, the Ocean Defenders must work together to uncover the truth, expose the culprits, and bring an end to the whaling industry. In their quest, the team faces numerous challenges, including evading pirate ships, battling against treacherous waters, and crossing paths with dangerous wildlife. Meanwhile, the Ecuadorian government, under political pressure from powerful nations, faces the difficult decision of whether to support the Ocean Defenders or bow to external demands. As the movie reaches its climax, the Ocean Defenders persevere against all odds, inspiring the people of Ecuador and the world to rally behind their cause. High-stakes action sequences see them confront Captain Krieg's whaling fleet in a battle for the ages, with the majestic blue whale serving as the symbol of hope for all who fight for the protection of the Earth's most cherished resources.

(Associated Press)      Ohio State University President Michael Drake offers words to football coach Urban Meyer, who leaves the stage following a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2018. Ohio State suspended Meyer on Wednesday for three games for mishandling domestic violence accusations, punishing one... (Associated Press)      COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Amid withering criticism of his failing to more directly address domestic abuse issues at a news conference earlier this week, suspended coach Urban Meyer issued an apology Friday to the ex-wife of a former assistant coach who was suspected of abusing her.      Meyer, who is serving a three-game suspension for his handling of abuse allegations and other misdeeds from former receivers coach Zach Smith, was criticized because he declined to address Courtney Smith during a question-and-answer session with reporters on Wednesday night.      \\"Let me say here and now what I should have said on Wednesday: I sincerely apologize to Courtney Smith and her children for what they have gone through,\\" Meyer said in a statement he tweeted and university officials emailed.      \\"My words and demeanor on Wednesday did not show how seriously I take relationship violence,\\" the statement said. \\"This has been a real learning experience for me. I fully intend to use my voice more effectively to be a part of the solution.\\"      Attorneys for Courtney Smith and Zach Smith did not respond to messages Friday night.      An investigative report released soon after Meyer answered questions about his suspension Wednesday night showed that he tolerated bad behavior for years from assistant coach Zach Smith, including domestic-violence accusations, drug addiction, lies and other acts that directly clash with the values Meyer touts publicly.      Zach Smith was arrested after he allegedly abused Courtney Smith in 2009 while working as a graduate assistant under Meyer at Florida. In 2015 Courtney Smith said her husband put his hands around her neck and shoved her against a wall. He wasn't charged in either case.      Zach Smith's attorney said in a statement Wednesday that Meyer and athletic director Gene Smith were \\"collateral damage\\" from Courtney Smith's desire to hurt her ex-husband.      Meyer eventually acknowledged he was aware of the 2015 allegations, but didn't fire Zach Smith until July 24 after Courtney Smith was granted a domestic protection order to protect her from her ex-husband.      Because Smith wasn't arrested for domestic violence in 2015, neither Meyer nor athletic director Gene Smith believed they were obligated to report it to university officials. Gene Smith was suspended for two weeks for his handling of the situation.      When Meyer was asked if he had a message for Courtney Smith directly, he demurred.      \\"\\"I have a message for everyone in this: I'm sorry we are in this situation,\\" he said.      ___      More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 |||||","output":"Ohio State University football coach Urban Meyer has been suspended for three games following criticisms of how he handled domestic violence allegations against former assistant coach Zach Smith.

NY Post editor Col Allan wears Trump hat in the newsroom The New York Post is so awestruck by bloviating billionaire Donald Trump that its top editor has been seen wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap around the newsroom. Col Allan, the paper’s belligerent boss, has been proudly sporting the hat — despite recently siccing his lapdog columnists on other media outlets that have been deemed as “biased” against Trump’s hatemongering. It’s a far cry from The Post’s previous coverage of Trump, which at one point screamed on its front page that The Donald had been “CRUZ-IFIED” in the Iowa caucus by conservative candidate Ted Cruz. Those in Allan’s inner circle shouldn’t be too surprised, as he’s been well known for the favorable coverage he lavishes on celebrities he wants to snuggle up to. And Allan has plenty in common with Trump. The troubled tabloid’s chief, infamous for his tyrannical management style, has also long been accused of harboring the same kind of racist and misogynistic opinions that Trump has displayed on the campaign trail. Allan and the paper were even sued by a former editor in 2009 over alleged employment discrimination on the basis of her race, national origin and sex. Sandra Guzman was fired after protesting internally against an Allan-approved cartoon depicting a slain chimpanzee that many interpreted as a reference to President Obama. Four years later, the paper settled the high-profile lawsuit, but the settlement was just a fraction of the cash The Post has lost in recent times. Industry experts believe the newspaper is hemorrhaging as much as 110 million a year. In response, the company has been pushing to compensate by boosting its digital ad sales — a strategy that Allan has reportedly sabotaged at every turn. “Everyone but Col Allan seems to understand that digital is the future,” says a source at the Post’s Midtown headquarters. Allan’s reluctance to embrace the online world has frequently left him at odds with Post Publisher Jesse Angelo, who has high hopes for the newspaper’s digital brand — but is frequently undermined by the editor. Post staffers have expressed frustration that Allan will direct his minions to intentionally not break stories on what he refers to as the paper’s “silly website.” A source notes that Allan exploded when a colleague suggested installing audience tracking software on his office computer in order to monitor interest in articles appearing on the Post’s website. “I will not have a machine dictate what stories I put in the paper,” the prehistoric print man is said to have roared. It’s been well known that Allan has long wished to return to his Australian homeland. By the rudderless look of the Post’s print product and his attempts to destroy its digital brand, it appears he might soon get his wish. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Col Allan, the New York Post's top editor, has been seen wearing a \\"Make America Great Again\\" hat in the newsroom, which shows his support for Donald Trump. 2.

Allan's resistance to embracing digital media puts him at odds with Post Publisher Jesse Angelo, who has high hopes for the newspaper's digital brand. 7. Allan's reluctance to adapt to new technology and focus on digital success has led to frustration among the Post staff, and his potential departure to return to Australia might be beneficial for the company's future growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: IPad fever flared up around the world Friday, as the Apple device went on sale in the United Kingdom, Japan (where fanboys wore iPad headbands and camped outside stores) and seven other countries. Australia was no exception.      iClothing.com.au The iDress features a front pouch that fits an iPad.      In Melbourne, photographer Matt Irwin avoided the lines and had two pre-ordered iPads delivered Friday morning. “I’ve got them in my hot little hands now and can’t wait to have a play with them,” he said.      Mr. Irwin, who specializes in large-format prints, said the iPad’s screen made it a useful tool for a visual artist.      “As a photographer, it’s great as a mobile presentation platform,” he said. “I’m planning on integrating them quite heavily into my business.”      Fashion designer Davina Reichman attended the launch in central Sydney wearing her own twist on the traditional little black dress, the “iDress,” which has a reinforced pouch in the front to carry the iPad.      “It was inspired by the pouches on kangaroos and koalas,” she said. “Pretty appropriate here in Australia.”      Ms. Reichman came up with the design with her business partner, Luke Staley. “You can hardly notice the iPad when it’s in there. It just sits in there, nice and snug, and you don’t have to carry it around,” she said. “We couldn’t believe no one had come up with the idea before.”      The first run of the iDress (she also offers iTees) sold out online, she said, and her manufacturer was rushing to produce more in the wake of Friday’s launch.      About 400 people turned out at Apple’s central Sydney store for the launch, Mr. Reichman added. “People were queuing around the block — it was iPad madness.”      ______________________________________________________            For the latest news and analysis, follow @wsjd.

LONDON/PARIS |      LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Fans mobbed Apple Inc stores in Europe and Asia as the iPad went on sale outside the United States on Friday, with some shoppers having queued all night to buy one of the coveted tablet computers.      The device, a little smaller than a regular notebook computer and with an open, color touchscreen, is designed for surfing the Web, watching movies and reading, and has been hailed by the publishing industry as a potential life-saver.      Shares of Apple, which also makes the iPod and iPhone, jumped as much as 2.3 percent before settling back to end the session up 1.4 percent, outpacing a sliding market. Analysts said Wall Street had already priced in a big launch.      The iPad's debut sets the stage for Apple to possibly unveil the latest version of its iPhone. Chief Executive Steve Jobs -- keeping up a hectic public schedule after undergoing a liver transplant last year -- is expected to reveal a new iPhone with multi-tasking features on June 7 during an annual developers' conference.      Apple sold a million iPads in the United States in the first month after its April 3 debut, exceeding the most bullish pre-launch estimates. Demand was so heavy that the company delayed the international launch.      RBC Capital Markets estimated iPad's total shipments will reach 8.13 million units worldwide by the end of the year -- which would translate into at least 4 billion of revenue.      \\"I wanted to touch it as soon as possible. I felt real excitement when it was finally in my hands,\\" said Takechiyo Yamanaka, 19, who had camped out in front of Tokyo's flagship Apple store from Wednesday evening to be the first in line.      \\"It's a bit of a gut decision, an emotional decision, because it's not really rationally justifiable,\\" said Anna Kistner as she emerged from the Apple store in Munich, Germany with two iPads. \\"It's a lot of money.\\"      The iPad is now on sale in Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Britain, Japan, Australia and Canada.      Prices for the cheapest, Wi-Fi-only version range from 499 in the United States to the equivalent of 617 in Britain.      The buzz around the iPad helped propel Apple past Microsoft this week to become the world's most valuable technology stock, marking a remarkable turnaround of a company that nearly went out of business in the 1990s.      CREATING A NEED      Apple now gets almost three-fifths of its revenue outside the United States, and it is counting on its base of fans who already own an iPod, iPhone or Mac to add the iPad to their collection as rivals line up with their own tablets.      Analysts said Friday's muted stock reaction came after a build-up of anticipation ahead of the international roll-out, which will be followed in July with launches in about another nine countries, including Hong Kong and Singapore.      On Friday, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch raised its price target on Apple to 325 on hopes of better-than-expected sales of the iPhone and the iPad, plus better margins on the tablet than Wall Street is expecting. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The iPad fever started in many countries as the Apple device went on sale, and people were very excited to get one.

The iPad can be used for many things like surfing the internet, watching movies, and reading. People all over the world really wanted the iPad and were ready to spend money on it.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Water is heated - The heated water evaporates - The salt is left behind - The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The evaporated water is collected - The process is repeated - More salt is removed from the water.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the process is repeated more happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis in the context of the given process, let's break down the process and its correlation with the hypothesis. Step-by-step justification: 1. Water is heated: Heating water increases the kinetic energy of its molecules, creating the necessary conditions for evaporation. 2. The heated water evaporates: When heated, the water molecules with enough kinetic energy escape into the air as water vapor, leaving behind dissolved substances such as salt. 3. The salt is left behind: As water evaporates, the salt concentration in the remaining water increases. This is due to the fact that salt does not evaporate with water. 4. The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface: The water vapor, being cooler now, loses its kinetic energy and reverts to its liquid state upon contacting a cold surface. 5. The evaporated water is collected: The condensed water, which is now purified, is collected separately from the remaining saltwater. 6. The process is repeated: To remove more salt from the water, this process must be carried out multiple times. 7. More salt is removed: By repeating the process, salt concentration in the original water source decreases, providing nearly salt-free water. Now, analyzing the perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that if the process is repeated more, it will affect MORE salt being removed from the water: If the process is repeated more, it should continue to remove more salt since the evaporated water doesn't contain salt. As long as there is still salt in the remaining water, the process can remove it gradually. This repetition indeed has a direct effect on the process: it increases both the salt removal rate and the efficiency of obtaining purified water. The indirect effect of this perturbation hypothesis could be that, with more repetitions, the process demands more time, energy, and resources. Therefore, the supposed perturbation hypothesis indeed has an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process. With more repetitions, more salt will be removed from the water, but the process will also require more resources and time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Jack Butland also looks set to stay with the Potters. Article:","output":"Title: Stoke City Eyeing Oussama Assaidi as Shawcross and Butland Set to Stay Intro: Stoke City may be looking to bolster their squad after a recent knee injury to Peter Odemwingie. With the Potters hoping to keep captain Ryan Shawcross and goalkeeper Jack Butland at The Britannia, the team seems set to make a move for winger Oussama Assaidi to cover for the loss of Odemwingie.  Step 1: Discuss Odemwingie's injury and its impact on the team. Peter Odemwingie's knee injury poses a significant challenge for Stoke City, as his absence weakens their attacking options. As a result, manager Mark Hughes and the club are now searching for a suitable replacement to fill the gap in their line-up to ensure they maintain a formidable attacking presence.  Step 2: Introduce potential target Oussama Assaidi. One player that has caught the attention of Stoke City is Oussama Assaidi, a skilled winger with a proven track record. Assaidi previously had a successful loan spell at Stoke, where he proved his worth by consistently delivering impressive performances.  Step 3: Explain why Assaidi is a suitable replacement for Odemwingie. Acquiring Assaidi would provide Stoke City with an agile and creative attacking option, as the 26-year-old Moroccan international has a keen eye for goal and the ability to create chances for his teammates. His experience and familiarity with the Stoke City squad and their tactics make him an almost seamless replacement for the injured Odemwingie. Step 4: Update on the status of Shawcross and Butland. In addition to potential new signings, Stoke City has also been hard at work securing their key players. Captain Ryan Shawcross and talented goalkeeper Jack Butland are both set to remain with the Potters, despite interest from other clubs. This will be a significant boost for the team, as they hope to build upon their recent success in the Premier League. Conclusion: With the potential addition of Oussama Assaidi to the Stoke City squad and the security of keeping their key players Shawcross and Butland, the Potters are positioning themselves for a strong showing in the upcoming season. Fans can certainly look forward to exciting times ahead, as the team continues to grow and strive for success in the competitive world of the Premier League."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Carbon monoxide poisoning   causes death and injuries around the world. This gas is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. A few years ago, America's Centers for Disease Control (C. D. C.) studied deaths linked   with carbon monoxide poisoning. It found that the number of carbon monoxide deaths in the United States was greatest in January. The C.D.C. also found that carbon monoxide kills more than four hundred Americans each year. And, it said more than twenty thousand people are taken to hospital for treatment of health problems linked with the gas. Carbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color, no taste and no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. Yet, carbon monoxide gas is very deadly  . It steals the body's ability to use oxygen. Carbon monoxide makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues  . It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage   to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts   of carbon monoxide. How quickly this can happen depend on how long a person is breathing the gas and how much gas he or she breathes in. Carbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs . But people have to be awake to realize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. Their stomachs may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly. People develop serious headache as the amount of the gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomachache. Doctors say carbon monoxide influences people differently. For example a small child will experience health problems or die much sooner than an adult. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important. A:","output":"Which statement about carbon monoxide is true, according to the article? A) Carbon monoxide poisoning is only a problem in cold weather regions.

Read this: The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The Homeric Epics (i.e. Iliad and Odyssey) were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity. Who was the author of these tales ? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The author of these tales, the Homeric Epics (i.e. Iliad and Odyssey), is traditionally attributed to a poet named Homer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The term also became a synonym in the Balkans for the social category of shepherds, and was also used for non-Romance-speaking peoples, in recent times in the western Balkans derogatively. Apart from the Romanians and Moldovans, there are indigenous Romance-speaking groups in Greece, Albania and Macedonia, such as the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians. \\"Vlachs\\" were initially identified and described during the 11th century by George Kedrenos. In 1213 an army of Romans (Vlachs), Transylvanian Saxons, and Pechenegs, led by Ioachim of Sibiu, attacked the Bulgars and Cumans from Vidin. After this, all Hungarian battles in the Carpathian region were supported by Romance-speaking soldiers from Transylvania.  At the end of the 13th century, during the reign of Ladislaus the Cuman, Simon de Keza wrote about the Blacki people and placed them in Pannonia with the Huns. Archaeological discoveries indicate that Transylvania was gradually settled by the Magyars, and the last region defended by the Vlachs and Pechenegs (until 1200) was between the Olt River and the Carpathians.  Shortly after the fall of the Olt region, a church was built at the Carta Monastery and Catholic German-speaking settlers from Rhineland and Mosel Valley (known as Transylvanian Saxons) began to settle in the Orthodox region. In the Diploma Andreanum issued by King Andrew II of Hungary in 1224, \\"silva blacorum et bissenorum\\" was given to the settlers. The Orthodox Vlachs spread further northward along the Carpathians to Poland, Slovakia, and Moravia and were granted autonomy under Ius Vlachonicum (Walachian law).  In 1285 Ladislaus the Cuman fought the Tatars and Cumans, arriving with his troops at the Moldova River. A town, Baia (near the said river), was documented in 1300 as settled by the Transylvanian Saxons (see also Foundation of Moldavia). In 1290 Ladislaus the Cuman was assassinated; the new Hungarian king allegedly drove voivode Radu Negru and his people across the Carpathians, where they formed Wallachia along with its first capital Campulung (see also Foundation of Wallachia). what was special about these people?","output":"Vlachs were special because they were a group of people who spoke Eastern Romance languages and lived mostly in the Balkan region. They were known for being shepherds, and their language and culture were different from the people around them. They also played an important role in the history of several countries, like Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, by participating in battles and helping to form new regions such as Wallachia and Moldavia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This fire was so big that it needed many strong and brave firefighters to stop it from spreading and causing harm. These firefighters are like superheroes who drive big red trucks and wear special suits to help them stay safe in hot situations. The fire began during the day, and it was so big that it took them 11 hours to put it out! That means they had to work all night long, even when it was dark outside. They used tons of water, special hoses, and other tools to make sure the fire went away and wouldn't hurt anyone or anything. The firefighters carefully fought this big grass fire near Loch Ness throughout the night and finally, in the morning, they had it under control. They were all very tired from working so hard, but they were also proud of themselves for protecting nature and all the animals that live around the beautiful Loch Ness. This amazing story shows us how important and hard-working our firefighters are. They fight fires in the city or in the countryside, and they work day and night to keep people and the planet safe. So, the next time you see a firefighter in their big red truck, remember to say thank you for keeping everything around us protected from big, scary fires!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The original statement gives us the following information: 1. The subject of the statement is a young girl, implying she is likely still learning and developing her skills in the sport, and therefore may have varying levels of expertise and experience in gymnastics. 2. The girl is about to participate in a gymnastic meet. A gymnastic meet typically involves various events such as floor exercise, balance beam, uneven bars, vault, still rings, and more. The statement does not explicitly tell us which event(s) she will be participating in or her expertise in each event. 3. The term \\"ready to perform\\" can have several interpretations. The young girl could be mentally prepared, physically prepared, or both. Mental preparedness could mean she is confident, focused, or calm. Physical readiness could include her being warmed up, well-practiced, and sufficiently rested.
