Answer the following question: What would have happened if I left before everyone threw brightly colored water on each other ?","output":"If you had left before everyone threw brightly colored water on each other, several things could have happened: 1. You would have avoided getting wet and covered in neon-colored powder: By leaving the scene before the Holi celebrations took place, you would have remained dry and clean. Consequently, your clothes and belongings would not have been stained by the vibrant colors. 2. Your passport would have remained intact: As your passport got accidentally stained during the Holi celebrations, leaving beforehand would have kept it safe and clean in your money belt. This way, the pink dye would not have damaged your passport. 3. No need to apply for a temporary passport: Since your passport would not have been stained and damaged, you would not have needed to spend extra days in Delhi applying for a temporary passport. This would have saved you time and inconvenience while visiting the city. 4. Potentially missed out on the local cultural experience: Although leaving before the Holi celebrations happened would have kept you and your belongings safe from damage, you would have missed the chance to participate in and enjoy an important cultural event. Holi is a joyous and exuberant celebration that brings together people of all ages, and experiencing it firsthand provides a better understanding of local customs and traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Shrek Forever After Movie plot: Shrek has grown steadily tired of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to yearn for the days when he felt like a \\"real ogre\\". When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \\"true love's kiss\\". They soon encounter a band of ogres who are resisting Stiltskin. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Stiltskin. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of...

So much of being a parent is getting past the shock of it all. From the first explosive diaper, to the often-judgmental in-laws, to what feels like the endless inequity of your partner’s contributions, these are the indignities we suffer through as parents of little ones. It’s the reason we rely so heavily on our friendships. Above all else, to safely process shock.      As our kids get bigger, so do the shocks. From the first slammed door, to the occasional “I don’t care what you think!”, to the seemingly endless battles over where they’re going, with whom, for how long…      Prepare, once again, to be shocked.      Imagine your daughter is in 8thgrade. You pick up her cell phone. Maybe you’re just glancing at the battery charge left, or maybe you’re doing a more intentional routine check of her social media. Either way, this is what you see:      8thgrade.      This text was brought to my attention because I run a private online support group called Less Stressed Middle School Parents, where moms and dads frequently reach out for advice on a myriad of challenges we face as parents of early adolescents. Posted topics range from disorganized backpacks to bullying, and from provocative clothing choices to painful loss of friendships. The group is there for people at a time when all those elementary parent friendships you formed start to wane a bit as kids move in different directions, and though the majority of members will never meet in real life, they are there to help process some of the most real and complicated issues we face. It is a lovely, safe, and supportive spot to process these things together.      The mom who posted this image had the following question:      “Need advice…would you or would you not contact the parents of a boy (8th grader) who sends highly inappropriate sexual texts to my daughter? Not the first time nor would it be the last…I have repeatedly asked my daughter to block him, do not respond, etc. This is just ONE of the texts he sent…”      Her post received an unprecedented number of comments, and because of that, it seemed to stay at the top of people’s feeds. This meant people were given time and exposure to overcome the initial shock, keep thinking about, and explore new comments and evolving perspectives as they were posted. Helpful parents and other experts touched so many angles on this issue, I asked the original poster (OP) for her permission to write about it here. (Incidentally, I removed the original post from my online support group to protect her identity going forward.)      How we processed this as a community:      As with most parenting situations that catch us off guard, parents’ emotions ran high, but after a few days became more measured and contemplative. Comments covered many important angles, exploring whether the pervasiveness of pornography influences language and behaviors (yes), the need for better comprehensive sex education (yes please), whether this is harassment or consensual (the group was divided), how our kids’ values may not align with ours (painful but true), how a tween’s interpretation of this message may be very different from an adult’s (flattering, anyone?), implications of the #metoo movement in reporting (whether to, to whom, and how?), the connection between self-esteem and sexuality (this can work both ways), and more. It was fascinating to see people talk it out together and to watch perspectives evolve.      As an author, public speaker and educator, I count this group as one of the biggest accomplishments of my job. We have built a supportive and non-judgmental online community that not only includes smart and thoughtful parents, but other authors and professionals who graciously offer their advice based on years of experience and expertise in the field.      How some of the experts in the group weighed in:      Ana Homayoun, a school consultant and author and of several books including most recently, Social Media Wellness: Helping Tweens and Teens Thrive in an Unbalanced Digital World, believes “One of the conversations adults need to have with kids around smartphone use is around consent and active refusal. If a young person receives messages that are inappropriate and/or make them feel uncomfortable, he or she should have the agency to say, ‘Stop writing this stuff. This makes me feel uncomfortable. I will block you.’ If a young person has a smartphone, he or she should have agency in this situation, and if not, then that is a conversation as well.”      Devorah Heitner, author of Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in their Digital Worldand founder of Raising Digital Natives, says “This is (of course) a totally inappropriate text, but also represents a teachable moment. The sender may really believe the recipient will be flattered and even interested. Clearly the sender needs to be educated about more appropriate ways to flirt and express interest, and about birth control.      “For the recipient, blocking the sender might be sensible, or letting him know that this is offensive and should stop. But it isn’t her job to educate him herself, and if this creates an uncomfortable/unsafe school environment for her, than letting the school know is appropriate. She should be supported in taking any or all of these actions.”      Laura Tierney, founder of The Social Institute suggests teaching kids to Shut It Down. “Coach through Do’s and encourage your child to shut down any sexually explicit comments or requests for nude photos. You may want to ask them, ‘Let’s say someone asked you for a nude photo of yourself. What are some ways you could shut that person down?’ They can be direct and say, ‘I don’t send private info like that,’ or use humor and send funny nude-related images (like a photo of nude eye shadow colors with a line saying ‘these are the only nudes you’ll ever get from me’) or funny emojis.”      Dr. Melisa Holmes, physician and Co-Founder of Girlology, says, “Like most things that have to do with middle schoolers and sex and cell phones – there are lots of pieces to the puzzle: brain development, emerging sexuality, harassment, but then there are the foundational topics of sex education including consent, communication, healthy relationships, self advocacy. Oh, and then there’s the conversation about the language he used. So there is no quick piece of advice.      “Helping middle school kids avoid or navigate things like this requires an ongoing dialogue about all of these topics, as well as spending time ‘rehearsing’ communication skills (but don’t tell your tween/teen that’s what you’re doing!). Then when they are faced with something this challenging, they are more prepared to advocate for themselves and respond in a way that works for them (or they’re more comfortable getting help from that trusted adult who has been having these conversations with them all along!).”      How I weigh in:      In my book, Middle School Makeover: Improving The Way You and Your Child Experience The Middle School Years, I advocate for letting kids solve their own social problems by middle school, unless of course we’re talking about a case of harassment or bullying. I think this is really at the crux of this shocking text. Many parents wondered online, “Is this harassment? If so, does this boy need intervention to ensure he doesn’t continue to cross lines? Or is it a welcomed exchange and merely a young, inexperienced teen saying something dumb?”      My take: The mom admits this text is one of many that her daughter and the boy have been exchanging. Whether the daughter doesn’t block him because she’s enjoying the texts or because she’s afraid to say no, remains unknown. If this were my child, I’d put the boy on hold by texting back “This is her mom and I am removing your contact from her phone until she and I have a chance to discuss these texts.” Then, I’d begin a very non-judgmental and honest series of conversations.      For me, the question becomes less about punishing the boy, and more about how to open up hard conversations between the mom and daughter about what’s appropriate. In fact, the more the mom punishes the boy or her daughter, the more distracted the daughter will become from what she reallyneeds to learn about sex, relationships, and communication.      Often when it comes to young “love” and sexting, what’s really behind it are a teen’s feelings of “Am I the type of person who someone could like this way? Am I pretty? Sexy? Handsome? Worthy?” I understand why anyone at that age would be curious about these things and it would be detrimental to add shame to the mix. That’s why it’s important, despite the shock, to take time responding.      My most important take-away from watching this experience unfold online, is that time brings clarity. Shock encourages a fight, flight, or freeze response from us.      When I am faced with a highly shocking situation with my own child, I tend to freeze with fear – of making the situation worse, of not considering their point of view, of being tooopen to their point of view, of judgement from other parents, of immediate ramifications, and long-term heart ache.      As the parent of a middle schooler, perhaps the better response is none of these. In this situation, what might help is something I call “fostering.”      At times like these, I try to imagine my kid is, in fact, not my kid. I imagine I have suddenly been entrusted with a foster child for whom I want the very best outcome, but with whom I have no history and no future. This helps me decide what is best in the moment without the weight of a timeline full of worry. It restores my feelings of control, reserve, and flexibility. (Isn’t it alwayseasier to parent someone else’s kid in your own mind?) I suddenly feel less inflamed and emotional. Then, I can think about what I want to foster within this child. A sense of self-worth. A knowledge of how to communicate well. An ability to self-soothe. A deeper understanding of how respectful relationships should unfold. A strong foundation of practical knowledge about how our bodies work.      There is no perfect solution to hard problems. But I know when things get complicated, Ilovea list. So, in the simplest form, I suggest these steps for getting through your moments of shock:      1) Make sure your kid is safe.      2) Shut it down until you can talk to your child over one or a few days. (A kid this age can probably only handle so much drama at once.)      3) Consider the perspective of your support group– and strive to keep a support group that has varying perspectives so you’re not trapped in a thought bubble.      4) Consider if you can or should take steps to involve others who can support other affected kids.      4) Make the decision that best fosters your child without letting your own emotions take over.      As parents of middle schoolers, know that more shocks are in store. But you’ve got a game plan, so you’ve got this. And we’ve got your back. ||||| Concerned Mom Leaves Note for Three Teen 'Mean Girls' at Starbucks: 'I Was Crawling Out of My Skin'      Courtesy Michelle Icard      Courtesy Michelle Icard      Michelle Icard, an author and parenting expert, works from home and starts every day at her neighborhood Starbucks. But on Monday, the 43-year-old mother of two says she couldn't enjoy her tea because of a conversation she couldn't help but overhear at the next table.\\"They were so loud and I was crawling out of my skin – I was so physically bothered by what they were saying,\\" Icard tells PEOPLE of the group of girls she overheard at the coffee shop. \\"I kept thinking, 'This is going to stop, one of them will say something to redeem themselves,' but it never happened.\\"Icard could hear every word as the three teens trashed another girl they knew.\\"They were bashing her over what was clearly a popularity issue – and they were talking about gifts they'd received and how tacky they were.\\"Icard was so upset she fled the Starbucks and posted about her experience on her Facebook page . A friend commented, suggesting she go back, order the girls another round and leave a note expressing her concerns.She did. She grabbed a card and scrawled a quick note, essentially telling them the importance of being beautiful both inside and out.The note read:\\"Hi Girls! I sat near you today in Starbucks and listened as you talked. You three are obviously pretty and hard-working. I wish your kindness matched your pretty exteriors. I heard you talk about a girl who sang a song about being lonely in the talent show – and you laughed. About a girl who couldn't be lead singer because you got all the votes, about crappy presents other people have given you … and you sounded so mean and petty.\\"You are smart and you are pretty. It would take nothing from you to also be kind. – M.\\"Icard says, \\"I think that girls who are really pretty in high school can use that as a way of hiding bad behavior, it's almost like they feel like they have the pretty card so they can get away with it. I wanted to speak their language, but also to show them that you have a lot of power with that prettiness and you can hide behind it or you can be kind and it won't take anything away from you.\\"Icard ordered the girls another round, dropped the note at their table and left before they read what she'd written.An updated Facebook post about the experience has reached more than 40,000 people.Icard tells PEOPLE, \\"The reaction has been one of gratitude from parents who say thank you for doing this and other moms who have read this to their daughters and had great conversations about the impact of words.\\"She also blogged about the incident in a post that has also been read by thousands of people, with many referring to the trio as \\"mean girls.\\" Icard says she's uncomfortable with that phrase. \\"Some girls behave meanly. I hate to label girls mean because that's hard to overcome. All of us have been mean and been the recipient of mean behavior.\\"Icard says she was reluctant to get involved, she's ultimately grateful she did.\\"I think so often we hear something that doesn't sit with us and we don't react, but this was something that made me feel pretty terrible and I thought there might be a way to impact these girls in a way that doesn't embarrass them but lets them know what they do in public affects people.\\" ||||| A Facebook post from an author I admire caught my eye over the weekend for the ways it touched on mean girl culture.      Michelle Icard, author of \\"Middle School Makeover: Improving the Way You and Your Child Experience the Middle School Years\\" (Bibliomotion) posted about sitting at her local Starbucks in North Carolina and overhearing three girls, whom she guessed to be in around ninth grade, poking fun at a fourth girl who wasn't present.      RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR      \\"I'm crawling out of my skin sitting next to three very pretty, very boisterous, horribly behaved young teenage girls,\\" Icard posted on Facebook. \\"So far they have laughed about 1) a girl who wrote a song for the talent show about being lonely ... 2) the crappy presents they have gotten in the past from friends 3) girls who copy them. ... It is taking all my restraint to keep from exploding so I'm complaining to you all instead.\\"      Ninety minutes later, Icard shared a follow-up post with a photo of a note she'd delivered to the girls.      \\"I left and went to do my grocery shopping, conflicted the whole time, and I could see the girls still sitting in Starbucks as I drove home,\\" she wrote in the follow-up.      \\"I ran into my house, grabbed a note card and wrote a quick, heartfelt note. Then I ordered three mini frappuccinos on my mobile app and headed back up to Starbucks. They were still there. I walked up to them and said, 'Hi Girls. You don't know me but it looks like you're here studying and I wrote you a note of encouragement.' I handed them the card and walked away. (The drinks weren't ready, but the barista agreed to delivering them for me.)\\"      The note read:      \\"Hi Girls! I sat near you today in Starbucks and listened as you talked.

An author and developer of social leadership workshops for teens had a few remarks to share with three teen girls she overheard at Starbucks. (Michelle Icard)      \\"I have a pretty strong mind-your-own business policy, but I was sitting there having such a visceral reaction,\\" Icard told me. \\"I thought, 'Maybe nobody else is going to give them this feedback. I don't know that they're going to hear this any other way.'\\"      She said she was terrified to hand the girls the note. \\"When I got to the Starbucks, my knees were knocking,\\" she said.      But the chance of inspiring them to evaluate the power of their words compelled her.      \\"My best-case scenario is they would all three go, 'I did not realize how that sounded,' or 'Oh my gosh, I feel bad,'\\" Icard said. \\"That's best-case, but far-fetched. My best realistic scenario is they laughed it off or thought, 'What a weird old lady,' but they went home, and one of them was thinking, 'I felt a little funny saying that stuff, and now I know why.'      \\"Sometimes, at that age, you go along, but you feel a little guilty,\\" Icard said. \\"I hope this causes them to re-evaluate that feeling if they had a little of it.\\"      A handful of people have questioned why Icard commented about the girls' appearance — in the posts and in her note.      \\"I think it's an important part of the story,\\" she said. \\"I think that's a way a lot of girls hide their bad behavior, by fitting in perfectly physically.\\"      I think that's true of grown women as well. Heck, men and boys too.      One of the most fascinating parts of the whole ordeal, in fact, is how quickly it transcends teen girl behavior. Who among us hasn't witnessed — or taken part in — a conversation that left a pit in our stomach? Who hasn't wondered whether and when to speak up?      \\"I think all of us, when we're caught up sometimes, it's easy to forget we're talking about someone who has feelings,\\" Icard said. \\"And just because they're not there doesn't mean it's not hurtful. That's what I'm hoping they realize — maybe in a private, quiet moment later or maybe when they see someone else doing it. Being nice doesn't take anything away from you.\\"      I'm glad Icard weighed in, because I'm a firm believer in the takes-a-village approach to raising good humans. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group achieved worldwide fame during the 1960s. In 1969, Lennon started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono, and he continued to pursue a solo career following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970. Born  John Winston Lennon in Liverpool, he became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Further to his Plastic Ono Band singles such as \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" and \\"Instant Karma!\\", Lennon subsequently produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as  \\"Working Class Hero\\", \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\". After moving to New York City in 1971, he never returned to England again. In 1975, he disengaged himself from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release. Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. From 1971 onwards, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. By 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He had 25 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer or performer. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine?, what is it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship. Question: How does North Korea feel about Donald Trump and Xi Jinping negotiating with each other? Options: - They are wary of any agreements.   - They support it completely.   - They think it's an internal matter.   - not enough information === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"North Korea is likely to be wary of any agreements between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. While there is not enough information to definitively gauge how North Korea feels about the two leaders' negotiations or their stance on specific issues, it is reasonable to assume that they would be cautious. North Korea has long been distrustful of international negotiations, particularly those that involve the United States and China. The North Korean regime sees itself as constantly under threat from external forces, and has been heavily reliant on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs to maintain its perceived security and independence. As a result, North Korea tends to see any negotiations between the U.S. and China, its closest ally, as working against its interests. In recent years, North Korea has criticized China for supporting United Nations sanctions imposed on the regime due to its nuclear and missile activities. North Korea may fear that closer dialogue between the U.S. and China could lead to an even tighter economic and diplomatic squeeze on the country. It is also worth noting that although U.S.-China cooperation may be prioritized by the Trump administration in an attempt to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, North Korea has so far shown little willingness to relinquish its arsenal or participate in multilateral talks over its disarmament. Instead, the regime has consistently pursued a policy of nuclear brinkmanship with the international community. Therefore, it is likely that North Korea is wary of any agreements between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, as they may see such negotiations as a potential threat to their regime stability and security."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

To do that, add 56 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -56 on the right side. 0 + 56 = 14*x - 56 + 56 This simplifies to: 56 = 14*x Step 3: Solve for x Now, you need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 14. 56 ÷ 14 = 14*x ÷ 14 This simplifies to: 4 = x So, the solution to the equation 0 = 14*x - 28 - 28 is x = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Roy Halee is an American record producer and engineer, best known for working with Simon and Garfunkel, both as a group and for their solo projects.  - The Wall of Sound (also called the Spector Sound) is a music production formula developed by American record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in the 1960s, with assistance from engineers Stan Ross, Larry Levine, and the session musician conglomerate known as \\"the Wrecking Crew\\". The intention was to create a dense aesthetic that came across well on AM radio and jukeboxes popular in the era. As Spector explained in 1964, \\"I was looking for a sound, a sound so strong that if the material was not the greatest, the sound would carry the record. It was a case of augmenting, augmenting. It all fitted together like a jigsaw.\\"  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Larry Levine (May 8, 1928  May 8, 2008) was an American audio engineer, known for his cooperation with Phil Spector on the Wall of Sound recording technique.  - \`\` Bridge over Troubled Water '' is a song by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel from their fifth studio album , Bridge over Troubled Water ( 1970 ) . Produced by the duo themselves and Roy Halee , the song was released as the album 's lead single on January 26 , 1970 . Composed by singer - songwriter Paul Simon , the song is performed on piano and carries the influence of gospel music . The original studio recording employs elements of Phil Spector 's \`\` Wall of Sound '' technique using L.A. session musicians from the Wrecking Crew . It was the last song recorded for their fifth and final album , but the first fully completed . The song 's instrumentation was recorded in California while the duo 's vocals were cut in New York . Simon felt his partner , Art Garfunkel , should sing the song solo , an invitation Garfunkel initially declined . Session musician Larry Knechtel performs piano on the song , with Joe Osborn playing bass guitar and Hal Blaine closing out the song with drums . The song won five awards at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1971 , including Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year . The song became Simon & Garfunkel 's biggest hit single , and it is often considered their signature song . It was a number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks , and it also topped the charts in the United Kingdom , Canada , France , and New Zealand . It was a top five hit in eight other countries as well , eventually selling over six million copies worldwide , making it among the best - selling singles . It became one of the most performed songs of the twentieth century , with over 50 artists , among them Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin , covering the song .

Produced by the duo and Roy Halee, it is famous for its inclusion in the 1967 film \\"The Graduate\\". The song was written by Paul Simon, who pitched it to director Mike Nichols alongside Art Garfunkel after Nichols rejected two other songs intended for the film. The song contains a famous reference to baseball star Joe DiMaggio.  - Session musicians, also called studio musicians, are professional instrumental performers who can be hired to play at live performances or in recording sessions. Many session musicians specialize in playing rhythm section instruments such as electric guitar, piano, electric bass, double bass, or drum kit. Some session musicians \\"double\\" on multiple instruments, such as electric bass and double bass or keyboards and guitar, a skill that enables them to play in a wider range of musical styles. Usually such musicians are not permanent members of a musical ensemble with the singers/soloists that they are accompanying and they often do not achieve individual fame in their own right as soloists or bandleaders. However, some backing bands of session musicians have become well known (e.g., The Wrecking Crew). Skills and equipment. The term is applied to performers working in many musical styles, ranging from rock, R&B and soul music to country music. Versatility and excellent technique (having strong rhythmic sense, playing notes and chords correctly, excellent intonation, etc.) are two of the most important skills of session musicians, as they may have to perform songs, tunes and pieces from a range of different styles in a range of different settings, often with little or no rehearsal time or personal practice time. As well,session musicians have an extensive knowledge of musical styles and idioms.   - Gospel music is a music genre in Christian music. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century, with roots in the black oral tradition. Hymns and sacred songs were repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term \\"Gospel Song\\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate.  - \\"The Sound of Silence\\", originally \\"The Sounds of Silence\\", is a song by the American music duo Simon & Garfunkel. The song was written by Paul Simon over a period of several months in 1963 and 1964. A studio audition led to the duo signing a record deal with Columbia Records, and the song was recorded in March 1964 at Columbia Studios in New York City for inclusion on their debut album, \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\\".  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Phillip Harvey \\"Phil\\" Spector (born Harvey Phillip Spector; December 26, 1939) is an American record producer, musician, songwriter, and businessman who developed the Wall of Sound, a music production formula he described as a \\"Wagnerian\\" approach to rock and roll. Spector is considered the first auteur among musical artists for acting not only as a producer, but also the creative director, writing or choosing the material, and masterminding all phases of the recording process. He is acknowledged as one of the most influential figures in pop music history.  - Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer-songwriter and actor. Simon's fame, influence, and commercial success began as part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote nearly all of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: \\"The Sound of Silence\\", \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", and \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\".  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.

This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a  Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. French production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of September 11. The film segments vary widely in content and quality. Two allude to U.S. complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, depicted in the segment by British director Ken Loach; and in Palestine by U.S.-backed Israelis, shown in the segment from Egyptian director Youssef Chahine). Two more recall other destructive acts (a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan; the Japanese \\"holy war\\" against the west in WW II, by Shohei Imamura). Ironies abound in several stories. Shadows that darken the New York City apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the World Trade towers telescope to the ground in Sean Penn's piece, bringing the man momentary joy. But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone. In Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, a missing young man, also in New York City, the son of a Pakistani family, is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist, but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers. There are poignant moments dotted throughout. Loach has his exiled Chilean man quote St. Augustine, to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage: anger at the way things are, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren, exiled in Iran, trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in New York. But they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp, where two men have fallen into a deep well, one killed, the other sustaining a broken leg. This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds.  Idrissa Ouedraogo, from Burkina Faso, creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist, in order to get the 25 million U. S. reward. He tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans, for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute. It is Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (maker of \\"Amores Perros\\") who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment, one that, for the most part, shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic  structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future.

We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house.

You know how we deal with the balance in teeter-totters, right? We're going to do something similar! We have a math problem: 7828 = -1161*d - 9587. The goal is to find out what 'd' is. First, we're going to get rid of the -9587 on the right side. Just like in the teeter-totter, if we want to balance it, if we do something to one side, we should do the same to the other side.  So, we are going to add 9587 to both sides (as -9587 + 9587 equals to 0).  After doing that we get: 7828 + 9587 = -1161*d.  If we add 7828 and 9587, we have 17415 on the left side.  So, our new equation will be: 17415 = -1161*d.  Now we're really close! But on the right side, our 'd' is being multiplied by -1161, right? We need to get 'd' alone. So next, we're going to do the opposite of multiplying which is dividing. We will divide each side by -1161.  After doing that we get: 17415 / -1161 = d.  If we divide 17415 by -1161, we get -15 for 'd'.  So, the result is 'd' equals to -15.  I hope this makes sense to you! It's like solving a puzzle or playing a balance game. We have to make sure that whatever we do on one side, we also do on the other side to keep things fair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Undaunted Newsbeat went in quest of the five awards Sam probably won't win, at least not this year. Ok, so Sam seems like a pretty peace-loving chap. But we fear his schedule may not be able to accommodate international diplomacy until at least 2016. The current holders of the Nobel Peace Prize are Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl educational campaigner who defied the Taliban, along with Indian child rights campaigner Kailash Satyarthi. This is the award given to the best European footballer of the year, voted for by fellow professional players. Cristiano Ronaldo's the current holder, but doesn't Sam look great in Cris's suit? Ok, so this is less of an award and more the most prized tennis trophy on earth. To make it a bit harder for Sam to add this particular bit of bling to his collection, we've set him the challenge of winning the women's singles title. We think that's perfectly fair. The current holder is Petra Kvitova. We suspect she is not worried. Because we fear Sam will make us look silly by winning all of the above, we're making this one *even* harder. Here's how the soul singer might look if he were named Glamour's Woman of the Year. Dutch model Doutzen Kroes, the real winner, is untroubled, we hear. We have no idea whether Sam has secret horticultural powers. He could well be tending to a tray of seedlings in a greenhouse near you right now. But with the Brit Awards around the corner, we're going to give him until he's at least 25 to beat the majesty of this enormous squash.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Nigeria invested in sand mining and started mining coastal barriers.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What position was held by the man that Bach served as Kappelmeister for? from the following article ?  As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV...

Summarize this article: While you may not be able to afford to shop at Prada or Louis Vuitton, you can still visit other places that celebrities also frequent. In L.A., locales like the Brentwood Farmers Market and Whole Foods are often frequented by celebrities doing their shopping. Stores usually don’t look kindly on people who loiter without making purchases. Buying something from the store, even if it’s small or inexpensive, will help ensure that you don’t make yourself unwelcome. Press conferences and premiers often run late, so if you arrive in the morning, you may see the celebrity leaving for work.  Lingering in the hotel lobby may get you in trouble, so consider having a drink in the hotel bar. Sit so that you can see who comes in and out of the hotel. Don't be disappointed if you don't see the person coming into or leaving the hotel. Many large hotels with a celebrity clientele have back entrances to protect their privacy. If you have attended a concert, ask where the tour vans are located, and try to get in that area. Many bands pack up quickly after the show, but some people may be hanging around and could introduce you. Become a waiter at their favorite restaurant, a bartender at their regular bar, or a personal trainer at their gym. Working an eight hour shift greatly increases the odds you will be there when they are there.  Make sure to get a job that lets you interact with the patrons. Jobs like valet parking and coat check, while not particularly exciting, are likely to put you in contact with celebrities dining out or staying in hotels.  Always be professional. Most employers at places that celebrities frequent will not look kindly at potential harassment of their famous clientele. It’s fine to start up a chat or even ask for a photograph under the right circumstances, but if you become a nuisance you’re not likely to keep your job.

Every few days it has minor lava flow eruptions off the coast of Hawaii. People have actually enjoyed swimming in the water above this newly forming volcano because it is very soothing and relaxing.  Will the speed of molecules increase or decrease as temperature decreases? Answer:","output":"When the temperature of a substance decreases, the speed of its molecules typically decreases as well. This is due to the direct relationship between temperature and the kinetic energy of the molecules within a substance. To understand this, it is essential to review the fundamental concepts of molecular movement and temperature. Molecules in a substance are in constant motion, whether in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. This movement is known as molecular kinetic energy. As the temperature of a substance increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also rises. With an increase in kinetic energy, the molecules move more rapidly and collide more frequently with each other. This, in turn, causes the overall energy in the system to increase. In the case of the underwater volcano off the coast of Hawaii, the rising temperature warms the surrounding waters, causing an increase in the speed of their molecules. As people swim in this water, they feel the warmth and find the experience relaxing, perhaps due to the soothing sensation provided by the higher molecular activity in the water. Now, let's consider the opposite scenario. If the temperature of this water were to decrease, the kinetic energy of its molecules would also decline. As a result, the molecules would move more slowly and experience fewer collisions. Essentially, the overall energy of the system would decrease, and the water would feel cooler to the touch. Taking all of these factors into account, we can confidently conclude that the speed of molecules will decrease as temperature decreases. This relationship is consistent across various substances and environmental conditions and is a fundamental principle of physics and chemistry."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

When the children are asleep, Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. At first, Jill dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke. However, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police, who promise to trace the caller if Jill keeps him on the telephone line long enough. Jill, frightened to extreme measures, arms herself as she receives one final call from the nefarious stalker. Soon after the conversation, Jill receives a call from the police, only to find out that the stalker is calling from inside the house. A light comes on at the top of the staircase, and Jill sees the stalker's shadow. In a panic, she immediately runs to the door, unhooks the chain lock only to reveal a close-up of a detective when she screams. The camera then zooms out. Afterwards, Officer John Clifford (Charles Durning) investigates the matter. It turns out that the children were murdered by the perp several hours earlier.

Larry researched saprophytic fungi, while Bill researched parasitic fungi. They later exchanged findings.  But I can use this background: They feed on living hosts. As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed.  What is an answer for this question: Which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Bill researched parasitic fungi while Larry researched saprophytic fungi.  Parasitic fungi are those that feed on living hosts and get their nutrients from them. They use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may cause illness in the host. These disease-causing fungi are classified as parasitic and typically engage in a symbiotic relationship with their host, wherein the parasite benefits at the expense of the host. Saprophytic fungi, on the other hand, are organisms that obtain their nutrients from decaying organic matter. These fungi play a crucial role in breaking down and recycling organic material in various ecosystems, as they decompose dead plants, animals, and other organic materials to extract the nutrients they need for their growth. Given that the question asks which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host, the answer would be Larry. Larry focused his research on saprophytic fungi, which do not get their nutrients directly from living hosts but instead feed on dead and decaying organic matter. On the contrary, Bill studied parasitic fungi, which are known to get their nutrients from living hosts and often cause harm or disability as a consequence. Therefore, it can be concluded that Larry learned less about fungi that rely on living hosts for their sustenance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: MINNEAPOLIS (AP/WCCO) — Two Minneapolis rallies to demonstrate against the grand jury’s decision in Ferguson, Missouri, drew several hundred people on Tuesday, with a scary moment when a car struck one protester and then burst through a pack of other protesters when they quickly surrounded it.      Police said a woman suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital by ambulance. Footage from a news helicopter appeared to show at least one person being driven over as the car left the scene near the city’s 3rd Precinct police station.      The driver called police soon after to report the incident, and police spokesman Scott Seroka said no one was arrested.      The rally near the 3rd Precinct and an earlier gathering at the University of Minnesota both drew hundreds of people carrying signs and chanting slogans in an effort to show solidarity with Michael Brown, the black teenager shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson in August. Ferguson erupted in violence Monday night after a grand jury declined to indict the officer.      On the steps of the university’s Coffman Union, demonstrators sat down for 4 ½ minutes of silence to mark the 4 ½ hours that Brown’s body reportedly lay in the street after he was shot. Some carried signs that read, “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace” and speakers called for an end to racial discrimination.      Nivedita Sriram, 18, a freshman from Darien, Illinois, said the grand jury’s decision showed “systematic injustice.”      “It’s shown our system is broken,” she said.      One of the rally’s organizers, Black Student Union president Michael Ampaabeng, addressed the crowd through a bullhorn: “We believe the family of Michael Brown deserves due process and their day in court.”      Later, protesters marched across campus, chanting: “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now” and “If we don’t get it — shut it down.”      Just after 7 p.m., Minneapolis Police stopped another driver after he drove his van through protesters who appeared to be blocking his vehicle.      Other rallies were planned in St. Paul and Duluth.      (TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2014 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.) ||||| The driver who lurched into a south Minneapolis intersection packed with protesters Tuesday was “attempting to flee from the mob” when he ran into and slightly injured a 16-year-old girl as others perched on the hood of his car, police said Wednesday.      The driver, Jeffrey Patrick Rice, 40, was questioned moments after he drove through the crowd late Tuesday afternoon on eastbound Lake Street at Minnehaha Avenue S. Police said Wednesday that the case “remains under investigation.” Rice, of St. Paul, was not arrested, and no charges have been filed.      His mother said in an interview that Rice was coming home from work and “didn’t even know what was going on” when he encountered the group of several hundred people. The protestors were blocking the intersection as part of a day of demonstrations over Monday’s grand jury decision on the Ferguson, Mo., police shooting.      The girl who was run over by the horn-blaring Subaru station wagon was taken by emergency responders to Regions Hospital for minor injuries. Police withheld her identity because she is a juvenile.      “The victim’s vehicle was damaged by a large group of people,” said the report released early Wednesday by police. “While [the driver] was attempting to flee from the mob, he struck a pedestrian. State accident report filed.”      The Wednesday morning police report listed Rice as a “victim” and the injured girl under a category marked “other.” Later in the day, police changed the listing of Rice to “suspect.” They did not provide additional information or immediately respond to a request for comment.      Rice’s driving history in Minnesota includes three drunken driving convictions, with the most recent coming in 2003, according to court records. He’s also been convicted of driving with an open liquor bottle, and driving after his license was canceled and in violation of restrictions placed on his license. The most recent of these convictions came in early 2008.      All of Rice’s convictions have been for misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors. His sentences have included fines and probation along with stints either in jail or the workhouse, court records show.      State officials said Rice has a valid driver’s license.      Rice’s encounter with the demonstrators unfolded within a few steps of the Police Department’s Third Precinct headquarters, and much of it was captured on a Star Tribune video. Additional video from KSTP-TV shows that Rice paused behind a vehicle stopped in front of him, then steered to the right around that vehicle and drove slowly into the crowd blocking the intersection. There were three people on the hood of his car as he knocked down the girl.      After the girl fell to the pavement, the crowd erupted in screams. Some people ounded on the windshield and windows while the car was stopped momentarily. Rice then moved forward again, knocking down a few more people, the TV video shows.      Gea Ebrahem said she was one of the protesters hit after Rice resumed moving. She said she moved in front of the car to join others who were trying to lift a tire off the teen and pull her to safety.      “My head was in front of the bumper,” said Ebrahem, 24. “I ended up at the bottom of everybody.”      The people who were on the hood of the car, she continued, “didn’t jump on the car because they wanted to. They got hit, and it was a natural reaction [to get onto the hood].”      Despite the momentary mayhem, Ebrahem said, “I just want people to know that the rally was peaceful.”      Soon after leaving the intersection, Rice pulled over and called 911, police spokesman John Elder said Wednesday. No one else was hurt, according to police.      City officials said Wednesday that organizers did not need a permit to hold their protest, despite concerns about the potential disruptions to traffic.      Elder said police were still “actively investigating” the incident before turning the case over to the Hennepin County attorney’s office to decide whether charges are appropriate. ||||| Summary:","output":"Two Minneapolis rallies protesting the grand jury's decision in the Ferguson case drew several hundred people on Tuesday, including a scary incident where a car struck a protester and then proceeded to burst through a pack of surrounding protesters.

However, making inferences and relating this to the general roles of police and government figures, we could suggest that these individuals are essentially representatives or symbols of authority and order.  In terms of your specific question, \\"Police and government figures are examples of what kind of individuals?\\", the widely accepted answer is that they are figures of authority, those involved in maintaining law and order or governance. Considering the roles and responsibilities associated with police and government figures, they are commonly seen as those who enforce laws, maintain social order, and uphold societal standards through the use of authority granted to them. Reviewing the provided passage, Miller's reference to \\"collective wisdom\\" might indicate the notion of 'authority', albeit indirectly. Although this is not directly stated, we could infer that the collective wisdom refers to the common acceptance of certain individuals, such as police and government figures, who are trusted with the task of making decisions or actions that impact the larger population.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Summarize this article: Practice deep breathing relaxation exercises. Deep breathing expands your diaphragm and triggers a calming response in your body. As part of this response, your blood pressure and cortisol levels will drop.  Practice deep breathing by taking in a slow, deep breath so that you fill up your entire lung. As you do so, allow your belly to expand, and then slowly exhale.  You can also practice deep breathing while you meditate or practice yoga. Mindfulness is the technique of living in the present moment and taking your focus away from regrets about the past and fears about the future. Mindfulness can be incorporated into every aspect of your daily life. You can practice mindfulness when you are exercising, eating, working, talking, or reading. Mindfulness research has shown that this practice reduces stress by decreasing rumination. Mindfulness also improves memory, focus, and satisfaction in relationships. To practice mindfulness, focus on your senses and let worries or thoughts about obligations float in and then out of your awareness. Do not linger on any one thought. Instead, try to observe them and then let them pass. Practicing yoga religiously changes the chemical patterns in the body and triggers natural relaxation responses by the body. Yoga promotes a state of biochemical relaxation in the body meaning there is ample oxygen available in the body and heart rate and blood pressure are normal. Apart from physical benefits, yoga also helps in the elimination of toxins from the body. Yoga breathing techniques also have a profound impact on both physical and mental well-being. They help clean up our system to restore balance in our thoughts and emotions. Try taking a beginner yoga class at a local yoga studio or buy a DVD to practice yoga in the comfort of your home. Essential oils can have mood enhancing benefits which aid in stress reduction. For relaxation, it helps to inhale scents of lavender, valerian, citrus, geranium, cloves, camphor and poplar for relief from insomnia associated with symptoms of mental breakdown.  Peppermint essential oil can provide relief from headaches caused by stress and it can even help with nausea and stomach upset, which is also associated with stress. Mix a few drops of peppermint oil with a carrier oil such as almond oil and rub a small amount onto your temples and forehead. Breathe deeply as your rub in the oil to help you relax. In recent studies, essential oils such as lavender oil and lemon oil have been shown to improve mood.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of deep breathing relaxation exercises, mindfulness, yoga, and essential oils in reducing stress and promoting overall well-being.

For nearly 50 years, he successfully stopped 160 people from killing themselves at a cliff  called 'the Gap' - with just a kind word and a smile. Ritchie had served in the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. In 1964, he moved into a house on Old South Head Road. He began saving strangers soon after. Ritchie was a real gentleman who purposely chose to live right across the street from 'the Gap', just because he wanted to continue saving lives. He would wake up every morning and look out of the window for anyone standing too close to the edge of the cliff. If he saw someone and thought they might jump, he would simply walk over with a smile and say, \\"Is there something I could do to help you?\\" That sounds very simple, but it worked - Ritchie tried to have a talk with these people and ended up inviting them back to his house for tea or breakfast. In 2006, Ritchie was given the Medal of the Order of Australia for all his saving lives. In 2010, he and his wife were named Woollahra Council's citizens of the year and in 2011, he was given the Local Hero Award for Australia by the National Australia Day Council. In a situation where most would turn a blind eye, Don has taken action. With such simple actions Don has saved a number of lives. Don's story touched the hearts of all Australians and challenged us to rethink what it means to be a good neighbor. Question: What can we learn from the passage?

Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access.

If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours.

Question: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

They discuss their common interest in Henry Miller. Marcy leaves Paul her number and informs him that she lives with a sculptor named Kiki Bridges (Linda Fiorentino), who makes and sells plaster of Paris paperweights resembling cream cheese bagels. Later in the night, under the pretense of buying a paperweight, Paul visits Marcy, taking a cab to her apartment. On his way to visit Marcy, a 20 bill is blown out the window of the cab, leaving him with only some spare pocket change. The cab driver is furious that he cannot pay. This is the first in a long series of misadventures for Paul that turn hostile through no fault of his own. At the apartment Paul meets the sculptor Kiki and Marcy, and comes across a collection of photographs and medications which imply that Marcy is severely disfigured from burns on her legs and torso. As a result of this implication, and as a result of a strained conversation with Marcy, Paul abruptly slips out of the apartment. Paul then attempts to go home by subway, but the fare has increased at the stroke of midnight and he finds that his pocket change is no longer sufficient to purchase a token.

I think the makers of this movie tried too hard to jam too many liberal dogmas about race relations into one movie.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You take a tray - Add water into the tray - You insert the tray into a freezer - The water molecules begin to slow down - The water becomes ice - The ice cubes are ready.  Question: suppose water surface solidifies in ice tray happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: Less When the water surface in the ice tray solidifies before the rest of the water in the tray has had a chance to freeze, it can potentially lead to less ice cubes being made. Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. Ice formation process: Water, when cooled to its freezing point of 0°C (32°F) or below, will change its phase from a liquid to solid (ice). This process typically starts at the surface of the water, where it is in contact with the cold air or surfaces within the freezer. Once the ice starts forming at the surface, a thin layer of ice will cover the surface, acting as an insulating barrier. 2. Insulation effect: The thin layer of ice that forms on the surface of the water will prevent heat transfer from the liquid water below to the cold air in the freezer. Because heat transfer is inhibited, the water trapped below the ice layer will take longer to cool down to its freezing point. 3. Formation of fewer ice cubes: When the water surface in the ice tray solidifies before the rest of the water has a chance to freeze, it essentially forms an ice shield above the remaining liquid water. As this surface ice layer continues to thicken, it becomes more difficult for the water beneath it to freeze, as the layer acts as an increasingly efficient insulator. As a result, the formation of ice cubes beneath the surface layer will be slowed or even halted, thus leading to fewer ice cubes being created. 4. Uneven freezing: In some cases, the sides and dividing walls of the ice tray might also become frozen before the water at the center of each individual cavity. This uneven freezing pattern could also lead to the formation of fewer ice cubes or ice cubes with irregular shapes. So, the correct answer is B: Less. The solidification of the water surface in the ice tray could lead to fewer ice cubes being made. This occurs because the surface ice acts as an insulating barrier, preventing efficient heat transfer between the remaining liquid water and the cold air in the freezer. Consequently, the water beneath the surface layer may take longer to freeze and may not turn into solid ice cubes at all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Would \\"The group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil and Knowles suffered from depression that lasted for a number of years.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"No. A more detailed and appropriate answer to the question, \\"When was Beyoncé Knowles discovered?\\" would be: Beyoncé Knowles, the critically acclaimed and highly successful American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer, first gained prominence as a member of the all-girl R&B group, Destiny's Child. Born on September 4, 1981, Knowles was raised in Houston, Texas, where her father, Mathew Knowles, managed her early career in the music industry. Beyoncé's journey to stardom began at an early age when she won a school talent show at the age of 7. However, it was during the early-mid 1990s when her talent was genuinely discovered. In 1990, Beyoncé, along with friends Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, formed the girl group \\"Girl's Tyme,\\" which later evolved into Destiny's Child. The group caught the attention of record producers and was eventually signed to Columbia Records in 1997. Destiny's Child soon garnered immense popularity and success worldwide with their debut self-titled album in 1998, which featured songs like \\"No, No, No.\\" It was followed by their second album, \\"The Writing's on the Wall,\\" in 1999, which included their breakthrough hits \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", \\"Bug A Boo,\\" \\"Say My Name\\" and \\"Jumpin', Jumpin'\\". Throughout this time, Beyoncé played a pivotal role in the group's songwriting and emerged as the lead vocalist. Despite facing significant internal conflicts and legal turmoil, which led to multiple lineup changes, Destiny's Child continued to release successful albums such as \\"Survivor\\" (2001) and \\"Destiny Fulfilled\\" (2004). With these albums, the group's fame solidified, and Beyoncé's presence in the music industry grew stronger. Although Beyoncé's initial discovery happened with Destiny's Child, she later found her footing as a solo artist, releasing her first solo album, \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" in 2003. The album instantly became a massive hit, further propelling her career and earning her numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards. So, in conclusion, Beyoncé Knowles was discovered during the early to mid-1990s as a member of the R&B group Destiny's Child. However, it was her various roles in the group and the eventual success of her solo career that ultimately cemented her status as a global icon in the music industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  and the situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which student read more about reactant particles being heated?  Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Given the question: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous?  Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. The answer is:","output":"Alexander is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous.  The given information highlights that Jeremy works on a construction site operating heavy machinery like jackhammers and large welding machines, which produce high decibel levels. These high-decibel sounds are louder, have greater intensity, and are more likely to cause damage to the ears and lead to hearing loss. On the other hand, Alexander works in a library, where he is exposed to much lower decibel levels. Libraries are typically associated with quiet environments and low-intensity sounds. According to the hint provided, every 10-decibel increase in intensity leads to a tenfold increase in loudness. Higher-decibel sounds are dangerous, and thus, Jeremy's workplace poses a greater risk to his hearing than Alexander's workplace. Taking this into account, it is evident that Alexander, who works in a library surrounded by lower decibel sounds, is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous compared to his brother Jeremy, who operates loud machinery in a construction site."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Engineers George Melton and Allan Chadwick work furiously to complete a design on time, even though it is Christmas Eve. Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet.

Its remoteness, previously seen as a disadvantage, was now viewed as an asset for the detention of recalcitrant male prisoners. The convicts detained have long been assumed to be a hardcore of recidivists, or 'doubly-convicted capital respites' – that is, men transported to Australia who committed fresh colonial crimes for which they were sentenced to death, and were spared the gallows on condition of life at Norfolk Island. However, a recent study has demonstrated, utilising a database of 6,458 Norfolk Island convicts, that the reality was somewhat different: more than half were detained at Norfolk Island without ever receiving a colonial conviction, and only 15% had been reprieved from a death sentence. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of convicts sent to Norfolk Island had committed non-violent property sentences, and the average length of detention was three years.

Yi Jianlian (simplified Chinese: Yi Jian Lian ; traditional Chinese: Yi Jian Lian ; pinyin: Yi Jianlian, pronounced [i tcjenljen], EE JEN lee-EN; born October 27, 1987) is a Chinese professional basketball player for the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He has also played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Washington Wizards and Dallas Mavericks. Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2002-03 CBA season, and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles. Yi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22. In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was \\"not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience.\\" Later that year, the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft.  Yi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.  After the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract. What is the first team he played for in America?","output":"The first team Yi Jianlian played for in America was the Milwaukee Bucks, after being selected by them with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: While getting drunk the body can only process so much at a time, go too fast and your belly might just make you what? Options:  A. getting arrested  B. throw up  C. staggering  D. fall down  E. explode Answer:","output":"B. throw up The body can only process a certain amount of alcohol at a time, approximately one standard drink per hour. When you consume alcohol faster than your body can process it, the level of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. High levels of alcohol in the bloodstream can lead to a variety of physical reactions and impairments. One such reaction is nausea and vomiting. When the body senses that it has consumed too much alcohol too quickly, it may respond by activating the vomiting reflex to help rid the body of the excess alcohol. This is the body's attempt to protect itself from alcohol poisoning and further impairment. Therefore, the most logical answer in line with common sense, and the options given, is that going too fast while getting drunk might make your belly cause you to throw up (Option B).

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","output":"Uskon, että tämä eduskunta venyttää uskottavuutensa rajoja. Kun keskustelemme parlamentin uskottavuudesta, on tärkeää ymmärtää, että se voi heijastua monella tavalla. Uskottavuus on parlamentin kykyä edustaa kansalaisten etuja, tehdä tehokasta päätöksentekoa ja luoda luottamusta äänestäjien keskuudessa. Näitä asioita on syytä tarkastella tarkemmin ja yrittää ymmärtää, miksi uskottavuuden rajat saattavat olla koetuksella. Ensinnäkin, parlamentin edustuksellisen tehtävän osalta voi syntyä uskottavuushaasteita. Tämä voi johtua esimerkiksi siitä, että äänestäjien edustus on epätasaista erilaisten äänestysmenetelmien tai vaalipiirijärjestelmän seurauksena. Näin ollen, jos kansalaisten mielipiteet ja tarpeet eivät tule riittävästi kuulluiksi ja edustetuiksi päätöksenteossa, parlamentti saattaa menettää osan uskottavuudestaan kansalaisten silmissä. Toiseksi, tehokas päätöksenteko on välttämätöntä parlamentin uskottavuuden säilyttämiseksi. Jos päätöksentekoprosessi muuttuu liian hitaaksi, byrokraattiseksi tai osapuolia vallitsevaan poliittiseen peliin osallistuviksi, se voi heikentää äänestäjien luottamusta parlamentin kykyyn tehdä ratkaisuja, jotka ovat kansalaisten etujen mukaisia. Tämän seurauksena äänestäjät saattavat tuntea itsensä etääntyneiksi päätöksenteosta ja kokea, että heidän äänellään ei ole vaikutusta. Kolmanneksi, luottamus on keskeinen tekijä parlamentin uskottavuuden kannalta. Luottamuksen säilyttäminen äänestäjien keskuudessa edellyttää avoimuutta päätöksenteossa, integriteettiä ja vastuuvelvollisuutta. Jos parlamentin toiminta kuitenkin nähdään korruption, nepotismin tai muiden epäeettisten käytäntöjen vallassa olevaksi, luottamuksen rappeutuminen voi johtaa parlamentin uskottavuuden heikkenemiseen. Lopuksi on huomioitava, että parlamentin uskottavuuden säilyttäminen on jatkuva prosessi ja että sen on oltava kestävää. Eduskunnan jäsenten ja toimielinten on oltava tietoisia siitä, että heillä on suuri vastuu edustaa kansalaisten etuja ja olla heidän palveluksessaan. Näin ollen, jos eduskunta kykenee vastaamaan näihin haasteisiin ja panostamaan avoimuuteen, eettisyyteen ja tehokkuuteen, sen mahdollisuudet säilyttää uskottavuutensa äänestäjien keskuudessa saattavat parantua merkittävästi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.  At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14.  Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.  Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface).  At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction.

Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

A:","output":"The 1971 television film directed by Steven Spielberg in which the winner of an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series appeared is \\"Duel.\\" The film originally aired as a television movie of the week on the ABC network on November 13, 1971, and later gained cult status. Duel is a suspenseful thriller based on a short story by Richard Matheson. The film follows the terrifying journey of a salesman, David Mann, played by actor Dennis Weaver, as he is relentlessly pursued and tormented by a psychotic truck driver on a desolate stretch of highway. The story focuses on the incredible tension and psychological battle between Mann and the mysterious driver of the truck, whose identity remains mostly hidden throughout the film. Dennis Weaver gave a remarkable performance that earned critical acclaim from both audiences and critics alike. In 1959, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Dramatic Series for his role as Chester Goode in the iconic western television series, \\"Gunsmoke.\\" Weaver went on to have an extensive career in television and film, often portraying memorable characters in westerns and crime dramas.

Process:  - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the oil is not for a stove happens, how will it affect acid rain from the river flow and kill water life.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To examine the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis, which in this case involves the introduction of oil, on the process of acid rain formation and its subsequent impact on river flow, water life, and the overall environment, it is necessary to understand the multiple interconnected factors that would come into play. First, let's review the primary process of acid rain production and its effects on the environment: 1. Acid rain is formed when chemicals, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are emitted into the atmosphere from anthropogenic and natural sources, such as burning fossil fuels, volcanic eruptions, and lightning strikes. 2. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other atmospheric substances to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then fall to the ground as acid rain. 3. Acid rain, with its lowered pH level, can break down rocks and soils, releasing heavy metals and other toxic substances into the environment. 4. It can also destroy vegetation, either through direct damage to leaves and roots or by altering soil chemistry and nutrient availability, which in turn can impact the ability of plants to acquire essential nutrients. 5. The loss of vegetation alters the surrounding environment, as plants play a critical role in maintaining the balance and stability of ecosystems, providing habitat and food resources for other organisms, and regulating hydrological cycles. Now let's consider the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the above process: A. Introduction of oil, particularly in a scenario where it is not being used for a stove (i.e., an oil spill or leakage), would likely have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain and its environmental impacts. Direct effects: - An oil spill or leakage into a water body may cause physical damage to vegetation and wildlife, including water life, by coating the surface of plants, soil, and aquatic organisms with a layer of oil that inhibits the exchange of gases and nutrients. This physical damage may exacerbate the negative effects of acid rain. Indirect effects: 1. If the oil is derived from fossil fuels, its production, transportation, and usage could contribute to the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, increasing the formation of acid rain. 2. Oil spills or leaks may lead to cleanup and recovery efforts involving the use of chemicals and dispersants, which could themselves contribute to water pollution, potentially affecting the acidity of water bodies and further harming aquatic life. 3. The introduction of oil into an ecosystem could potentially alter the food chain or food web dynamics, which may, in turn, affect the resilience of the ecosystem to stressors such as acid rain. 4. Oil spills may increase public awareness and concern about environmental issues, potentially leading to regulatory changes and a shift towards cleaner energy sources that produce fewer sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, thereby indirectly reducing acid rain formation. In conclusion, the introduction of oil into the environment, under the context of the perturbation hypothesis, is likely to have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain formation and its impacts on river flow, water life, and the overall environment. While the direct effects may exacerbate the damage caused by acid rain, the indirect effects could either worsen or help alleviate the problem, depending on various factors such as public response and policy changes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The trick to thawing frozen milk is to use a slow, gradual process, never a quick one. For this reason, the easiest way to thaw your milk is usually simply to transfer it from the freezer to the refrigerator. The slightly warmer temperatures of the refrigerator will allow the milk to thaw to a liquid state little by little. This can take some time — depending on the volume of your frozen milk, it's not uncommon for it to take up to three days to thaw completely in the refrigerator. If you're in a hurry to thaw your milk, try filling your sink with cold water (not hot water) and submerging your frozen milk container in it. Use a heavy object like a cast iron pot to hold the milk underwater as it thaws. This process will be quicker than thawing the milk in the refrigerator but will still usually take several hours, so be patient. The reason that water thaws milk more quickly than the refrigerator has to do with the way that energy is transferred between the milk and its surroundings at a molecular level. Liquids transfer heat energy into ice much more effectively than air, making them a much quicker method of thawing. Never try to thaw your frozen milk quickly with heat. This is a sure-fire method for ruining your milk and undoing your hard work. Heating the milk can cause it to thaw unevenly or even burn, leaving you with a very unappealing finished product. Listed below are just a few tips for avoiding this situation:  Don't leave your frozen milk out at room temperature. Don't thaw your milk in the microwave. Don't thaw your milk in hot water. Don't thaw your milk in a pot or pan on the stove. Don't thaw your milk in the sun. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is that to thaw frozen milk, you should use a slow process, like moving it from the freezer to the refrigerator.

Paragraph: \\"Gail Collins loves telling the story of how Mitt Romney drove his family to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car -- and telling it, and telling it, and telling it. The liberal New York Times columnist has mentioned the incident in print 19 times, by our count. She devoted a column to the incident in 2007 when Romney first ran for president. In another column, she suggested John McCain pick Romney for his running mate \\"\\"so I can repeatedly revisit the time Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the station-wagon roof.\\"\\" And when Sarah Palin was picked instead, and Collins opined that \\"\\"unlike Mitt Romney, she has never gone on vacation with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.\\"\\" Collins regularly includes the incident in jocular news quizzes she writes. (A typical question: Which Republican hopeful \\"\\"continued to fail to explain why he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car?\\"\\" Mitt Romney.) She complained that his 2010 campaign book No Apology didn't mention it, calling it \\"\\"a critical oversight.\\"\\" Last year, just in time for the holidays, she suggested someone make \\"\\"a tasteful Mitt Romney Christmas Ornament\\"\\" depicting the scene of the dog on the roof. And just last week, she noted that the issue wasn't discussed during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library. Romney's top rival, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, reportedly shot a coyote that was threatening his daughter's dog, which made the Romney anecdote relevant. \\"\\"His puppy-rescue is a stirring picture, especially considering that Perry's chief competitor is the man who drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.\\"\\" Aside from wondering why Collins is so obsessed with the story, we also wondered: Is it true? We reached Collins to ask her why she liked the story so much, but she said she'd rather let her columns speak for themselves. (See a picture of Seamus here.) The story of Seamus the Irish setter is not an Internet rumor. It first appeared in the august pages of the Boston Globe in 2007, when the paper published a seven-part profile of Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who had just launched a presidential run. The story of Seamus kicked off Day Four, a story about Romney's family life, written by Globe reporters Neil Swidey and Stephanie Ebbert. It begins in 1983 with a 36-year-old Mitt Romney carefully packing up his five sons and luggage into the family station wagon for a 12-hour trip from Boston to Ontario, where his parents had a cottage on Lake Huron. At the time, Romney was a successful young consultant with Bain & Company, but he hadn't yet started buying and selling companies with Bain Capital in the private equity field. \\"\\"As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. ... Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. \\"\\" Cruel? It's not presented that way in the story, which noted Romney built a special windshield for the carrier, \\"\\"to make the ride more comfortable for the dog.\\"\\" But Seamus must not have been all that comfortable, because he began to experience, um, gastric distress. From the story:   As the oldest son, Tagg Romney commandeered the way-back of the wagon, keeping his eyes fixed out the rear window, where he glimpsed the first sign of trouble. ''Dad!'' he yelled. ''Gross!'' A brown liquid was dripping down the back window, payback from an Irish setter who'd been riding on the roof in the wind for hours. As the rest of the boys joined in the howls of disgust, Romney coolly pulled off the highway and into a service station. There, he borrowed a hose, washed down Seamus and the car, then hopped back onto the highway. It was a tiny preview of a trait he would grow famous for in business: emotion-free crisis management. As the story quickly made its way around the Internet, Romney loathers -- and dog lovers -- had a field day. The liberal blog Wonkette said it showed Romney would be a great commander-in-chief for the notorious Iraq prison Abu Ghraib. David Kravitz of the liberal blog Blue Mass Group called it \\"\\"nuts\\"\\" and \\"\\"classic Romney: it solves a problem efficiently, in a business-like manner, and with no regard whatsoever for the suffering that the solution may cause.\\"\\" Ingrid Newkirk of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals told Time's Ana Marie Cox that Romney was giving his children \\"\\"a lesson in cruelty\\"\\" and that dogs under extreme stress might lose control of their bowels. \\"\\"That alone should have been sufficient indication that the dog was, basically, being tortured,\\"\\" she said. Cox explored whether Romney's actions might have been illegal under animal cruelty laws. (A moot point, because the statute of limitations has long expired.) As to the accuracy of the story, the Globe learned of the incident from friends of the family and confirmed the details with the Romney family. And the candidate himself didn't dispute the report. In fact, in the days following, he defended it. Seamus loved riding in the carrier, Romney told reporters on the campaign trail in 2007. \\"\\"He scrambled up there every time we went on trips,\\"\\" Romney said. \\"\\"He got (up) all by himself and enjoyed it.\\"\\" He also said PETA had targeted him because there was a rodeo at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and because he went quail hunting in Georgia. \\"\\"And they're not happy that my dog likes fresh air,\\"\\" he added. Actually, Seamus had been dead -- of natural, non-station wagon-related causes -- for years when the story appeared. (He had retired to California to live with Romney's sister, who had more space.) We didn't get answers about Seamus from the Romney campaign, but from Neil Swidey, the Boston Globe reporter who unearthed the story. Swidey said he chose the incident to begin his story because he thought it would resonate with readers as an illustration of Romney's approach to solving problems -- trip is interrupted by dog poop, so Romney pulls over, borrows a hose, takes care of the problem, and is back on his way. \\"\\"I certainly didn't write it to make it the basis on which you judge a presidential candidate. The fact that some people appear to be doing that is a little bit crazy. But I can understand why it resonates with people,\\"\\" Swidey said. \\"\\"It's a window into how this guy operates.\\"\\" Swidey said some people see it as evidence of Romney's heartlessness, while others see him as logical man and a problem solver. He confirmed the impression we got from reading the story, that the incident was amusing family lore, and that none of the Romney family was upset or disturbed by the dog riding on the roof. In fact, some of the Romneys said they thought the dog actually liked riding on the roof. (Finally, lest we be accused of utter frivolousness, we asked Swidey what aspects of Romney's biography might be more relevant to voters considering Romney for president. He pointed us toward the Globe's coverage of Romney's business career in private equity, his time as governor and Romney's relationship with his father George, who ran for president himself back in 1968.) Here, we're ruling on Collins' statement that Romney \\"\\"drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.\\"\\" It's important to note that the dog was not literally strapped to the car, as in tied around its midsection. Rather, Seamus was in a carrier with a protective windscreen that Romney had built. The dog's diarrhea might indicate that something was amiss, but Romney's family didn't seem bothered by it. The anecdote is presented in the Globe as funny family story, not as evidence of Romney's barbaric cruelty.\\" Claim: \\"Mitt Romney \\"\\"drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.\\"","output":"The claim that Mitt Romney drove to Canada with the family dog, Seamus, strapped to the roof of the car is supported by several instances mentioned in the paragraph. The story originates from a seven-part profile of Romney in the Boston Globe by Neil Swidey and Stephanie Ebbert, where they discuss Romney's family journey from Boston to Ontario in 1983. To accommodate the family and luggage, Mitt put Seamus, their Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon’s roof rack. Following this, however, the dog suffered from gastric distress due to the discomfort of the journey, which led to a mess on the back window of the car. Regardless, Romney’s family treated this event as more of an amusing family anecdote than a display of cruelty. It is also noted that the dog was not directly tied to the car, but secured inside a carrier that was affixed to the roof, with Romney even having built a special windscreen for the carrier to improve Seamus's comfort. Hence, the claim is essentially true, with a special mention that the story encapsulates Romney’s problem-solving approach and emotion-free crisis management rather than being an instance of animal abuse."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Everyone knows that cockroaches are the ultimate survivors, with enough evolutionary tricks up their carapaces to have thrived for 350 million years and to have completely adapted to the human species.                              But the nature of the adaptation that researchers in North Carolina described on Thursday in the journal Science is impressive even for such an ancient, ineradicable lineage, experts say. Some populations of cockroaches evolved a simple, highly effective defense against sweet-tasting poison baits: They switched their internal chemistry around so that glucose, a form of sugar that is a sweet come-hither to countless forms of life, tastes bitter.      The way the roach’s senses changed, experts say, is an elegant example of quick evolutionary change in behavior, and offers the multibillion-dollar pest control industry valuable insights into enemy secrets, perhaps even revealing some clues for the fight against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, which are far more dangerous to human health than roaches.      Photo      “This is a fantastic discovery,” said Walter S. Leal, the head of the entomology department in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at the University of California, Davis. (Dr. Leal was not part of the research.)      “Sometimes,” he said, “the science is beautiful but you don’t know whether there is going to be an application five years from now, 10 years from now or 100 years.” But in this case, he said, the impact is both fundamental and practical.      Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Jules Silverman and Coby Schal, all at North Carolina State University, who wrote the report in Science, set out to explain a well-known phenomenon: Some populations of German cockroaches (the ones that apartment dwellers see scurrying around in the kitchen at night) avoid poison bait that is laced with glucose, which is supposed to attract them.      This behavior, discovered by Dr. Silverman, “first appeared in the early ’90s,” said Jim Fredericks, chief entomologist at the National Pest Management Association, shortly after exterminators — who now prefer to be called pest management professionals — started using poison baits instead of spraying as the main method of battling roaches. To get around the problem, the industry developed new baits, but the change in roach behavior was a puzzle.      Grzegorz Buczkowski, an entomologist at Purdue University who was not involved in the research, said the industry was always developing new poisons, because roaches and other pests become resistant to their effects, just as bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.      “We lose baits all the time,” he said.      But in this case, the problem was not a poison that had become ineffective. The cockroaches just seemed to avoid any bait that had glucose.      Continue reading the main story Video      Dr. Silverman showed that this behavior was inherited, not something an individual roach learned during its brief life. And a few years ago the North Carolina researchers decided to investigate what caused the change.      Instead of taste buds, roaches have taste hairs on many parts of their bodies. The three North Carolina researchers concentrated on those around the mouth area and on two types of nerve cells that sense tastes and respond by firing electrical signals to the brain. One responds only to sugars and other sweet substances; the other responds only to bitter substances. Whenever a molecule of something sweet attaches to a sweet detector, it fires electrical impulses and the roach brain senses sweetness, which makes it want to eat whatever it is tasting. Whenever a molecule of something bitter attaches to the bitter detector, that cell fires and the brain senses bitterness, which makes the roach want to avoid that substance.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      But somehow the roaches had changed so that the glucose made the bitter detector fire.      “Basically,” said Dr. Buczkowski, “when cockroaches taste glucose, they’re repelled by it because it tastes bitter to them.”      Dr. Schal said the next step was to figure out the details of the genetic mutation that had occurred. Perhaps a mutation changed the molecules that detect bitter substances so that they would be sensitive to glucose, too. Or a different sort of mutation could have caused the dedicated bitter neurons to have lots of standard glucose detectors, which did not exist on those neurons before — a shift that also would have made the insects register sweet glucose as bitter.      The research may be relevant far beyond roach control, perhaps helping to explain the behavior of mosquitoes that spread malaria, Dr. Schal said.      “The mosquito changed its behavior,” he said, “and no longer rests on walls that are treated with insecticide. Instead it tends to rest on the ceiling, or it tends to rest on the outside walls that are not treated with insecticide.      “We still don’t understand the cellular, the neural mechanism responsible for this change in behavior of the mosquito,” he said, so the approach that yielded results with the cockroach could offer useful insights. ||||| Several populations of the German cockroach have become averse to the glucose used as bait in toxic traps, which has severely reduced the traps' effectiveness. Wada-Katsumata et al. (p. 972 ) show that this aversion is a result of changes in the peripheral gustatory system, whereby glucose, as well as “sweet” receptors, stimulated an aversive bitter compound receptor.      Abstract      In response to the anthropogenic assault of toxic baits, populations of the German cockroach have rapidly evolved an adaptive behavioral aversion to glucose (a phagostimulant component of baits). We hypothesized that changes in the peripheral gustatory system are responsible for glucose aversion. In both wild-type and glucose-averse (GA) cockroaches, d-fructose and d-glucose stimulated sugar–gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), whereas the deterrent caffeine stimulated bitter-GRNs. In contrast, in GA cockroaches, d-glucose also stimulated bitter-GRNs and suppressed the responses of sugar-GRNs. Thus, d-glucose is processed as both a phagostimulant and deterrent in GA cockroaches, and this newly acquired peripheral taste sensitivity underlies glucose aversion in multiple GA populations. The rapid emergence of this highly adaptive behavior underscores the plasticity of the sensory system to adapt to rapid environmental change. ||||| Summary:","output":"Cockroaches are very good at surviving, and some of them have now evolved to be even better by changing the way their taste works so that they don't like the taste of sweet things. This helps them to avoid poison traps that use sweet tastes to lure them in.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, let's break them down step by step. Question 1: Step 1: Understand the context of the Navajo Code Talkers. The Navajo Code Talkers were Native American soldiers who used their native language to transmit coded messages during World War II. Step 2: Consider the 21st-century context. In the 21st century, there have been significant advancements in technology and encryption. Step 3: Analyze the effectiveness of the Navajo Code Talkers in the 21st century. Given the advanced encryption methods we have at our disposal today and the fact that the Navajo language is no longer as obscure as it was during World War II, it is unlikely that the Navajo Code Talkers would be as effective. Question 2: Step 1: Understand the context of the Pacific theater. The Pacific theater was a major theater of World War II, where the Allies fought against Japan. Step 2: Determine the role of the Navajo Code Talkers in the Pacific theater. The Navajo Code Talkers played a crucial role in transmitting coded messages that would have been very difficult for the enemy to decipher. Step 3: Identify factors that made Navajo Code Talkers integral. The Navajo language was considered to be very difficult to learn and understand for non-native speakers, which made it incredibly difficult for the enemy to crack the code. They were also highly skilled in combat and able to work well in the challenging conditions of the Pacific theater. Conclusion: The answers to these two questions are not the same. While the Navajo Code Talkers were very effective and integral during World War II, especially in the Pacific theater, their effectiveness in the 21st century would likely be much lower due to advancements in technology and encryption methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Members of the Swedish Association for Sexuality Equality (RFSU) selected \\"klittra\\" from a shortlist of words put together after launching a national competition last year.      The group said it wanted to encourage a single, nationally-recognized word for the activity after noting the absence of such a term in Swedish, while there are numerous words that directly refer to men having solo sex.      News of the planned contest went global when it was first launched November 2014 and the organization received more than 1,200 emails, comments, postcards and letters, and around 200 unique word suggestions.      It later published a shortlist of 40 words for the public to vote on, with \\"klittra\\" proving the most successful and \\"pulla\\" and \\"runka\\" the next popular alternatives.      The RFSU's final decision to promote the word \\"klittra\\" was reached following a poll at an RFSU conference in Västerås, north east of Stockholm, over the weekend, and gained prominence in the Swedish media on Wednesday.      \\"Historically, women's sexuality and not least female masturbation has been taboo,\\" the RFSU said in a statement.      \\"Women are not expected to have desires and be turned on in the same way as men, which is reflected in the lack of words [for masturbation],\\" it added.      The statement noted that one advantage of \\"klittra\\" is that it \\"highlights the importance of the clitoris for pleasure\\".      RFSU is already starting to campaign for the word to be included in the next edition of Sweden's official dictionary (Svenska Akademiens ordlista or SAOL).      \\"Now RFSU members have had their say, the obvious word for female masturbation is klittra. Now we hope that the public begins to use the word so that it is only a matter of time until we see it in SAOL,\\" said RFSU's spokesperson Kristina Ljungros.      Ljungros has previously told The Local that more needs to be done to encourage Swedes to discuss female sexuality.      \\"We are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects, not just the negative ones like sexual abuse. We want to focus on the good parts, the lust,\\" she said.      \\"When it comes to masturbation, people mostly think about just men doing it and we don't think of it as common for women. If we don't have a word in the language, how can we even talk about it?\\" |||||       As many as 50,000 balloons in the yellow and blue colors of the Swedish flag are released into the air above a crowd in Stockholm on June 6, 2008, as Sweden marks its national day. (Scanpix Sweden via AP Photo/ Maja Suslin)      In the Egalia, a preschool in Stockholm, there are no male or female students. Instead, all children are referred to as 'hen' – a gender-neutral pronoun that has become so established in Sweden that it will be recognized next month in the newest edition of the country's official dictionary.      The Swedish Academy's SAOL dictionary, which is updated every 10 years and will be republished April 15, will feature 'hen' as an alternative to the male pronoun 'han' and the female 'hon.' The revised edition will also include thousands of other new words.      According to linguistic expert Sofia Malmgård, the gender-neutral term can be used in two ways. \\"First, if the gender is unknown or not relevant (as in: \\"If anyone needs to smoke, 'hen' may do so outside\\"). Second, it can be used as a pronoun for inter-gender people (as in: \\"Kim is neither boy or girl, 'hen' is inter-gender\\"),\\" she explained.      To many Swedes, the decision of the Swedish Academy reflects how quickly their society has embraced gender-neutral language. \\"Over the last few years, the word 'hen' has more and more found its way into the Swedish language,\\" Malmgård told The Washington Post.      Five years ago, barely anyone in Sweden was aware of the word. The decision to now include 'hen' in the authoritative SAOL dictionary is expected to facilitate an even more frequent use of it in everyday conversations. Set up in 1785, the academy was established with the aim to adapt the Swedish languages to changing cultural and societal influences – a role the institution still feels committed to.      According to experts, the 'hen'-revolution in Sweden has two primary origins: LGBT groups have promoted the pronoun as a way to raise awareness for their cause. However, support for the idea has also come from a more unexpected side: Nurseries, kindergartens and preschools such as Egalia increasingly argue that the pronoun's usage allows children to grow up without feeling the impact of gender biases. \\"The public debate over the pronoun actually only started after the publication of the country's first gender-neutral children's book\\", Lann Hornscheidt, an professor of Scandinavian languages and gender studies at Berlin's Humboldt University explained.      Gender-neutral education in Sweden goes far beyond linguistics. As the BBC already observed in 2011, toys and games in some nurseries are placed deliberately next to each other, in the hope that children will feel free to choose the items they feel most comfortable spending their time with.      To Hornscheidt, the popularity of 'hen' has not come as a surprise. \\"The introduction of a pronoun which challenges binary gender norms has been an important step, following a more thorough debate over the construction of gender within the last 10 years,\\" he said.      The Berlin-based researcher nevertheless cautions that simply introducing a gender-neutral pronoun in other countries may not be sufficient to fight sexism or gender-biases. Turkey, for instance, also has a gender-neutral pronoun. Nevertheless, the country was only ranked 125th in the 2014 gender equality report of the World Economic Forum. Sweden came fourth. ||||| A sex education group in Sweden is looking for an alternative phrase to describe the sexual act, to help normalise female sexual pleasure.      The organisation has launched a competition asked for alternative suggestions to the phrase ‘female masturbation’ and will vote on the winning entry in June 2015.      “We are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects, not just the negative ones like sexual abuse. We want to focus on the good parts, the lust,” Kristina Ljungros of the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (known as RFSU) told a Swedish news site.      “When it comes to masturbation, people mostly think about just men doing it and we don't think of it as common for women. If we don't have a word in the language, how can we even talk about it?”      Entrants were told: “Please note that we are primarily looking for a word, not an expression.      The RFSU has received more than a thousand entries since it launched the competition earlier this month – including ‘klinka’ and ‘flick’.      ‘Selfie’ also made it onto the list, giving a new meaning to the word that made it into the Oxford English Dictionary last year.      But the RFSU has narrowed them down to a shortlist of 34 words including ‘pulla’ and ‘selfa’.      \\"So many people have been discussing the competition all over Sweden so it seems that people agree that there is something lacking in the Swedish language,\\" Ljungros told The Local.      “The absence of one commonly used word for female masturbation suggests that we still don't have gender equality here in Sweden. Hopefully this is another step towards that.\\"      She also said that the debate could be much more of a taboo in other countries, and that Sweden did have a “more liberal attitude to sex”.      Previously the RFSU published research renaming the hymen a 'vaginal corona'.      The idea was to dispel myths surrounding the hymen, which is made up of thin, elastic folds of mucuous membrane just inside the entrance to the vagina.      It has no known function, and is not a thick membrane entirely covering a woman's vaginal opening, as is sometimes believed. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Swedish Association for Sexuality Equality (RFSU) ran a national competition to select \\"klittra\\" as a single, nationally-recognized word for female masturbation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If college athletes were to start being paid, many schools would leave Division I sports, NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday. And the universities that stayed in Division I sports would have to start cutting other, less popular sports to be able to afford the salaries. There would be less competition and no more national championship games — at least not in their current form, Emmert said. Emmert testified at the landmark federal trial for former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He and other athletes are suing for the opportunity for future athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses when they play sports on television. Emmert said he believes the customs that most college sports fans hold most dear -- the camaraderie of game day, the tailgating, the atmosphere of a stadium packed with nearly 100,000 fans and the pride of cheering for a university team -- are at stake. \\"Traditions and keeping them are very important to universities,\\" Emmert said. \\"These individuals are not professionals. They are representing their universities as part of a university community. \\"People come to watch ... because it's college sports, with college athletes,\\" he said. Those beloved traditions go hand in hand with the model of amateurism, and if amateurism goes away, so will the games as we know them now, he said. Many schools lose money on Division I athletics but keep them for the \\"social cohesion\\" and the boost to their profiles, Emmert said. Emmert said officials at several member schools have told him that if athletes were to start getting paid beyond the cost of attendance, institutions would ditch Division I sports and opt for Division II or III, in which coach's salaries, stadiums, hype and scholarships are much smaller. \\"Do the members want the sports to remain amateur?\\" an NCAA lawyer asked. \\"Yes,\\" Emmert replied. \\"If the rules were changed to permit student athletes to be paid for (names, images and likenesses), would that change what college sports is all about? \\"Yes, it would.\\" Never before has the NCAA membership — leaders at about 1,100 colleges and universities — proposed changing the rules to allow college athletes to be paid. However, they are currently considering giving athletes a bit more \\"miscellaneous\\" money to cover the full cost of attending college. Emmert, a much-anticipated witness at the three-week trial, testified for five hours Thursday and is expected to continue on Friday. On the stand, Emmert embodied the NCAA's no-budge, no-compromise take on the issue of pay-for-play, citing the organization's century-old history. In the five years since the O'Bannon suit was first filed, there have been several controversies and many attempts to reform the NCAA. Emmert acknowledged that public opinion of the organization is low and that part of his directive when he took this job was to fix that. While he made no concessions to the argument of hypocrisy in college sports — the idea that everyone else involved makes money, except the athletes — Emmert did concede that the commercialization of college sports is overwhelming the amateurism. He said the use of athletes' names, images and likenesses is \\"one of the most debated topics in NCAA history.\\" One of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson, displayed picture after picture of athletes with corporate logos and asked, \\"Putting athletes in front of logos, that's all fine under NCAA rules?\\" \\"It's not something I'm personally comfortable with,\\" Emmert responded. \\"... It's certainly not where I would prefer the rules be drawn.\\" Responding to questions from U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken about commercial exploitation, Emmert said the schools have chosen to define it to mean that college athletes should not be acting as \\"pitchmen\\" for products. A recent poll conducted by the Saint Leo University Polling Institute showed that 66% of Americans don't think athletes should be paid beyond scholarship money. But complicating the issue are recent academic scandals and consistent court testimony from athletes from several different schools that they were athletes first, not students. Emmert responded by saying that it's hard to get motivated athletes to focus more on schoolwork, but he insisted that they are motivated to play college sports because of the education they receive. But when he was asked about that education, he first mentioned the life experience that athletes earn on the field, then discussed what they learn in class. O'Bannon's lawyers questioned Emmert at length about an e-mail sent to him at the start of his presidency by a senior member of the organization, Wallace Renfro. It said \\"the notion that athletes are students is the great hypocrisy of intercollegiate athletics\\" and said the public believes the athletes are exploited in the name of money for higher-caliber coaches and bigger stadiums. Last week, O'Bannon's lawyers said that even if Wilken were to rule in their favor, the conferences and colleges could still decide on their own not to share any of the television revenues with athletes. As long as the NCAA doesn't have a rule against it, it would still be OK for colleges to choose not to pay. Rules, Emmert testified, are necessary. \\"It's essential there be a body that provides rule-making,\\" he said. \\"One of the most fundamental principles of fair competition is that everyone is playing by the same rules. Everyone understands they are governing and conducting the game the same way from one side of the country to another. You couldn't do it nationally without those rules.\\" As testimony starts in former college star's suit, NCAA settles another suit. NCAA faces change, legal challenges in months ahead. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is talking about college athletes and if they should be paid for playing sports. The NCAA President, Mark Emmert, said that if college athletes start getting paid for playing, many schools would not be able to afford it and they would have to leave Division I sports. This would result in less competition and no more national championship games. College sports fans like the traditions and atmosphere of games, and paying the athletes might change that. Some schools already lose money on sports, but keep them for the social benefits and reputation.

Not wanting to plan/heavily participate in a second baby shower: - Personal preference: It could be due to personal or emotional reasons, and not necessarily unethical. - Potential harm: There is no inherent harm caused to others by not participating or planning a second baby shower. 2. Suing an ex-friend for 20k because of them disrespecting me: - Motivation: The motivation behind the action is a feeling of personal disrespect, which is a subjective criterion. - Potential harm: This action could cause financial distress and further damage relationships. Comparing both actions, suing an ex-friend for 20k for a subjective feeling of disrespect appears less ethical than not wanting to plan or participate in a second baby shower.

Vendôme, one of the best French generals, took command and was substantially reinforced; Prince Eugene managed a draw at the Battle of Luzzara but the French recovered most of the territory lost the year before. In October 1703, Victor Amadeus declared war on France; by May 1706, the French held most of Savoy except Turin while victories at Cassano and Calcinato forced the Imperialists into the Trentino valley However, in July 1706 Vendôme and any available forces were sent to reinforce France's northern frontier after the defeat at Ramillies. Reinforced by German auxiliaries, Prince Eugene marched on Turin and the siege was broken by the Battle of Turin on 7 September. Despite a minor French victory at Castiglione, the war in Italy was over; the Convention of Milan in March 1707 confirmed Austria's control of Milan and Mantua, with French troops given free passage back to France for redeployment elsewhere. An attack by forces from Italy on the French base of Toulon was planned for 1707 but was postponed when 10,000 Imperial troops were diverted in June to seize the Spanish Bourbon Kingdom of Naples. The delays contributed to the failure of the siege of Toulon; by the end of 1707, fighting in Italy ceased apart from attempts by Victor Amadeus to recover his trans-Alpine territories of Nice and Savoy. What did the French not control in Savoy?","output":"According to the provided text, the French did not control Turin in Savoy. This can be deduced from the line: \\"by May 1706, the French held most of Savoy except Turin\\".

This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:  An inventor named Nelly is tinkering around in her home office where she has created two new types of material that could be used in products. The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table.  Which material is less resistant to changing shape? The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine which material is less resistant to changing shape, we need to analyze the results of Nelly's test. Here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. Nelly secures one end of the Glubber material to a table, stretches it, and then releases it. The Glubber quickly snaps back to its original position. This indicates that it has a strong elastic force, which makes the material more resistant to changing its shape. 2. Nelly performs the same test with the Malk material. When she stretches the material and releases it, the material slowly crawls along the floor, taking its time to return to its original position. This indicates that the elastic force in the Malk material is weaker, making it less resistant to changing its shape. Based on the results of the test, the material that is less resistant to changing shape is Malk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who clashes with Robert? from the following article ?  Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.  However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion. A:","output":"The full name of the man who clashes with Robert in the article is Wedge Donovan.

Gold Is Hot This Year. So Are Fakes David Myers, a pharmacist in New York, wanted to increase his gold holdings, but he had a concern. How could he know if the gold coins he examined in a shop were real? “I knew there were a fair amount of fakes out there,“ Mr. Myers said. ”There were a lot of good deals that I passed up on because I didn’t want to take the chance.” What was this article about?","output":"The article, titled \\"Gold Is Hot This Year. So Are Fakes,\\" discusses the increased occurrence of counterfeit gold coins in the market and the concerns it raises among potential buyers such as David Myers, a pharmacist based in New York. The article portrays Myers' eagerness to expand his gold holdings while simultaneously highlighting his apprehensions about the authenticity of the gold coins he encounters in shops. The piece sheds light on the growing popularity of gold as an investment option, resulting in a high demand for the precious metal. The surge in gold prices has inadvertently increased the number of forged gold coins circulating in the market, with fraudsters looking to capitalize on this demand. In light of this worrying trend, investors like Myers are forced to exercise caution when purchasing gold coins, often opting to pass up on seemingly lucrative deals due to the risk of acquiring counterfeit items. The article likely delves into the reasons behind the escalating number of fake gold coins and explores the consequences faced by unsuspecting investors who fall prey to these scams. Furthermore, the piece might touch upon the various methods that investors can use to identify and avoid counterfeit gold coins and discuss the role of governments, financial regulatory bodies, and certified dealers in combating this growing threat. The article serves as a reminder to investors and collectors to remain vigilant and well-informed about this issue, especially during a period when gold continues to be a sought-after investment option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If you brush your teeth too roughly, over time it can cause your gums to recede. Brushing gently with a soft bristled brush can allow your gums the ability to recover. There are some electric toothbrushes that will give you a warning when you are pushing too hard. If you have a history of brushing too hard, this might be a good product to invest in. If you have receding gums, it may be caused by a lack of basic dental care. If you haven't been brushing, start brushing twice a day. This will minimize the buildup of bacteria and food debris around your gum line, which will allow your gums to grow back.  Be sure to use a toothpaste that has fluoride in it. If you really want to keep your teeth clean, begin brushing your teeth after each meal. Flossing daily will remove food debris, bacteria, and plaque build up from between your teeth. This will allow the gums in between your teeth to remain healthy. There are also special picks and brushes that your dentist may recommend for cleaning between your teeth. If you are grinding or clenching your teeth, the force you are creating can make your gums recede. To soften this force and allow your gums to regenerate, start wearing a bite guard.  Signs that you are grinding your teeth include a sore jaw or face, chipped or flattened teeth, tooth pain, and an unexplained headache.  Many people choose to wear their bite guard at night, when teeth grinding can occur involuntarily. If you are suffering from dry mouth, it can also increase the likelihood that your gums will recede. To increase your saliva production, try chewing sugar-free gum regularly or talk to your doctor about medications that can help increase the amount of saliva you are producing. Saliva protects the gums from bacteria and plaque build up, so having too little of it can impact your gum health. Summary:","output":"Brushing your teeth too roughly can cause gum recession, so use a soft-bristled brush and consider investing in an electric toothbrush with pressure warnings. To promote gum health, practice proper dental hygiene by brushing twice a day or after each meal, flossing daily, and using fluoride toothpaste. Special picks and brushes may also be recommended by your dentist. If you grind or clench your teeth, wear a bite guard to reduce force on your gums.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").  - Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636, whose history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - Charles Sumner \`\` Chuck '' Stone , Jr. ( July 21 , 1924 -- April 6 , 2014 ) was a Tuskegee Airman , an American newspaper editor , columnist , professor of journalism , and author .

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\".  - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context.

The term \\"Ivy League\\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II.

I read this background article the other day: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.  I am facing a new situation today: Ken is a microbiologist. He got two samples of yeasts, yeast A and yeast B, from two different businesses. Yeast A is used in a bakery, and yeast B is used in a brewery. He has to decide the characteristics of each  yeast sample for further study. Interestingly, despite all his curiosity, Ken doesn't like any yeast to be around him.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: If Ken doen't like any yeast around him, which yeast  he should not worry about, yeas A or yeast B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Ken should not worry about either yeast A or yeast B being around him.  Here are the steps to justify this answer: 1. Both yeast A and yeast B are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, according to the background article.  2. Yeast A is used in baking, while yeast B is used in brewing. Therefore, both of them are commonly utilized in their respective industries, which means they have distinct characteristics tailored for those purposes. 3. It is important to note in the background article that baker's yeast, a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is commonly found on and around the human body. Since both yeast A and yeast B are strains of the same species, it can be inferred that they are both naturally occurring microorganisms that would be around humans regardless of Ken's preference. 4. As Ken is a microbiologist, he is likely trained to work with and around microorganisms, including yeast. It would be expected for him to encounter these yeasts in his line of work, so not wanting any yeast around him would be an impractical preference.  In conclusion, Ken should not be concerned about either yeast A or yeast B being around him, as they are both strains of a species naturally found around humans, and as a microbiologist, he should be equipped to handle them professionally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Robert Frost and Thomas Sigismund Stribling both share American nationality. Before diving into their common nationality, let's discuss their individual backgrounds and achievements to understand their connection better. Robert Frost (1874-1963) was an American poet, born in San Francisco, California, known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech. Raised primarily in Massachusetts, he published his first poem in 1894 and subsequently gained tremendous recognition and admiration. Throughout his lifetime, he was honored with four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. His most prominent works include collections like 'North of Boston,' 'Mountain Interval,' 'New Hampshire,' 'A Further Range,' and others. With poems such as \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\\" and \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay,\\" Frost has secured his place as one of America's most celebrated poets. Thomas Sigismund Stribling (1881-1965), born in Clifton, Tennessee, was an American writer and novelist, primarily known for his works of social protest. Stribling studied at the University of Alabama and later became a journalist, teacher, and attorney. His Southern-set novels focused on critical evaluations of the social order, racial prejudice, and economic inequalities in the United States between the Civil War and the Civil Rights Era. Some of his notable works include 'Teeftallow,' 'The Store,' 'The Forge,' and 'Unfinished Cathedral.' His writing earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1933 for his novel 'The Store,' making him one of the pioneering southern writers during the early 20th century. In conclusion, both Robert Frost and Thomas Sigismund Stribling were American by nationality. They each contributed significantly to American literature, especially poetry and prose, respectively. While they might have approached their literary works differently, their shared nationality played a role in shaping their perspectives and influencing their writings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Exhibit A: a man who skied through the streets of suburban Detroit on 1 February, carving S-turns down a snow-covered road as he was being towed by a car – until police intervened. Incredibly, Detroit news station WXYZ-TV was interviewing the mayor of Warren, Michigan, about hazardous driving conditions and showing live footage of the road when the skier cruised past. Told of the incident, mayor Jim Fouts wasted no time in condemning the stunt. “It’s horrendous,” he told the station. “That driver would certainly get a ticket if there was a police officer in that area. It’s very dangerous.” Moments later, as the station continued to broadcast live, a police car pulled over the skier, bringing the stunt to an end. Urban skiing isn’t exactly new. More than a decade ago, skiers and snowboarders inspired by skateboarders began sliding down handrails and other man-mad features found in snowy cityscapes. The practice continues today, with adherents often trying to stay a step ahead of local police. Needless to say, not all skiing near major cities has to end with police intervention. Some urban centres – Interlaken, Switzerland comes to mind – have more favourable conditions nearby. In fact, almost all of these cities would make fine choices.","output":"A skier was caught on live TV being towed by a car through a snow-covered road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan, as local news station WXYZ-TV was interviewing the city's mayor about hazardous driving conditions.

Among the topics we address in our course is the retention  of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim  position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

To do this, we want to get rid of the constant term on the right side of the equation.

Article: Left unfettered  , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed   hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit  . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy   in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy  , a trend called \\"age compression  \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that...

Step 1: Combine like terms The equation given is -z + 4*z - 9 = 0. We see there are two terms involving z: -z and 4*z. We can combine these two terms by adding them together. (-z) + (4*z) = (-1 + 4) * z = 3 * z So, the equation becomes: 3*z - 9 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable z Now, we need to isolate z on one side of the equation. To do this, we will first move the constant term, which is -9, to the right-hand side of the equation by adding 9 to both sides of the equation: 3*z - 9 + 9 = 0 + 9 This simplifies to: 3*z = 9 Now, to find the value of z, we simply need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is 3: (3 * z) / 3 = 9 / 3 This simplifies to: z = 3 So, the solution to the given equation -z + 4*z - 9 = 0 is z = 3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What gene makes grapes purple? Is Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, your statement provides the basic explanation, but it might be helpful to delve a little deeper to present a more comprehensive response.  The color transformation in grapes, like purple grapes, is mainly related to the production of a group of chemicals called anthocyanins, which belong to the larger class of molecules called flavonoids. More specifically, these anthocyanins are mainly synthesized during the last stages of grape maturation.  Anthocyanin synthesis is controlled by a complex network of genes. The two regulatory genes that you mentioned in your statement are likely referring to VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2. Mutations in these two genes indeed prevent the production of anthocyanins, resulting in white grapes instead of the common purple ones. However, let's also note that environmental factors, like pH, light exposure, and temperature, can influence the color of grape berries too, demonstrating that it's not just genetics that play a role. So, while the specific genes involved are important, anthocyanin production — and therefore grape color — is a result of a complex process rather than the action of a single gene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From a snowy Christmas lunch in Antarctica to the spectacular light projections currently brightening the facade of Sydney's St Mary's cathedral, the world is gearing up for Christmas in style. But for festive fun, little compares to London's very own Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, which, as these stunning images reveal, comes with lashings of Christmas cheer. Also enjoying a spot of festive cheer were the crew of HMS Protector, a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, who stopped for an early Christmas lunch on an Antarctic ice floe. Scroll down for video. Festive fun: The crew of HMS Protector, an ice patrol ship, tuck into an early Christmas lunch while sitting on an Antarctic ice floe. Lunch was followed by a football match. Working holiday: The crew were forced to have their celebrations early because the ship will be at sea on Christmas Day which means there will be no time to celebrate. Record attempt: Chefs in Ham, a village in France's Picardie region attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the planet's longest Yule Log. Although the ship will be at sea on Wednesday - leaving no time for Christmas fun - Captain Rhett Hatcher allowed his crew time off for a roast turkey dinner in a real-life winter wonderland and a game of football. Captain Hatcher said: 'Spending Christmas in the coldest, windiest and driest place on earth comes with a number of challenges but it is a truly unique privilege.' Closer to home, a group of intrepid French pastry chefs attempted to break the record for world's longest Christmas log in the northern French commune of Ham in the French Picardie region. Equally tasty were the offerings of traders at the Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park, who enjoyed a bumper day as shoppers ventured out in search of the perfect present. The temporary, festive theme park runs for over six weeks and features an ice rink, several large rides and numerous food and gift stalls. Tasty: The chefs have to beat the Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La, which in 2011, created a new Guinness World Record with a 1068-metre long Yule log. Festive: A trader serves up a selection of beautifully decorated gingerbread hearts at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park. Sparkling: The historic park has been transformed into a festive paradise complete with a neon ferris wheel, an ice rink and a miniature train set. Tasty treat: A warmly wrapped up couple inspect the colourful penny sweets on display at one large stand at Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland. Spectacular: Winter Wonderland has become an annual tradition and continues until January 5th 2014, although it is closed on Christmas Day. Further north, Bradford residents were enjoying the 18 Christmas-themed ice sculptures which were installed at City Park, Bradford, by artist Jamie Wardley earlier this month. Among them are characters from Wardley's own story, The Children of the Snow and the Boy with the Little Idea, and a life-sized sleigh complete with elves. In Country Durham, the Beamish Open Air Museum got a festive makeover, complete with lights for its collection of vintage trams and buses. A working steam carousel turned under the cover of darkness, while Santa Claus answered children's wishes in his fireside grotto. But perhaps most spectacular of all were the light images that appeared on the side of St Mary's cathedral in Sydney. Entitled Lights of Christmas, the light show includes projections of stunningly detailed biblical scenes, a portrait of Mary and baby Jesus and a gorgeous starry night. Magical: A local inspects three of the 18 ice sculptures on display in Bradford's City Park. The pieces are the work of children's author and artist Jamie Wardley. Old-fashioned: The Beamish Open Air Museum in Country Durham has had a festive makeover, complete with vintage lights and traditional Christmas trees. Edwardian: The Beamish Open Air Museum in County Durham includes trams, buses and shop fronts from 100 years ago, including this tram with original ale adverts. What'll it be this year? A colourfully-dressed Father Christmas greets Libby Cooper, nine, and her sister Grace, eight, at the Beamish museum's vintage grotto. Tradition: A woman making a Christmas cake at the Beamish museum. The fruitcake's origins date back centuries to when dried fruit and spices were a delicacy. Engineering: The attractions included an original steam carousel, left, and a working early 1900s tram, right, at the Beamish Open Air Museum in County Durham. Christmas spirit: An Edwardian musical duo played traditional folk songs on the cobbles of the replica town at the Beamish museum in County Durham. Lego: Mike Addis and Catherine Weightman spent 10 weeks making a 10ft gingerbread house out of 125,000 Lego bricks at their home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Barmy: The house is the latest in a long line of giant lego decorations which the couple have made for their children Tom, 21, Holly, 18, and Christopher, 15. Biblical: Scenes projected onto the walls of St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney include the Annunciation and Joseph and Mary's journey to Bethlehem (right) Tradition: The spectacular yearly light show has become a popular part of Christmas for Australians living in Sydney. Tribute: A series of differing portraits featuring the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus are projected onto the walls of the Sydney cathedral. Festive: A vast Christmas fir tree and a beautiful scene featuring a magical starry night complete the light show at Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral.

Now, let's break down the logic behind each potential answer: A: Betrayed by their friend - In this scenario, Kendall, who is presumably a friend of Jan, shared confidential information about Jan's actions to Jan's brother. Jan might feel exposed and betrayed by their friend, who chose to divulge this sensitive information instead of respecting Jan's privacy. B: Happy people know - It would be unlikely for Jan to feel happy that others now know about their weed-smoking habit, especially given the choice of location (behind bleachers) which indicates a desire for secrecy on Jan's part. Additionally, the reaction of family (in this case, Jan's brother) is unpredictable in such circumstances, potentially resulting in uncomfortable conversations or a potential loss of trust, which would not make Jan feel happy. C: Relieved it's out in the open - Although there's a possibility that someone might feel relieved when a secret is out in the open, in this context, it seems far more likely for Jan to feel betrayed or upset. Given the private and secretive nature of the location and the activity, Jan probably would not want their brother or others to know about their behavior. In conclusion, Option A: Betrayed by their friend is the most fitting answer to the question of how Jan would feel, based on the provided context. It encompasses the likely emotional response to a friend revealing sensitive personal information to a family member without Jan's consent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Screeching Weasel is an American punk rock band originally from the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights, Illinois. The band was formed in 1986 by Ben Weasel and John Jughead. Since their formation, Screeching Weasel have broken up and reformed numerous times with numerous line-up changes. Ben Weasel has been the only constant member, though Jughead was present in every incarnation of the band until 2009. The band originally called themselves All Night Garage Sale but changed their name to Screeching Weasel, a variation of a name a friend had suggested, Screaming Otter, which was a reference to a T-shirt that read, \\"I'VE GOT A SCREAMING OTTER IN MY PANTS!\\". Shortly after their formation, Weasel decided that it was too difficult to play bass and sing at the same time, so Vince Vogel, who took the stage name \\"Vinnie Bovine\\" joined as the band's bassist. The band recorded their debut album, Screeching Weasel, in one night for 200 and released it on Chicago label Underdog Records in 1987.  In 1988, Bovine was fired from the band and was replaced with Warren Fischer, better known as Fish, and former member of the band Ozzfish. The band recorded their second studio album, Boogadaboogadaboogada!, which featured Weasel playing second guitar (he would later state that he only played on about a quarter of the songs) and made a name for themselves by opening a show for Operation Ivy at 924 Gilman Street. Steve Cheese was fired from the band shortly after the recording due to his unwillingness to tour outside of Chicago. He was replaced by Aaron Cometbus for two shows who then was replaced by Brian Vermin. Boogadaboogadaboogada! was released in late 1988 on Roadkill Records, a label formed by investor David Best and managed by Ben Weasel following an introduction of the two by producer Mass Giorgini.  After what Weasel described as a \\"disastrous\\" tour, Fish left the group and was replaced by Dan Schafer, originally nicknamed \\"Sewercap\\" and later renamed Danny Vapid. The new band members recorded an extended play entitled Punkhouse for Limited Potential Records soon after that. The band ended up recording four more songs in 1989 that were featured on compilations, featuring a second guitarist Doug Ward, who also joined the band for several live performances. Screeching Weasel disbanded when Vermin and Vapid stated that they wanted to leave the band to concentrate on their side project, Sludgeworth.

Hoffman's modem peers are not so fortunate.The Mrs. Robinsons aren't sitting around at home any more.They are out in the workplace,doing the high-powered jobs the graduates want,but cannot get.For those fresh out of university,desperate for work but unable to get it,there is a big imbalance between supply and demand.And there is no narrowing of the gap in sight. Parents feel as badly let down as the young people themselves.Middle-class families see their graduate offspring on the dole   queue and wonder why they bothered paying school fees.Working-class families feel an even keener sense of disappointment.For many such families,getting a child into university was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.It was proof that they were living in a dynamic,economically successful country.That dream does not seem so rosy now.Graduate unemployment is not,ultimately,a political problem.Job-creation for graduates is very low down in the government's schedule.If David Cameron's Conservatives   had a brilliant idea for guaranteeing every graduate a well-paid job,they would have presented it by now.It is a social problem,though a more deep-seated social problem than people perhaps realize.

Rachel was pregnant and couldn't move.;","output":"Carrie asked a lot of demands from Rachel since Carrie was pregnant and couldn't move. Carrie's pregnancy played a significant role in the dynamic between her and Rachel. As Carrie's pregnancy progressed, her mobility and ability to perform daily tasks became more challenging. This situation led to her leaning heavily on Rachel for support and assistance. Carrie was experiencing the common physical and emotional changes that women go through during pregnancy. These changes include weight gain, hormonal fluctuations, and blood volume increase, all of which can contribute to discomfort and fatigue. These factors caused her to struggle with her movements and severely limited her ability to perform daily tasks without help. Additionally, as the baby in Carrie's womb grew bigger, her center of gravity shifted, making her more susceptible to strains and injuries. This further limited her ability to move around and attend to her daily needs, such as cleaning, cooking, and shopping. To ensure a smooth and healthy pregnancy, it was crucial for Carrie to conserve her energy and avoid overexertion. Due to her limited mobility, she relied on Rachel to help her manage household tasks, run errands, and provide emotional support during these challenging times. In this scenario, Rachel, being a good friend, stepped up to the plate and offered the necessary support to Carrie. Rachel understood the physical and emotional strain of pregnancy and extended her help in various forms. She was not only available to provide logistical assistance, like picking up groceries and supplies or cooking meals, but also offered emotional support, advising and comforting Carrie in her moments of worry or stress. Overall, Carrie's pregnancy and resulting limitations drew her to ask for more demands from Rachel, who willingly and empathically provided the required support. Although the situation may have led to Rachel's increased workload and emotional burden, it ultimately strengthened the bond between the two friends as they navigated through this challenging yet rewarding period of life."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Kidnapping of Ukrainian patriots has Russia's full support, says Kiev The last time Vladimir Rybak was seen alive was on Thursday 17 April . The local councillor was walking away from the city hall in the eastern Ukrainian city of Gorlovka after taking part in a pro-Ukrainian flashmob in the central square. Three days earlier, separatists had seized the government building, taking down the Ukrainian flag and replacing it with the tricolour of the Donetsk People's Republic. According to friends, Rybak, who was 42, made no secret of his strong anti-separatist views. \\"He was entirely open – and at times impulsive,\\" fellow councillor Yurii Zhuk said. After the demonstration Rybak tried to barge his way into the Gorlovka city hall and take down the rebel flag. A video captured what happened next. Pro-Russian protesters jostled Rybak; they refused to let him inside; a youth in a balaclava grabbed his arm and led him away. Zhuk said that Rybak and a friend then left the square, tracking away from its Lenin statue, and headed towards the city's Palace of Culture. A Kia car pulled up, and four men in masks and military fatigues jumped out and grabbed him. Rybak's friends assume the kidnappers must have had a gun. \\"Vladimir was a sportsman and an ex-policeman. He knew how to handle himself,\\" Zhuk said. Over the weekend, Rybak's battered body was found in a river near the separatist stronghold of Slavyansk, 60 miles away. According to investigators, he had been tortured. There were stab marks on his stomach and bruising on his chest. Rybak's kidnappers tied a sandbag to his body and drowned him while he was unconscious. On Wednesday, , his widow Elena, a 49-year-old doctor, and 25-year-old son Yura, went to Slavyansk to retrieve his body. The gruesome case is the latest in a string of kidnappings and murders in eastern Ukraine which Kiev blames on Russia and its undercover agents. Law and order in Slavyansk and surrounding areas of the Donetsk region has deteriorated dramatically. In Kramatorsk, pro-Russian gunmen hijacked the security agency HQ. They also beat up the city's deputy mayor and kidnapped its police chief – both supporters of Ukrainian unity. The situation in Slavyansk, the separatists' fortified capital, appears to be one of gun rule. Pro-Russian militias continue to hold an American journalist, Simon Ostrovsky, taken hostage early on Tuesday, as well as several Ukrainian reporters including Irma Krat. The gunmen have threatened western correspondents, evicted Roma families from their homes and apparently imprisoned the local mayor. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the \\"people's mayor\\" of Slavyansk said that Ostrovsky wasn't a hostage as such but was being \\"held\\" by his militia. He described the journalist as a \\"provocateur\\" and berated the media for not reporting on the fate of pro-Russian activists arrested by Kiev for separatism. The mayor gave no indication of when Ostrovsky might be released. He said he was being kept in good conditions, with enough to eat, and the opportunity to wash. In the past week, 16 people have been kidnapped in Slavyansk and Gorlovka, and two murdered, including Rybak. Rybak was a deputy for the Batkivshchyna party of Ukraine's acting president, Olexsander Turchynov, who announced on Tuesday that Kiev would now restart military operations against pro-Russian separatists in the east. The body of a second party supporter, unidentified, was found near Rybak's. Both had been tortured to death, Turchynov said. \\"The terrorists who effectively took the whole Donetsk region hostage have now gone too far, by starting to torture and murder Ukrainian patriots. These crimes are being committed with the full support and connivance of the Russian Federation,\\" he said on Tuesday. There were few signs of an offensive on Wednesday, however. Ukraine's interior ministry claimed it had flushed gunmen out of a small town called SvyatBISogorsk, just outside Slavyansk, but there had been no previous reports of gunmen in the town. It is unclear if Kiev's latest military operation will be more successful than a similar attempt last week. That ended in humiliating failure when well-organised pro-Russian gunmen captured six Ukrainian armoured vehicles sent to Kramatorsk, 10 miles from Slavyansk. Either way, it is clear that the international deal to defuse the crisis, agreed last week in Geneva, is dead and buried. The EU called on Russia on Wednesday to ensure an immediate end to the kidnappings and killings in eastern Ukraine. But Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused Kiev of violating the Geneva statement, and warned that Russia would respond if its interests were attacked in Ukraine. Lavrov used an interview with the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT to accuse the US of \\"running the show\\" in Ukraine, saying it was quite telling that Kiev announced a new military campaign immediately after a visit by the US vice-president, Joe Biden. \\"If we are attacked, we would certainly respond,\\" said Lavrov, who recalled the 2008 war with Georgia over breakaway South Ossetia. In the capital, Kiev, , Ukraine's SBU security service revealed details of Russia's alleged role in Rybak's abduction and murder. Officials named two Russian agents as the masterminds behind special operations in the east of Ukraine. Both agents work for Moscow's GRU military intelligence wing, the officials said. Zhuk said he last saw Rybak in Gorlovka's central square half an hour before his abduction. They had agreed to meet at 10am the next day. \\"That someone can be kidnapped in 2014 in the centre of Europe is terrible. I don't have words,\\" he said. Who was responsible? \\"Radical elements who exist in the city. The fact that he was found in Slavyansk confirms this was the work of separatists.\\" According to Zhuk, the majority of Gorlovka – a mining and industrial city of 275,000 people – do not support the separatists' cause. But he said Russian television had had a brainwashing effect, with many people now unable to tell \\"what was true and what a lie\\". He stressed: \\"The big majority are peaceful.\\" Zhuk described calls for an anti-Kiev referendum on 11 May as completely absurd, saying: \\"There is no legal basis for it.\\" He is one of three representatives in the 75-seat city assembly for the Europe party. The police had done little to halt the breakdown in public order, he said. \\"They are demoralised, and split into two halves: one group supports the Donetsk People's Republic, the other Ukrainian unity. There's no unified leadership. Nor are there any clear orders from Kiev.\\" He said he had sympathy for young officers, aged 25 or so, who were supposed to deal with angry crowds armed with just a stick. Rybak was elected to Gorlovka's city council in October 2010. A father of two, he had previously worked as a detective, heading up the investigations unit. Another councillor – Oleg Gurbanov, an independent – said he had disagreed with Rybak over many topics, but respected him for his forthright views. \\"I absolutely condemn the people who did this. Everybody has a right to life,\\" Gurbanov said. The Donetsk People's Republic flag still flies above the building, even though normal work resumed last week after the separatists left. \\"I want a united Ukraine. But we've left [the flag] up there for now to try and avoid conflict,\\" Vasily Mirozhnik, head of public affairs, explained. Who was behind Rybak's murder? \\"It's a riddle,\\" he said.","output":"A man named Vladimir Rybak, who was against separating from Ukraine, was last seen in Gorlovka city. Some people who supported Russia didn't like what he was trying to do, so they kidnapped him when he was walking with a friend. Later, they found him dead in a river, and he had been hurt really badly. This is not the only time this has happened, and many people believe that Russia is helping the bad people who are doing these things."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Connecticut is not known as a hotbed of seismic activity, but residents in and around Plainfield, in the eastern part of the state, have felt tremors more than a half dozen times in the past few days.      The first reports came in Thursday morning, Jan. 8 -- a 2.0 magnitude earthquake centered near Danielson, about 10 miles from Plainfield, near the Rhode Island border. By some accounts, as many as nine more quakes, one reaching as high as 3.3, were reported over the next six days, including six on Monday and one early Wednesday. The cluster of quakes, all close together both in time and in place, is what scientists call a \\"swarm.\\"      Yet another quake hit Plainfield early Thursday -- this one a 2.2 magnitude temblor.      USGS      \\"Moderate to large earthquakes are rare in New England, but as we have seen over the past week, Connecticut is not immune to earthquake activity,\\" Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection commissioner Dora B. Schriro said in a statement Wednesday. \\"These small quakes have not and typically do not result in injuries or significant damage to property, but we want to assure everyone that we continue to work with all of our public safety partners to mitigate any potential issues that may arise.\\"      \\"This is fairly unusual,\\" said Maureen Long, an assistant professor in the geology department at Yale University. \\"It's definitely been an interesting week for us.\\"      Long said that swarms are not unprecedented in Connecticut -- one in the 1980s in the village of Moodus, farther west in the state, comprised hundreds of small quakes -- but they are very rare.      Connecticut is located in the middle of a tectonic plate, far from a boundary where the movement of two plates can cause strong and frequent quakes, like in California. But the geology of the state is actually quite complex, owing to lots of tectonic activity in its prehistoric past.      Plainfield is not far from an ancient fault called the Lake Char-Honey Hill line that formed when the Pangea supercontinent was assembled about 400 million years ago. Like most faults in Connecticut, it is not thought to be active, but some of these old faults can build up stresses that lead to structural failures that cause earthquakes.      \\"The hypothesis is that you're getting the release of stress when these ancient faults are breaking,\\" Long told CBS News. But scientists can't be sure that the fault, which lies about 5 km (about 3 miles) underground, was responsible for the tremors. \\"If you look at a geological map of eastern Connecticut, there are a lot of faults and there may well be faults we don't know about because they don't extend to the surface. It's hard to associate a particular earthquake with a particular fault when it's far away. But it's certainly reasonable.\\"      It's similarly challenging to say what might have precipitated a quake, especially in a location that is far from the tectonic shifts that usually cause seismic activity. In states such as Oklahoma, fracking has triggered seismicity, but Long said that's not the case here. \\"In Connecticut we don't have the right geology for natural gas, so there is no fracking. These is no evidence that this is anything other than a natural process.\\"      One theory points to glaciers which covered the Northeast tens of thousands of years ago. The weight of the massive volume of ice pressed down into the earth, and like a memory foam mattress regaining its shape, the land might still be working its way back into place. This process, called glacial rebound, could be the source of the stress that has caused the quakes.      The downside of being in a region that doesn't get a lot of earthquakes is that there is a dearth of data to help predict activity. It's a challenge for scientists to forecast when a quake might come in southern California; it's even harder in Connecticut.      \\"It's impossible to predict how long this swarm will last. It's within the realm of possibility that it will last weeks, or months, or end tomorrow,\\" said Long.

I read this background article the other day: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers had very different diets. Vick would constantly eat foods high in fat and would frequently overeat. Zack on the other hand, had a higher metabolic rate, a faster metabolism, and he would eat the correct amount of calories.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brother had a lower chance of becoming obese? A:","output":"Given the information from the background article, you have learned that obesity occurs when the body mass index (BMI) is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater, resulting from consistently consuming more food energy than needed, which leads to the storage of unused energy as fat. Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Using this knowledge, you can now analyze the situation with the two brothers, Vick and Zack. Vick has a diet high in fat and frequently overeats, which means he regularly consumes more food energy than his body requires. This excess energy is then stored as fat in his body, increasing the chances of him becoming obese. On the other hand, Zack has a higher metabolic rate and a faster metabolism. This means that his body is more efficient in burning the calories that he consumes, converting them into energy for his body's daily activities. Additionally, Zack eats the correct amount of calories, ensuring that he only consumes the necessary energy for his body's needs. Therefore, Zack is less likely to store excess fat as a result of his diet and lifestyle. So, considering the factors discussed above, the brother with a lower chance of becoming obese is Zack, as he has a higher metabolism, consumes the right amount of calories, and his body efficiently burns the energy he consumes, minimizing the storage of unused energy as body fat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are a family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish. They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish.  - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

Northwest Strikes: If Northwest flight attendants go on strike on the 15th, what does that mean for travelers? I have a trip booked on the 24th. Will NW rebook us with other airlines? Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? people should book their flights to avoid the strike for their own reasons","output":"If Northwest flight attendants go on strike on the 15th, this could have significant implications for travelers who have planned trips with Northwest Airlines. The scope and duration of the strike will determine the extent of its impact on flight schedules and passengers' travel plans. Here is a more detailed analysis of the situation: - In the event of the strike, Northwest Airlines may face flight cancellations or delays. This would directly affect passengers who have booked flights during the strike period. The airline might attempt to minimize this impact by reassigning some of its workforce or by rearranging its flight schedule. - If the strike continues until the 24th, it is highly likely that your trip will be affected. Northwest might offer you alternative options, such as rebooking your flight on a different date or providing a refund for the ticket. However, these solutions may not be ideal for all passengers, as they could disrupt travel plans or be financially inconvenient. - Northwest may also collaborate with other airlines to rebook affected passengers on alternate flights, either during or after the strike period. This would depend on the availability of flights and the agreements between Northwest and partnering airlines. However, there is no guarantee that all passengers will be accommodated by other airlines, as airlines typically prioritize their own passengers first during disruptions. - For passengers who wish to avoid the uncertainties associated with the strike, it may be beneficial to proactively reschedule their flights to a date beyond the planned strike or to explore alternative airlines and routes. However, this could incur additional costs and the responsibility would lie on the passengers themselves to make these changes. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement \\"people should book their flights to avoid the strike for their own reasons\\" carries some truth. In an effort to minimize the impact on their travel plans and to have control over potential disruptions, passengers may want to avoid booking flights during a period when a strike is scheduled or could potentially occur. By taking proactive measures, such as rescheduling flights or considering alternative airlines, passengers can better ensure a smoother and less stressful travel experience."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Spam   mail is a fact of Internet life. Some of it carries bad things, but the main problem with spam is that it is unpleasant because it fills your mail box with pointless messages. Most email programs have built-in filters   that will discover unwanted messages and put them into a junk folder  . You can make the filter learn what you consider to be spam or block certain senders. Avoid letting your email address appear on websites--spammers search the Internet for email addresses. Be careful who you give your email address to, and if you need to send out several copies of an email, use blind copy instead to cover the other people's addresses. Delete   spam emails without opening them. Signs of possible spam are bad spelling in email headers, strange sender addresses, or emails sent at unusual hours. If you do open a spam mail, never reply to it or click on any pictures it may have. If you receive an unexpected email pretending   to come from your bank, credit card company or other suppliers, be very careful. If the email asks you to reply, don't do it!

De asemenea, Grupul ECR consideră că opţiunile sexuale, libertatea de reproducere şi dreptul la sănătate sunt chestiuni în care trebuie să decidă fiecare stat în parte şi fiecare stat membru. Translate to English","output":"Additionally, the ECR Group believes that sexual preferences, reproductive freedom, and the right to health are matters that must be decided by each state individually and by each member state. The ECR Group, or the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, is a political group that operates within the European Parliament. They maintain the belief that issues related to sexual preferences, reproductive freedom, and the right to health should be determined by individual member states, rather than being governed by overarching policies or regulations imposed by external authorities. By granting each state the autonomy to make decisions in these areas, the ECR Group posits that there will be a stronger sense of national sovereignty and an increased respect for the country's specific cultural, social, and political contexts. Sexual preferences, in this context, encompass a wide range of topics, from LGBTQ+ rights to sexual education policies in schools. Reproductive freedom involves matters such as access to contraception, family planning, and abortion services. Lastly, the right to health refers to the availability, accessibility, and quality of healthcare services in a given country. By emphasizing that each state should have the agency to make decisions about these matters, the ECR Group aims to promote a balance of powers and allow for a more responsive and flexible approach to handling these issues. However, critics may argue that this approach could lead to inconsistencies in how sexual and reproductive rights are treated across Europe, potentially resulting in different standards of protection and assistance in various countries. Overall, the ECR Group advocates for an approach that recognizes the independence and varied policy stances of individual states, encouraging each country to make decisions that they believe will best serve the interests and values of their population. This, in turn, may result in a diverse landscape when it comes to sexual preferences, reproductive freedom, and the right to health across the European Union."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The gray whale (\\"Eschrichtius robustus\\"), also known as the grey whale, gray back whale, Pacific gray whale, or California gray whale is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a length of , a weight of , and lives between 55 and 70 years. The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted. The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus Eschrichtius, which in turn is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae. This mammal descended from filter-feeding whales that appeared at the beginning of the Oligocene, over 30 million years ago.  - A bristle is a stiff hair or feather (natural or artificial), either on an animal, such as a pig, or on a tool such as a brush or broom.  - Keratin is one of a family of fibrous structural proteins. Keratin is the protein that protects epithelial cells from damage or stress. It is the key structural material making up the outer layer of human skin. Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are tough and form strong unmineralized epidermal appendages found in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin.  - The blue whale (\\"Balaenoptera musculus\\") is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (Mysticeti). At up to in length and with a maximum recorded weight of and probably reaching over 181 tonnes (200 short tons), it is the largest animal known to have ever existed.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Rorquals / rrkwl / ( Balaenopteridae ) are the largest group of baleen whales , a family with nine extant species in two genera . They include what is believed to be the largest animal that has ever lived , the blue whale , which can reach 180 tonnes ( 200 short tons ) , and the fin whale , which reaches 120 tonnes ( 130 short tons ) ; even the smallest of the group , the northern minke whale , reaches 9 tonnes ( 9.9 short tons ) . Rorquals take their name from French rorqual , which derives from the Norwegian word røyrkval , meaning \`\` furrow whale '' .  - Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as whalebone whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are a widely distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically thought to have descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - The bowhead whale (\\"Balaena mysticetus\\") is a species of the family Balaenidae, in suborder Mysticeti, and genus \\"Balaena\\", once thought to include the right whale.  - The fin whale (\\"Balaenoptera physalus\\"), also called the finback whale, razorback, or common rorqual, is a marine mammal belonging to the suborder of baleen whales. It is the second-largest animal after the blue whale. The largest reportedly grow to long with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9 m (85 ft), a maximum recorded weight of nearly , and a maximum estimated weight of around . American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale \\"the greyhound of the sea... for its beautiful, slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship.\\"  - Baleen is a filter-feeder system inside the mouths of baleen whales. The baleen system works by whale opening its mouth underwater and taking in water. The whale then pushes the water out, and animals such as krill are filtered by the baleen and remain as food source for the whale. Baleen is similar to bristles and is made of keratin, the same substance found in human fingernails and hair. Baleen is a skin derivative. Some whales, such as the bowhead whale, have longer baleen than others. Other whales, such as the gray whale, only use one side of their baleen. These baleen bristles are arranged in plates across the upper jaw of the whale. Baleen is often called whalebone, but that name also can refer to the normal bones of whales, which have often been used as a material, especially as a cheaper substitute for ivory in carving.  - Roy Chapman Andrews (January 26, 1884  March 11, 1960) was an American explorer, adventurer and naturalist who became the director of the American Museum of Natural History. He is primarily known for leading a series of expeditions through the fragmented China of the early 20th century into the Gobi Desert and Mongolia. The expeditions made important discoveries and brought the first-known fossil dinosaur eggs to the museum. His popular writings about his adventures made him famous.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny the best metal album of all time? , can you please find it?   As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.... The answer to this question is:","output":"Mikael Åkerfeldt.

Article: As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops.

Megan, a sophomore in college, is visiting her grandparents who live out of town. There is a party going on at her grandparents' house because her grandma, Emily, has just retired. There is cake and ice cream and people are talking about their jobs, and Emily is talking about all the good and bad memories she has from her work.  Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To put a worm on a fishing hook.","output":"Putting a worm on a fishing hook might seem tricky at first, but with a bit of practice, it will become second nature. Worms are commonly used as bait because they are readily available and are well-liked by a variety of fish species. To securely attach a worm to a fishing hook, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather your materials: Before you begin, ensure you have everything you need at hand. This will typically include a fishing rod, a reel, fishing line, a box of worms, and most importantly, a suitable hook. 2. Choose your worm: Select a worm from your bait box. Healthy worms that are plump, vibrant, and wriggly tend to be more attractive to fish. Be sure to handle the worms gently so as not to damage or kill them before they are used as bait. 3. Hold the worm securely: To get a firm grip on the worm without causing any damage, pin it down gently with your thumb and forefinger. It will likely squirm, but try not to squeeze it as this can harm the worm. 4. Pick the right spot to insert the hook: One effective technique is to hook the worm twice, once near its head and again near its tail end. This will anchor the worm securely, increase durability, and allow it to wriggle naturally in the water. 5. Push the hook through the worm: With the worm held securely, take your hook with your other hand and carefully insert the sharp end into the chosen spot, which should be just behind the worm's collar (near its head). Push the hook through the worm until it emerges on the other side. 6. Slide the worm up the hook: Carefully slide the worm up the hook, threading as evenly as possible. Be sure not to bunch it up, as this can inhibit the natural wriggling movement that attracts fish. The worm should be almost entirely on the shank (the long part) of the hook, with only the hook's point and barb exposed. 7. Insert the hook through the second spot: Now that the worm is partially threaded onto the hook, find a spot near its tail end to insert the hook again. Carefully push the hook through the worm until it emerges on the other side. 8. Adjust the worm as needed: Once the hook is inserted through both spots, it should be securely anchored onto the hook. You can make slight adjustments to ensure the worm is evenly spread out, allowing it to move enticingly in the water. 9. Care for your worm: Keep the remaining worms in a cool, dark place, and handle them as little as possible to maintain their health and viability as bait. 10. Cast your line: With the worm now securely on your hook, you are ready to cast your line into the water and start fishing. Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you practice putting worms on a fishing hook, the more proficient you will become. Soon, you'll be able to do it quickly and skillfully, maximizing your chances of catching fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Begin by obtaining all the necessary ingredients: rosemary focaccia, orange marmalade, ricotta cheese, fennel salami, and pepper. 2. Take the rosemary focaccia and cut it horizontally to create two equal halves. This will allow you to create a sandwich with a top and bottom piece. 3. On one side of the split focaccia, spread a generous amount of orange marmalade. This will serve as a sweet component to balance out the flavors of the sandwich. 4. On the other side of the split focaccia, spread a generous amount of ricotta cheese. This will act as a creamy and slightly tangy element in the sandwich. 5. Sprinkle some pepper over the ricotta cheese layer to add a little bit of spice and flavor contrast to the sandwich. 6. Take thinly sliced fennel salami and evenly distribute it on top of the ricotta cheese layer. This will be the main protein component of the sandwich and will provide the savory and meaty element. 7. Close the sandwich by putting the marmalade-covered side of the focaccia on top of the salami layer.

Article: Water skiing is a sport with many social, economic and health benefits to society. It is unique in that it is a sport where able and disabled persons, and people as young as 5 years and as old as 80 years of age can participate alongside each other. It is a sport that involves more than one person, and is a wonderful family activity that gathers members together for a day of fun at a favorite waterway. Anyone who has put on water skis can attest to its health benefits--it is a sport that demands and develops strength, agility and endurance. The sport includes several disciplines  including slalom, tricks, cable, jump, ski racing, kneeboard, wakeboard, and barefoot, with each of these practiced for either recreational or competitive enjoyment. Safety Tips for Water-Skiers Don't take unnecessary risks while water-skiing. The following tips will help you safely enjoy this thrilling sport: ALWAYS have an observer in the boat. This is a legal requirement in many states. The boat driver cannot watch the skier and operate the boat safely at the same time. ALWAYS wear a Coast Guard approved Personal Flotation Device (PFD) designed for water skiing. Ski belts are NOT recommended. Your approved PFD will help keep you afloat. NEVER ski in rough water. High waves or a choppy sea will prevent the tow boat from maintaining a steady course and speed. NEVER ski after dark. It is dangerous AND illegal. Any boat traveling fast enough to tow a skier is traveling too fast to navigate safely at night. NEVER water-ski while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Such activity is extremely dangerous because of the impairment to your judgment and ability to respond. A recent study conducted with expert skiers who were purposely drunk indicated that even their ability to ski was dramatically reduced. Use hand signals between the skier and observer. Agree before you start what each signal means so there is no confusion at a critical moment. Question: Which of the following is against law while water skiing? Options: A: An observer doesn't watch the skier. B: A skier doesn't fasten his safe belt. C: Go skiing at midnight. D: Go skiing after drinking wine. The answer to this question is:","output":"C: Go skiing at midnight. Justification: According to the article, it states that skiing after dark is both dangerous and illegal.

Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.  He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter.  Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role.  Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word.  He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959).

Summarize this article: A new and troubling trend in which youth deliberately do not eat and then go on to drink alcohol in excess appears to be sweeping US college campuses, new research suggests.      Known as \\"drunkorexia,\\" the practice refers to a combination of diet-related behaviors, such as food restriction, excessive exercise, or binge eating and purging, with alcohol use, lead investigator Dipali V. Rinker, PhD, research assistant professor, University of Houston, in Texas, told Medscape Medical News.      Dr Rinker's research showed that 8 of 10 college students, many of whom were men, recently engaged in at least one behavior related to drunkorexia.      The aim of the practice, said Dr Rinker, seems to be to get drunker or get drunk faster. This may involve induced vomiting, the consumption of laxatives or diuretics, or not eating at all before drinking.      Dr Rinker presented the findings at the 39th Annual Research Society on Alcoholism Scientific Meeting in New Orleans.      The study included 1184 college students from the University of Houston and from a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace. All participants completed a Web-based survey. They had to have engaged in at least one episode of heavy drinking in the past 30 days. An episode of heavy drinking was defined as having four or more drinks in one sitting for women and five or more drinks in one sitting for men.      The mean age of participants was 22.3 years. Almost 60% were women, and almost two thirds (63.3%) were white.      Results showed that 81% of the sample reported engaging in at least one drunkorexia behavior once in the past 3 months.      The analysis also showed that young people living in fraternity or sorority houses were the most likely to engage in negative behaviors surrounding alcohol use. The next most likely group were those living in residence halls, followed by those living off campus, and, finally, those living at home.      Living away from family for the first time and feeling intense stress at school may be contributing factors, said Dr Rinker. But there are other driving forces.      \\"Our data suggest that college students are more likely to engage in these specific compensatory behaviors if they are athletes, are already heavy drinkers, are coping with negative emotions, are engaging in disordered eating practices already, and, most importantly, because they perceive it to be a highly normative behavior among college students.\\"      She said she was surprised that it is not just young women who engage in drunkorexia.      \\"Our study suggested that males are just as likely, if not more likely, to engage in these behaviors. We suspect that this is because men, in general, just tend to engage in riskier drinking behaviors than women.\\"      Drunkorexia can have significant fallout in terms mental and physical health. \\"Engaging in these behaviors is associated with heavier and more problematic drinking and alcohol-related consequences, such as blacking out, getting into fights, passing out, or driving under the influence,\\" said Dr Rinker.      Because the phenomenon has only been studied among college students, researchers do not know whether nonstudents are also engaging in these behaviors.      Clinicians can play a role in reducing or controlling the drunkorexia phenomenon, said Dr Rinker.      \\"They can provide information to college students that indicates that these behaviors are far less normative than they think they are and can encourage students to eat and exercise in a healthy manner.\\"      The research was supported by a grant from the University of Houston and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.      39th Annual Research Society on Alcoholism Scientific Meeting: Presented June 27, 2016. ||||| “Drunkorexia” is a colloquial term for the practice of skipping meals or exercising heavily before consuming alcohol. The trend isn’t new for college students, with the word “drunkorexia” appearing in news headlines -- and alarming parents -- for a few years now.      But a new study, presented this week at the Research Society on Alcoholism’s annual meeting, suggests the behavior may be more common than previously thought, and is an issue for male and female students. Eight out of 10 college students who participated in the study said they had recently engaged in at least one behavior related to drunkorexia.      \\"College students appear to engage in these behaviors to increase alcohol effects or reduce alcohol-related calories by engaging in bulimic-type or diet/exercising/calorie-restricted eating behaviors,\\" Dipali Rinker, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Houston and author of the study, said in a statement. \\"Our information examines the association between these different types of drunkorexic behaviors and other predictors of problem drinking among college students, such as gender differences.\\"      Rinker’s study was based on a survey that included responses from 1,184 college students, most of them from the University of Houston, who had drunk heavily at least once in the past 30 days. More than 80 percent of the students said they had engaged in at least one behavior in the last three months that Rinker considered to be related to drunkorexia.      The behaviors included inducing vomiting, consuming laxatives or diuretics, or not eating anything before drinking.      “Long term, it’s not a good idea to skip nutritious meals in order to consume more calories from alcohol,” Aaron White, the program director of college and underage drinking prevention at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said. “Then there are the short-term consequences. Having food in your stomach reduces peak blood alcohol levels about a third, so if you flip that, your peak level is significantly higher, increasing risk of blackouts, injuries and poor decisions. The consequences are worse than the consequences of not saving the calories.”      It's often students who drink heavily that engage in the behaviors, White added.      \\"We're not talking about someone concerned about a 150-calorie glass of wine,\\" he said. \\"We're talking about someone who is concerned about 1,000 calories from binge drinking, and that's the person you just don't want skipping meals.\\"      Rinker found that students who lived in fraternity and sorority houses were the most likely to report engaging in the behavior, followed by those living in residence halls. Women were more likely to engage in the bulimic-type behaviors than men, according to the study, but both genders were equally likely to engage in some kind of drunkorexic behavior, such as skipping meals.      The new study aimed to expand the definition of drunkorexia, Rinker said, which may explain why earlier research had suggested fewer students engaged in the behavior. Other studies had also suggested there was a sharper gender divide.      A 2009 study found that 50 percent of college women reported restricting food intake before drinking, more than 1.5 times the share of men who reported the behavior. Research also suggests that men and women often have different motivations for engaging in the behavior. A 2014 study, published in the Journal of American College Health, concluded that “women were significantly more likely than men to restrict what they ate prior to alcohol consumption,” and that “this was driven by women’s greater desire to control their weight.”      Nearly 60 percent of female college students responding to a 2012 survey who reported drinking alcohol said they had also engaged in self-induced vomiting. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders states that 72 percent of women who say they abuse alcohol also suffer from an eating disorder.      In 2011, researchers at the University of Missouri at Columbia found that 16 percent of college students responding to a survey reported restricting calories to “save them” for drinking. Women were three times as likely to report engaging in the behavior than men. Male students, on the other hand, were more likely to engage in the behavior to save money for purchasing alcohol.      A study from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that 20 percent of incoming female freshmen responding to a survey said they had engaged in drunkorexic behavior in the last two weeks. Most of them said they did it not for dieting or cost-saving reasons, however.      Instead, they skipped meals because they knew they could get more intoxicated more quickly on an empty stomach.      “We are now aware that this is happening, but there’s still a lot that we just don’t know,” White, of the NIAAA, said. “For instance, how do we prevent it? Students doing this to save calories are different than students doing this to save money or students who are doing it to get as drunk as possible. There’s a lot left to untangle here about what exactly is happening.” |||||","output":"\\"Drunkorexia\\" is a new trend among students in the US, where they deliberately do not eat and go on to drink alcohol in excess, sometimes involving vomiting, consuming laxatives or diuretics, or not eating at all before drinking.

Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country didn't cause the scarcity of fresh water?  Hint: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market...

A downtown area is typically the central business and entertainment district of a city, where many cultural and recreational activities take place. Consequently, a concert hall is more likely to be found in a downtown area to accommodate the population's needs for entertainment and cultural experiences. 2. A university building might have a concert hall or performance space for its music department or students' use, but it is not guaranteed that every university will have a dedicated concert hall. Moreover, a university building's primary purpose is for education and research, not public entertainment. 3. While a theater could host concerts and performances, it is usually designed for theatrical productions, such as plays and musicals, and might not have the proper acoustics and facilities of a dedicated concert hall. 4. A commercial building typically caters to business and retail activities and is less likely to have a concert hall as its primary purpose unless it is specifically designed for entertainment purposes. 5.

When a cold front moves over a land region that has warm, moist air, a transfer of energy occurs. Cold air sinks and pushes warmer air upward. As energy is removed from the air, which change will most likely take place?","output":"When a cold front moves over a land region that has warm, moist air, an energy transfer occurs as the cold air mass forces the warm air mass upward. The cold air, being denser and heavier, sinks and pushes the warm, moist air up along the frontal boundary, leading to a change in the atmospheric conditions. As energy is removed from the air due to the interaction between these two air masses, several significant changes are most likely to take place: 1. Decrease in temperature: As the cold air mass moves in and displaces the warm air mass, the temperature of the region will decrease. This temperature drop is because cold air contains less energy compared to the warm air, leading to an overall decrease in the temperature of the region. 2. Condensation and cloud formation: As the warm air mass containing moisture is pushed upward, it encounters cooler temperatures in the higher altitudes. This cooling of the air leads to condensation, turning the water vapor in the air into water droplets or ice crystals, resulting in the formation of clouds. The kind of clouds formed along the cold front are typically cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds, which are associated with heavy precipitation and thunderstorms. 3. Increase in precipitation: With the cloud formation, there's an increased likelihood of precipitation such as rain, snow, or hail, depending on the temperature and air pressure conditions of the region. The intensity of the precipitation can vary from light showers to heavy rainfall and snowstorms. 4. Change in wind patterns: The interaction between the cold and warm air masses can cause a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds might increase and change direction as the cold front moves across the land region. In some cases, the wind direction shift can be sudden and dramatic, causing cold fronts to be associated with gusty and sometimes damaging winds. 5. Drop in air pressure: As warm air rises and cold air sinks, air pressure usually decreases along the frontal boundary. This drop in air pressure is responsible for the unsettled weather that is typically associated with the passage of a cold front. 6. Clearing skies after the front passes: After the cold front has moved across the region, the skies typically clear as the cool, dry air mass behind the front tends to stabilize the atmosphere and suppress further cloud formation. This leads to more favorable weather conditions following the passage of the cold front, with a decrease in humidity and more comfortable temperatures. Overall, the passage of a cold front over a land region with warm, moist air promotes energy transfer, leading to changes in temperature, cloud formation, precipitation, wind patterns, and air pressure. These changes are responsible for the unsettled and sometimes severe weather conditions that are typically associated with cold fronts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: who played the female lead in the 1933 film king kong?","output":"The female lead in the 1933 classic film \\"King Kong\\" was played by American actress Fay Wray. Born on September 15, 1907, in Alberta, Canada, Vina Fay Wray was a prominent actress in the Hollywood landscape during the 1920s and 1930s. She is best remembered for her role as Ann Darrow, the character famously kidnapped by the gigantic ape, King Kong. \\"King Kong\\" was directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack and produced by David O. Selznick. The film is a landmark piece of cinema history, not only because of its captivating storyline but also due to its innovative special effects and pioneering stop-motion animation techniques by the talented Willis H. O'Brien. In the film, Fay Wray's character, Ann Darrow, is an aspiring actress who finds herself accompanying filmmaker Carl Denham (played by Robert Armstrong) on an expedition to the mysterious Skull Island. Once there, she is captured by the island's natives and offered as a sacrifice to the colossal ape, King Kong. Kong becomes infatuated with Ann and protects her from various perils on the island while forming a bond with her. With the help of a heroic sailor named Jack Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot), Ann is rescued from the clutches of Kong, who is eventually captured and brought to New York City for display. Escaping confinement, King Kong goes on a rampage, ultimately scaling the Empire State Building with Ann in tow. The climactic scene features a squadron of biplanes attacking Kong in a futile effort to rescue Ann; tragically, Kong is finally defeated, illustrating the iconic line, \\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\" Fay Wray went on to have an illustrious acting career, appearing in more than 120 films and television productions, including titles such as \\"The Vampire Bat\\" (1933), \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" (1932), and \\"Mystery of the Wax Museum\\" (1933). Despite her extensive filmography, Wray remains synonymous with her role in \\"King Kong\\" and continues to be celebrated as one of the leading actresses of her era. Wray passed away on August 8, 2004, at the age of 96, leaving behind a legacy that forever changed the course of film history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Liz Lynne, who succeeded Smith as MP for Rochdale, allegedly ordered her PA to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile. They detailed a litany of abuse at the Knowl View children’s home in Rochdale, which closed in the mid-1990s.

Curry powder also doubles as a medicine and has a slightly lower concentration of maca, encouraging female hormones to do the same. Any of these ingredients can be used liberally to help you to reap the benefits of maca powder, including maintaining a healthy body. (2). Maca does not have a discernible effect upon male and female hormones, but it increases both testosterone and inflammatory hormone levels, which promote male libido. Maca is available in powder form. (3). It can also be taken to enhance energy. Recognize the different types of maca. (4). Maca is commonly used in humans to challenge adolescent sexual urges, stimulate hormonal balance, and increase sex drive. Maca powder reduces inflammatory response associated with sexual response to heat, moisture, or stress.","output":"Alright, little buddy, let me explain it to you.

Read this article and answer this question The Burmese too had begun to assemble their invasion force, starting during their new year celebrations in April 1759, gathering troops from all over Upper Burma, including from recently conquered northern Shan States and Manipur. By late 1759, Alaungpaya had massed a force of 40 regiments  at Yangon. Of the 3000 cavalry, 2000 were Manipuri \\"Cassay Horse\\", who had just been press-ganged into Alaungpaya's service after the Burmese conquest of Manipur in 1758. The Burmese battle plan was to go around the heavily defended Siamese positions along the Three Pagodas Pass-Ayutthaya corridor. They selected a longer but less defended route: Go south to Tenasserim, cross the Tenasserim Hills over to Gulf of Siam, and turn north to Ayutthaya. To that end, the Burmese had assembled a fleet of 300 ships to transport a portion of their troops directly to the Tenasserim coast. Alaungpaya was to lead the invasion personally, and his second son Hsinbyushin was his second-in-command. His first son Naungdawgyi was left to administer the country.  Also in his service were his top generals including the likes of Minkhaung Nawrahta who like all Burmese leadership had plenty of military experience. Some in the court urged him to stay behind and allow Hsinbyushin to lead the operation but the king refused. Which of Alaungpaya's sons was older, Naungdawgyi or Hsinbyushin?","output":"Naungdawgyi is the older son of Alaungpaya.

Given the question: Given the below context:  As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

Once upon a time, in a really big and warm state called Texas, there was a lady named Wendy Davis. She was a very brave and strong woman! Wendy Davis wanted to do something important. She wanted to be a big leader to help other people. Wendy Davis had been a leader before in a smaller group called the Texas State Senate for a few years. She did a very big thing called a \\"filibuster,\\" which is talking for a looong time without stopping. Wendy talked for almost 13 hours to help women and girls have more choices about their bodies!

But does she have what it takes to win over the hearts of Texas women? Will they like her and trust her enough to vote? First, let's look at the good things. Wendy has shown that she is brave, and she's not afraid to fight for what she believes in. Texas women might admire that quality in her. Plus, Wendy Davis has experience helping people by passing good laws when she was in the Texas State Senate. That is a big bonus! However, we owe to also think about what may not be as favorable, kiddo. Wendy Davis has some ideas that the people in Texas may not fully agree on. She needs to be a good listener and understand both men and women to be their leader. Sometimes, people may not like changes, but Wendy needs to show them that her plans are for the better. Hey, change can be tough sometimes, right? So, putting it all together like pieces of a puzzle, Wendy Davis has a big challenge to win the hearts of Texas women.

At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them.

What is the name of the park in whose eastern area at the end of the 19th century was under the local government control of Stretford Urban District?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895. Stretford and Lancashire County Council opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry. In 1969 Pevsner wrote: \\"That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England.\\"The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council... A:","output":"The park referred to in the context is Trafford Park, an industrial park that was originally developed at the end of the 19th century. Located in Greater Manchester, England, its eastern area was once under the local government control of Stretford Urban District, while the western region was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Trafford Park has a rich history of industrial development and has seen numerous changes in local governance and infrastructure. Reflecting its relevance to the growth of surrounding areas, it led to tensions and disputes between the Estates Company (the entity responsible for its development), Stretford Council, and other local authorities over the provision of services and resources. Issues such as electricity supply and road improvements were frequent points of contention throughout the park's early years. Despite the initial resistance to aligning the park with nearby city administrations like Manchester Corporation, the significance of Trafford Park and the Manchester Ship Canal to the region's progress and prosperity is evident. Both entities played a crucial role in supporting and shaping industry in the area, which greatly impacted Stretford's growth. Though Trafford Park's governance has been a subject of dispute and debate throughout its history, its contributions to the local economy and industrial development in Greater Manchester are undeniably significant. Its legacy continues today as a hub of business, innovation, and commerce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face.

Of course, it wasn’t too long ago that the nation’s angst was focused on Goldman Sachs Group and the SEC’s civil suit against the Wall street investment bank. Naturally, the questions arises, who has it worse BP or Goldman? The company behind one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history or the Wall Street investment firm accused of failing to properly disclose details about a mortgage securities deal? BP will likely face more harm from the spill than Goldman will from its Abacus deal. Just look at the pictures. For nearly two months, televisions across the world have been running 24-hour web cams showing millions of gallons of crude oil spewing relentlessly in the blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico, killing wildlife and leaving tar bars on white sandy beaches. This endless reel of environment disaster images may not turn away customers from BP gas pumps (especially if BP keeps its prices lower than competitors), but it certainly hasn’t endeared the company to another important constituent: regulators. BP is the largest operator of offshore oil rigs in the Gulf, and it will need regulatory approve to keep expanding its business here. The British company had planned 10 new offshore projects in the Gulf this year. Its chances for obtaining those permits now look quite slim. President Obama said Monday he was looking for someones a– to kick over the spill, which pundits have said is now a political test of the presidents toughness. The last gigantic oil spill  the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez — occurred 21 years ago, under a less environmentally hawkish administration of George H.W. Bush and before environmental issues had gained mainstream political appeal. But in today’s political environment, lawmakers and/or regulators may be more inclined to impose draconian restrictions on BPs future U.S. business. Then there is the issue of cost. Some estimates have pegged litigation and clean-up costs at 40 billion, which is about three times BP’s annual profit. That is real money, and accounts for more than half of the 74 billion in BP lost markets value since the spill began. By comparison, one estimate has put the cost of a Goldman settlement with the SEC at around 600 million, a mere wrist slap and fraction of the company’s annual earnings. Of course, Goldman has lost about 12 billion in market value since the SEC charges were announced in mid April. But the investment bank’s stock can retrace those losses if the capital and financial markets improve. Much of Goldmans profits are generated from its trading prowess. That will likely remain strong regardless of the outcome of the SEC case. To be sure, Goldmans reputation has been tarnished by the Abacus deal  which at its heart accuses the firm of selling a product that it believed was faulty. But that cant compete with the images of oil drenched pelicans and the underwater geyser that keeps spewing and spewing. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about two big companies, BP and Goldman Sachs, who both had some trouble. BP had a big oil spill in the ocean that hurt animals and the environment, and Goldman Sachs had some problems with the way they handled money. The article thinks that BP has it worse because the oil spill can cause a lot of damage and cost them a lot of money to fix it. It also says that people might not trust BP as much in the future. Goldman Sachs might lose some money and their reputation, but they can still make a lot of money from other parts of their business."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that John Culshaw gave an opportunity to show what he could do?, using the article: Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine., what would be the answer ?

The single, taken from their album \\"Blondes, Brunettes, and Redheads,\\" was produced by Bobby Orlando, the creator/founder of the group, and shared co-writing credits with Clifton \\"Jiggs\\" Chase. The featured vocalists on this single were Tricia Wygal, Debra \\"Debbie\\" Gaynor, and Christina Criscione. Can we infer the following? The song was about 15 years old in 2000","output":"Yes, we can infer that \\"You & Me\\" by The Flirts was approximately 15 years old in 2000. The single was released in 1985, and when we fast forward 15 years from this release year, we arrive at the year 2000. The Flirts, comprised of Tricia Wygal, Debra \\"Debbie\\" Gaynor, and Christina Criscione, created music that spanned a range of emotions and captured the essence of the 1980s synth-pop and Hi-NRG dance genre. Bobby Orlando, the mastermind behind The Flirts, was a prolific producer and songwriter who collaborated with many artists during the '80s and '90s. With Orlando and Clifton \\"Jiggs\\" Chase's contribution to the songwriting for \\"You & Me,\\" The Flirts could deliver a memorable and vibrant performance, which contributed to the success of the single. The album \\"Blondes, Brunettes, and Redheads,\\" from which \\"You & Me\\" was taken, showcases the group's versatility and infectious energy. This collection of songs would have evoked nostalgia and fond memories for fans as they looked back upon the album in the year 2000, 15 years after its original release. In conclusion, it is accurate to infer that \\"You & Me\\" by The Flirts was about 15 years old in the year 2000. Given its release in 1985 as part of the \\"Blondes, Brunettes, and Redheads\\" album, this single remains a testament to the creative collaboration of Bobby Orlando, Clifton \\"Jiggs\\" Chase, and the talented vocalists who made up The Flirts at the time of this release."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the given situation, the person is dissatisfied with the varying size of the cake slices handed out, which indicates an underlying concern for equitable distribution. Let us carefully analyze the provided options to understand why \\"fairness\\" is the most suitable answer. 1. Fairness - This option is the most relevant because it addresses the core problem in the scenario. The person demands equitable treatment when it comes to the distribution of cake slices. A sense of fairness ensures that everyone receives a similar share of something, thereby reducing potential conflicts or dissatisfaction. 2. Candies - While candies are a sweet treat, they do not directly address the person's concern in this situation. The issue is not with the presence of additional treats, but with the unequal distribution of the cake slices. 3. Compliments - Compliments do not resolve the problem at hand. Although they might make the person feel better momentarily, the primary issue of unequal cake distribution persists. 4. Well fed - The term \\"well fed\\" indicates that people are adequately nourished and satisfied with their food consumption. However, it does not address the specific issue of unequal cake distribution. Instead, it focuses on the general state of being content with one's food intake. 5. Arguments - Demanding more arguments in this situation is counterproductive. Arguing does not result in a resolution or address the person's unhappiness with the unequal cake slices. On the contrary, it may escalate tensions and create an uncomfortable atmosphere. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"fairness\\" as the answer to the question because it directly tackles the problem in the scenario - the varying size of cake slices handed out. By demanding fairness, the person seeks a solution that ensures an equitable distribution of cake, promoting harmony and satisfaction among everyone present.

Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

Problem:However  it is not yet clear how any female bias will affect overall loggerhead population numbers  says  Dr. Jacques-Olivier LaloÃ«  a researcher in turtle sex ratios from Swansea University .  He  points out that female turtles may be able to cope with a shortage of males because they are able to store sperm. This means they can go long periods of time without encountering a male and still reproduce regularly. On top of this  males are able to mate with multiple females during one season  meaning there does not necessarily need to be equal numbers of males and females for populations to thrive  says  LaloÃ« .  He  tells Carbon Brief: But  at some point  turtle populations will reach a âtipping pointâ where there will not be enough males for mating to take place as normal and turtle populations could quickly collapse  says  LaloÃ« . However  if global CO2 emissions continue to rise unchecked  as in the RCP8.5 emissions scenario  then this tipping point could happen earlier   LaloÃ«  adds.

Marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction a consumer gains from consuming one more unit of a good or service. Generally, as a person consumes more of a good or service, their marginal utility tends to decrease. This is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. It suggests that the first few units of consumption yield greater satisfaction than the subsequent units. In the case of Greg and David, since Greg is in poverty, an additional unit of a good or service would provide him with greater satisfaction compared to David, who is already wealthy and has access to more resources.

A distraction can even make the pain non-existent for some babies, because before the baby even realizes what is going on, the shot will have already been administered.  You can give your baby a new toy to play with or sing a song to him/her. You can also try telling your baby a funny story or reading him/her a book. Another good distraction for your baby may be cartoons. If your doctor has a TV in the examination room, tune it in to some cartoons. Your baby may become engulfed in the show and may forget why he/she is even there. If your doctor doesn’t have a TV in the examination room, ask your doctor if it is okay for you to bring your own. You can bring in a portable DVD player with your baby’s favorite show or movie. Studies have shown that if you give your baby something sweet to eat right before the vaccination, it will help to ease the pain. This trick can be used on small babies as well, by simply dipping their pacifier in some sugary water. Older babies and toddlers can suck on a lollipop. Try using a skin numbing cream to help reduce the amount of pain your baby will experience. There are a few good creams out there that will help numb the skin and keep the nerves from releasing pain signals to your baby’s brain. Make sure that you apply the cream approximately one hour before the procedure to make sure it has time to work. Check with your doctor about which cream is recommended for your baby. Your baby will feed off of your energy and if you are overly stressed then your baby will be stressed also.  It is not necessary to try to explain to your baby that the shot is necessary, because your baby will not understand any of what you are saying in that moment. If your baby starts protesting the shot, it is important that you stand firm and remain calm. Never become angry with your baby and always speak in a calm, soothing tone.","output":"The given text discusses various methods to make vaccinations easier and less painful for babies. One of the most common and effective techniques discussed is using distractions to divert the baby's attention away from the pain. Examples of distractions include giving the baby a new toy, singing a song, telling a funny story, reading a book, or watching cartoons. If the doctor's examination room has a TV, tuning into cartoons could help the baby to forget their reason for being there. Alternatively, parents can bring a portable DVD player with the baby's favorite show or movie.

Parents should consult with the doctor about which cream is recommended for their baby and apply it an hour before the procedure to ensure it works effectively. The text also highlights the importance of parents being calm during vaccinations, as babies can sense and mimic their parent's stress. It is unnecessary to try explaining the purpose of the shot, since the baby won't understand the situation. If the baby protests, it is crucial for parents to remain firm and calm, avoiding anger and speaking in a soothing tone throughout the process.

After young squire Sir Johan wins in a jousting tournament in his kingdom, his friend Peewit, the kingdom's court jester dwarf, celebrates by singing a victory song, with only one problem; he is so terrible a singer he drives the whole kingdom into hiding (not to mention attracting a powerful thunderstorm), and only Johan was kind enough to escort Peewit back to the castle in the rain.The next morning, a musical instrument merchant arrives in front of the castle to sell instruments to Peewit, but only the nameless King and Johann are present to meet him. After being offered some obnoxious instruments, Johan and the King angrily send off the merchant, who accidentally leaves behind one of the instruments offered - a peculiar flute with only 6 holes! When Peewit almost takes notice, Johann and the King sneak the flute off into the castle to destroy it before he can find it. They throw it in the King's fireplace, but the fire emanates green smoke that permeates the King's room! Peewit is among those who try to put the fire out, and much to the dismay of Johan and the King, he finds the flute in the ashes. But once Peewit cleans the flute and goes around the kingdom playing it, he is delighted to make a surprising discovery; once played, the flute causes anyone who hears it to dance uncontrollably and subsequently pass out from exhaustion. Just as Peewit is enjoying tormenting everyone with this newfound gift, the same merchant as before is offering instruments to the owner of a bar in town. When he is worried to notice (and mentions) that the odd 6-holed flute he had was missing, he is overheard by a shady bearded fat man named Matthew Oilycreep (AKA: Matthew McCreep), who makes inquiries about the flute to the merchant, who recalls that he dropped it at the front of the kingdom while offering it to Peewit.

Published in two versions in 1726, during the Augustan period, its celebration of the individual experience of the landscape makes it a precursor of Romanticism. As a prospect poem, it has been the subject of continuing debate over how far it meets artistic canons. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? John Dyer was influenced by the landscape in his poetry.","output":"Yes, the sentence certainly follows the preceding text. The text details how John Dyer's poem \\"Grongar Hill\\" was a loco-descriptive piece. This means that it was a type of poem that dwells on the particulars of a specific location; in this case, the geographic location of Grongar Hill in Carmarthenshire, Wales. What the poem does is not just describe the setting in accurate geographic details but also convey the poet's subjective response and experience of that landscape — an approach that was later to become a defining characteristic of the Romantic movement in literature. Dyer's focus on the landscape in his poetry, as evidenced in \\"Grongar Hill,\\" suggests a deep appreciation for and connection with nature. This is indicative of some form of influence the physical environment had on his work. The way Dyer brings to life the landscape and interweaves it with his own feelings and sensibilities implies that the landscape held a significant place in his creative process.  Moreover, the text acknowledges that Dyer's poem preceded the Romantic period, an era known for its profound emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature. The deep emotional resonance that Dyer's poem gives to a specific landscape — Grongar Hill — demonstrates how the surroundings could affect him emotionally, shaping his poetic vision, and thereby influencing his work. Additionally, the text further alludes to the debates over how well the poem accomplishes the standards of prospect poetry. Prospect poetry, another genre where landscape plays a critical role, further supports the claim that Dyer was influenced by the landscape in his poetry. Though the nature of influence may differ — with spectator-like observation in prospect poetry vs. active emotional engagement in Romanticism — the constant variable here is the undeniable role played by the physical environment in influencing Dyer's poetry. In conclusion, the sentence that John Dyer was influenced by the landscape in his poetry does indeed follow and align with the preceding text. His work, \\"Grongar Hill,\\" is exemplary of a poet deeply touched by the vista of a physical realm, and through his verses, he transmits this appreciation onto his readers, further enhancing the acknowledgment of landscape's influence in his poetry. It is perhaps not just the physical reality of the landscape, but also its interconnections with human experiences and emotions that constituted his poems, indicating a considerable influence of the landscape on his poetry."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Make an effort to eat less than you’re currently eating. Reduce your daily calorie intake gradually for the first week or so, then stick with an approximate amount that will allow you to lose weight without leaving you feeling totally wiped out. Counting calories isn’t a lot of fun, and it definitely requires discipline in the long run, but it’s a surefire way to achieve a leaner physique.  The most elementary rule of dieting is that if you burn more calories than you consume, you’ll lose weight. Consult with a nutritionist, keep a food journal or use a calorie-counting app like MyFitnessPal to track the nutritional value of the food you eat and calculate how many calories you need to keep making progress. In order to keep your calorie intake low, the first things you should eliminate from your diet are salty, sugary, overly-processed foods and snacks. Say goodbye to French fries, pizza, cake and candy. Sweets and fatty foods contain more concentrated doses of calories per serving size, which means you can eat them in the same portions as other healthier foods and still gain weight. Junk food is a death trap for those seeking to lower their body fat percentage.  The food you eat should be grilled, baked, broiled or steamed. Stay away from fatty additives like butter and oil. One simple way to drastically reduce the number of calories you’re getting is to stop eating fast food and drinking soda. This allows most people to lose an additional 2-3 pounds a week. Low-calorie, filling food are key to your success. 400 calories of vegetables will fill you to the brim while 400 calories of oil or fried chicken will leave you wanting more. Know what to eat to trick your body into telling you it's finished. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats are all low-calorie dense foods that will help you lose weight. Fruits and veggies are mostly water-based and contain very few calories and very little fat--on the other hand, 1 g of fat is nine calories in itself. So stay away from processed goods and go green. And red, orange, blue, and yellow. Fiber is great for you, too, and only has 1.5-2.5 calories per gram. Most legumes, nuts, and seeds are excellent sources of this. 4 oz of lean chicken is good for you...until you slather it with butter and Colby-Jack.  When preparing meat, take the skin off and trim the fat. And don't coat it in bread crumbs or other unnecessary additives. Don’t deep fry any food. Even if it's a vegetable; it loses its nutritional value when fried. Steam your food instead and add lots of spice. Steaming your food instead of frying it will cut down on fat and calories, and spices will spike your metabolism. Starving yourself is not the key to losing fat -- it's choosing the right foods that will burn the fat for you. Throw out the junk in your pantry and stock up on the good stuff:  Fatty fish high in omega-3s help reduce the levels of leptin in your body. And that guy keeps hunger at bay and ups your metabolism. If you're not a seafood fan, talk to your doctor about taking fish oil supplements. Not as good as the natural thing, but still beneficial.  An apple a day keeps the fat at bay. Apples are full of pectin, which reduces the amount of fat your body absorbs. They're also fiber-full and calorie-low, so they're really the perfect snack. Did we mention delicious? Add ginger and garlic to your meals. Ginger widens your blood vessels, garlic lowers your insulin levels, and both increase your metabolic rate. Use olive oil as your primary cooking oil. Even though oil is fat, olive oil is full of the good kind (monounsaturated) that helps lower cholesterol levels, and has many other health benefits, too. Water is the breath of life and of weight loss. Minimize your appetite (and clear your skin!) by drinking morning, noon, and night.  Drink two glasses of water before every meal. You will feel fuller faster (say that three times fast) and not have room for more calories. While each person's hydration needs are different, the Institute of Medicine advises that men and women try to consume about 3.7 and 2.7 liters of water a day, respectively, including water found in food and other beverages .  Green tea is a good idea, too. It's loaded with antioxidants and may help increase your metabolic rate.  Whatever you do, cut out the sodas and alcohol. They're just empty calories that pack on the pounds silently without even making you feel full. Eating 5 to 7 small meals a day leads to quicker weight loss than any other meal routine. You will feel fuller all day, removing the urge to overeat.  Keep your snacks healthy. Measure out portions of your favorite healthy snacks (carrots, grapes, nuts, or yogurt) and package them for easy access throughout the week. Instead of working all day, you'll be working and snacking, keeping your metabolism up. Don't skip breakfast! Your body needs that kick in the morning to get reminded to get going. Not only will you be more likely to lose weight, you'll probably keep it off too .","output":"The article focuses on strategies for losing weight by reducing calorie intake, making healthier food choices, increasing metabolism through certain foods and spices, staying hydrated, and maintaining a consistent meal schedule."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dame Louise Casey accused public bodies of ignoring or condoning divisive or harmful religious practices for fear of being called racist. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said he would study the findings \\"closely\\". Dame Louise's review into the integration of minorities was commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron as part of the government's efforts to tackle extremism. Among her recommendations were that immigrants could take \\"an oath of integration with British values and society\\" and schoolchildren be taught British values. Her review said there was a sense that people from different backgrounds got on well together at a general level, but community cohesion \\"did not feel universally strong across the country\\". She found \\"high levels of social and economic isolation in some places, and cultural and religious practices in communities that are not only holding some of our citizens back, but run contrary to British values and sometimes our laws\\". Her report highlighted the plight of women in some Muslim communities, who she said were less likely to speak English and more likely to be kept at home. \\"Misogyny and patriarchy has to come to an end,\\" Dame Louise said, adding that public institutions must not fear being branded racist or Islamophobic. Faeeza Vaid, from the Muslim Women's Network, said migrant communities should not be blamed for failing to integrate. \\"We also see segregated white communities,\\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \\"Integration is everyone's responsibility.\\" Halima Begum, a Muslim woman from London, said she was \\"worried\\" that the report singled out Muslim men. \\"There is a problem with men and I see it,\\" she told the BBC's Asian Network. \\"We need to have an open debate without placing too much blame on communities.\\" Afraid of being dubbed racist, afraid of losing support, afraid of challenging minority communities - that is Dame Louise Casey's view of Britain's decision-makers. Criticising politicians and officials is the easy bit. The significance of this report is that it targets individual communities and faiths. It contrasts with the language of people living \\"parallel lives\\" - a term used in an earlier report and designed to be neutral, placing no more blame on one community than another. Dame Louise makes clear her outrage at what she calls \\"regressive practices\\" targeting women and girls. She accepts she is putting Muslim areas under the spotlight. The question for Dame Louise - an official not immune to criticism herself - is how would she achieve change? What if an elected politician refused to take her oath? What if some people - of whatever community - simply prefer to live and educate their children separately? Iqbal Bhana, a government adviser on anti-Muslim hate crime, rejected the report's claim that Britain was becoming more segregated. \\"I don't think we are divided,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"If you go to places like Bradford or Leicester you see second and third-generation people moving out of some of these communities.\\" During her research, Dame Louise spoke to women in areas of Birmingham and Manchester that she said could not leave their homes without their husband's permission. She blamed those in authority for \\"ducking the issue\\" of women's inequality out of a wish to respect different cultures. 4.1m population increase 2001-11 50%+ of the increase is due to immigration 2.8m people in Britain are Muslim - the biggest religious group after Christians 70-85% of the populations in some wards in Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford are Muslim 511 schools in 43 areas take more than 50% pupils from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds 27% of births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK \\"If [the women] were white and living in Surrey, we would all be up in arms about it,\\" she said. She said not talking about these issues would only \\"give ammunition to the extreme far-right and Islamic extremists\\", who are the people \\"who set out to divide us\\". Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on social integration, agreed that division had bred extremism and was \\"sapping our communities of trust\\". Immigration was another theme in the report, in which Dame Louise said some towns and cities were \\"struggling to adjust\\" to an influx of foreign nationals. On a visit to Sheffield, she said, she had found some schools were coping with an increase in Eastern European children from 150 to nearly 2,500 over a five-year period. The report also highlighted a \\"persistent disadvantage\\" facing black men in the workplace, as well as white working class children on free meals who underperformed at school. The report made 12 recommendations, including: Mr Javid said Britain had \\"long been home to lots of different cultures and communities\\", but added that \\"all of us have to be part of one society\\". While it was right to celebrate the \\"positive contribution\\" diverse groups make to British life, nobody should be excluded from it or left behind, he said. \\"We need to take a serious look at the facts and must not shy away from the challenges we face. \\"Dame Louise's report is a valuable contribution, and I will be studying her findings closely.\\" He said he would be reporting back in the New Year.

In 1683, the Holy League of Austria, Poland, Venice, and  Russia was formed to oppose the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe. The defeat and the chaotic situation within the Ottoman Empire created widespread social disruption in the Central Balkans, particularly in the regions of Skopje and Niš, where Karposh's rebellion originated. On 25 October 1689, the Austrian branch of the Holy League, led by General Piccolomini, reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants of the villages there. The same day, Piccolomini began a withdrawal of his forces, and on October 26, set fire to the city. Skopje burned for two whole days, through the 26th and 27 October. Most of the city of Skopje was destroyed in the fire. Some accounts of these events state that Piccolomini razed Skopje due to an inability of his forces to occupy and govern a city so far from his headquarters, while other accounts state that it was perpetrated to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many years passed between the Battle of Vienna and the Austrian branch of the Holy League reached the Plain of Skopje?","output":"To determine the number of years that passed between the Battle of Vienna and the arrival of the Austrian branch of the Holy League at the Plain of Skopje, follow these steps: 1.

Do virtual particles and energy in vacuum really exist? How do we know if they exist if we can't observe them? Where are they? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Possible answers: A). no B). yes","output":"To answer your questions, let's go through them step-by-step and provide justifications for each step. 1. Are vacuum fluctuations an energy in a vacuum? Are these virtual particles? Step 1: Define vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles. Vacuum fluctuations refer to the temporary changes in energy that occur in empty space due to the principles of quantum mechanics. Virtual particles, on the other hand, are short-lived particles that form spontaneously in a vacuum as a result of these fluctuations. Step 2: Connect vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles. Since vacuum fluctuations cause the creation of virtual particles, we can conclude that they are energy in a vacuum. 2. How do we know there is this energy if virtual particles didn't exist? Do they really exist? Step 1: Discuss evidence for virtual particles. Although virtual particles are difficult to observe directly, their existence has been inferred through their effects on measurable quantities, such as the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift. Step 2: Conclude on the existence of virtual particles. Based on this indirect evidence, we can argue that virtual particles exist. 3. Do virtual particles and energy in vacuum really exist? How do we know if they exist if we can't observe them? Where are they? Step 1: Reiterate the existence of virtual particles and vacuum energy. As stated earlier, the existence of virtual particles and vacuum energy has been inferred from their indirect effects on measurable quantities. Step 2: Explain the difficulty in direct observation. Direct observation of virtual particles is challenging because they are short-lived and only exist for a brief period. Step 3: Describe the location of virtual particles. Virtual particles are present throughout the vacuum of space since vacuum fluctuations occur everywhere. 4. Are the questions the same? Comparing the content of the questions, they are related but not the same. The first and second questions inquire about the vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles, while the third question delves more deeply into the existence and observation of virtual particles and vacuum energy.

(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has upheld an obstruction of justice conviction against Barry Bonds, according to court documents released Friday. The court ruled that the evasiveness of the testimony the former baseball star gave to a grand jury investigating sales of performance-enhancing drugs was sufficient to convict him.  In an opinion filed by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Mary M. Schroeder said the three-judge panel rejected Bonds' contention that he could only have been indicted for obstruction if his testimony had been flatly false. Attorneys for Bonds had argued that Bonds' statements to the grand jury were factually true, and that language in the federal statute under which he was charged is unconstitutionally vague.  The appeals court rejected that argument.  \\"When factually true statements are misleading or evasive, they can prevent the grand jury from obtaining truthful and responsive answers,\\" Schroeder wrote. \\"They may therefore obstruct and impede the administration of justice within the meaning of the federal criminal statute.\\"  Bonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of an investigation that targeted his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, and employees of the California drug testing laboratory known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or BALCO.  The testimony that led to Bonds' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds whether Anderson ever gave him \\"anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with.\\"  Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors \\"ever touch me,\\" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson.  1.

We have 4 times some number (q) equal to -8 times that same number (q). The problem looks like this: 4*q = -8*q.

So, we have: 4*q - 4*q = -8*q - 4*q This simplifies to: 0 = -12*q Now, we want to find what q is, so we will divide both sides of the equation by -12: 0 ÷ -12 = (-12*q) ÷ -12 This leaves us with: 0 = q So, the answer is q = 0.

The passengers were evacuated and taken on to the French terminal. Long delays and queues continued all day. The broken down train reached France at 17:15 BST where passengers were reunited with their cars. A spokesman for Eurotunnel said services should run normally on Tuesday. There were also delays on Eurostar passenger services, with delays and cancellations on trains between London St Pancras and Paris and Brussels. Eurotunnel said a fault with the overhead power lines in the tunnel caused the problem. The driver brought the train, which carries people through the Channel Tunnel in their cars, to a stop and passengers were evacuated into the middle service tunnel, which runs between the two main tunnels and is designed to allow people to escape from halted trains. A train was brought from France along the other main tunnel and parked alongside the stopped train to allow passengers to board it and be carried to France without their cars. Passenger Richard Byrom, from Maidstone, told BBC Radio Kent: \\"All of a sudden I heard this crashing noise, it didn't sound like the train itself had crashed but what became evident later on was that the power cables had got entangled or come down. \\"For about 20 minutes the train just stopped and we didn't know what had happened. \\"Eventually they said they are going to take us off the train because they couldn't move our train because it was trapped by the power cables or something like that.\\" He said the passengers had to wait in the service tunnel for about half an hour before boarding the train that took them to France and he had been stuck for about four hours in total. He said they were given an evacuation pack of a pen, notepad, playing cards, torch, fan, water and wet wipes. Another passenger, Brian Tait from Dover, said earlier the process had been \\"civilised\\" but added: \\"Communication has been bad, we have not heard when we will get our car back, it's all been word of mouth.\\" Luke Chaplin, who said he was starting a holiday with his wife that was a wedding present, said: \\"We've been given water and a sandwich, just one sandwich. Nobody has said anything about compensation.\\" Dean Bacon, from Bewdleyin Worcestershire, said: \\"This unfortunate incident has led to a total shambles, highlighting extremely poor evacuation methods and equipment. \\"After the incident happened it took four-and-a-half hours before we got out of the tunnel. \\"The evacuation train was a basic freight train and did not have any facility to cater if there was anyone with any injuries.\\" He said things had been \\"extremely difficult\\" for families with young children. \\"There were dogs barking, old people who had to stand for long periods with no clear evacuation plan,\\" he added. The train was only about seven miles into its 30 mile tunnel route when it stopped and the spokesman said it would have been quicker to tow it back to Kent but the company chose to take it to France so passengers could be reunited with their cars. Eurotunnel continued to run Le Shuttle services in the one unblocked tunnel with trains running in one direction for 90 minutes and then in the opposite direction for 90 minutes. The firm said there was a waiting time of about three hours at the terminal. Eurostar, which operates passenger trains through the tunnel running between London and Paris and Brussels, cancelled a number of services in each direction and warned passengers on trains that were running to expect delays. There had been concern the delays would affect the Tour de France with teams heading to France after finishing the third stage in London but cyclists flew to France on Monday evening on four chartered planes from London City Airport. P&O Ferries was preparing to transport the Tour's entourage earlier. The fourth stage is set to begin in Le Touquet on Tuesday. Brian Rees, from the ferry company, said: \\"We've got something like 1,100 Tour vehicles coming through the course of the afternoon and into the evening.\\" Michael and Catherine Pike, from south-east London, said they had been stranded in a car park in Calais for about three hours. Mrs Pike, 80, said: \\"We were hoping to catch a ferry but haven't heard a peep out of anybody at all. \\"There is food but nobody says a word.\\" Eurotunnel apologised for the delays and said it had tried to keep customers moving. Eurostar said four trains would be cancelled on Tuesday morning. In a statement, Eurostar said: \\"Eurotunnel engineers are working to resolve the issues and restore full power to the affected section of the Tunnel. \\"The latest operational update from Eurotunnel suggests that these works will continue until 06:00 BST on Tuesday 8 July, when the Tunnel will partially reopen. As a consequence of the ongoing loss of power, Eurotunnel has informed Eurostar that some further disruption should be expected to services tomorrow morning.\\" Summary:","output":"A train called Le Shuttle had a problem and stopped in a big tunnel between England and France. There were 382 people on the train, and they all had to get off and wait for another train to come and take them the rest of the way to France. This made a lot of people have to wait a long time for their turn to go through the tunnel. Some people were also worried they wouldn't get their cars back right away. The company that runs the train said a problem with the power lines was the reason the train stopped. They said they are sorry for the trouble and are working to fix it so the trains can run properly again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sinclair, from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, had been on trial at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court. He will appeal against the conviction. District Judge David Parsons said the offence had \\"enormous\\" potential to deter other victims from coming forward. The prosecution claimed during his trial last month that by including details of the relationship between the victim and defendant in a court report about a man convicted of voyeurism, along with other details, the article contained enough information to allow the public to make a jigsaw identification of the woman. Judge Parsons said the defendant in the case lived in a small village and when \\"coupled with local knowledge\\", work colleagues, friends, relatives and acquaintances, could have identified her after reading the article. Finding Sinclair guilty, the judge said: \\"The protection of victims of sexual offences is a matter of considerable concern. \\"This court must be mindful of the real psychological harm to the victim, harm confirmed by this victim in her victim impact statement.\\" The court heard Sinclair accepted publishing the story but denied it was likely to lead to the woman's identification and said she would not have known about the article had it not been for his prosecution. In a statement read out in court, the victim said she had been told before the sex offence trial that her details would not be made public. She said: \\"Finding out about the article has set me back and means the stress of this case is not over as it means there is now another court case involving me.\\" During his trial in April, Matthew Paul, defending Sinclair, said there was little risk of the victim being identified because only around 0.68% of the county's population - or about 450 people - read the paper. At Friday's sentencing hearing, he said circulation had increased to 3,200 but advertising revenue had been \\"dented\\" by \\"the running of the defence in this case\\". Mr Paul added: \\"It is regretted by Mr Sinclair that this slipped through the net. He did not himself have any particular role in reading it ... he skim read it at best.\\" Sinclair was fined £1,500 and ordered to pay the victim £1,500 compensation, costs of £500 and a surcharge of £150. After the hearing, he vowed to appeal against both the conviction and sentence. This article was about:","output":"Okay, little buddy. So, Thomas Sinclair is a man who owns a newspaper called the Ceredigion Herald. He got in trouble because his newspaper published some information that it shouldn't have. You see, when someone is a victim in a special kind of crime called a \\"sexual offense,\\" they have a right to keep their identity a secret. But Thomas Sinclair's newspaper shared enough details that people could figure out who the victim was. This is not good because it can make the victim feel bad or scared. Thomas got found guilty in court, which means a judge said he did something wrong. He has to pay some money as a punishment and to help the victim feel better. But Thomas doesn't agree with the judge, so he says he's going to appeal, which means he'll ask another group of judges to look at his case and see if they agree or maybe change the decision.

Information:  - The British Antarctic Expedition 190709, otherwise known as the Nimrod Expedition, was the first of three expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton. Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the South Pole. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a Farthest South latitude of 88° 23' S, just from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole. A separate group led by Welsh Australian geology professor Edgeworth David reached the estimated location of the South Magnetic Pole, and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of Mount Erebus, Antarctica's second highest volcano.  - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland. It is near the mouth of the River Nith into the Solway Firth. Dumfries was a civil parish and became the county town of the former county of Dumfriesshire. Dumfries is nicknamed \\"Queen of the South\\". People from Dumfries are known colloquially as \\"Doonhamers\\".  - The Solway Firth is a firth that forms part of the border between England and Scotland, between Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) and Dumfries and Galloway. It stretches from St Bees Head, just south of Whitehaven in Cumbria, to the Mull of Galloway, on the western end of Dumfries and Galloway. The Isle of Man is also very near to the firth. The firth comprises part of the Irish Sea.  - Arrol - Aster was a British car maker founded in 1927 when Arrol - Johnston and Aster merged . The Wembley , London works of Aster was closed and production concentrated at the Heathhall , Dumfries factory of Arrol - Johnston . At first , manufacture of all the cars previously made by the two companies was continued along with those made under the Galloway badge but in 1928 a rationalisation was carried out . The cars were complex and expensive and sales were poor resulting in the company going into receivership in 1929 and finally closing in 1931 . The company was responsible for making the body for Sir Malcolm Campbell 's Blue Bird car in 1929 and an Arrol - Aster car was entered in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans .  - Arrol-Johnston (later known as Arrol-Aster) was an early Scottish manufacturer of automobiles, which operated from 1896 to 1931 and produced the first automobile manufactured in Britain. The company also developed the world's first \\"off-road\\" vehicle for the Egyptian government, and another designed to travel on ice and snow for Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole.  - A royal burgh was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter. Although abolished in law in 1975, the term is still used by many former royal burghs.  - Dumfriesshire or the County of Dumfries (\\"Siorrachd Dhùn Phris\\" in Gaelic) is lieutenancy area and historic county of Scotland.  - The River Nith is a river in South West Scotland.  - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries.  - Market town or market right is a legal term, originating in the Middle Ages, for a European settlement that has the right to host markets, distinguishing it from a village and city. A town may be correctly described as a \\"market town\\" or as having \\"market rights\\", even if it no longer holds a market, provided the legal right to do so still exists.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire.

Article: INDIO, CA - Trial proceedings were expected to get underway starting Monday for an Indio man accused of murdering his girlfriend and dumping her body at an Indio golf course.      Michael John Franco, 45, faces life without the possibility of parole for the alleged murder of Jill Grant, 41, a popular Palm Desert High School math teacher whose body was found at the Golf Club at Terra Lago in the early morning hours of Dec. 23, 2013.      In addition to murder, Franco faces special circumstance allegations of inflicting torture on Grant and committing the murder in the commission of a felony, initially making him eligible for the death penalty. In August 2015, prosecutors decided not to pursue capital punishment against him.      Franco also faces one felony count each of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm, and sentence-enhancing allegations of using a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony.      Grant's body was found by golf course employees, who told Indio police that an SUV sped off from the scene, leaving tire marks along the course.      Grant was found with numerous injuries; the criminal complaint lists a Toyota Prius and a box cutter as weapons used in the killing.      Investigators said a search conducted the following day at Grant's residence in the 84-400 block of Onda Drive in Indio revealed blood on several items throughout the house and shoe prints consistent with impressions found at the crime scene, according to court records.      Franco was taken into custody on Dec. 24, 2013 in Palm Desert. Police said in court documents that Franco had to be Tased before being taken into custody following \\"a short scuffle\\" and told police that he was trying to get to Mexico before they caught him.      Franco remains held in lieu of 5 million bail.

Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \\"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\\" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \\"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \\"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: \\"Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed\\".As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel...

Deal with pests.\\"","output":"Title: Orchid Care: Reviving Your Non-Blooming Plant, Rejuvenating Limp Leaves, and Overcoming Pests Introduction Orchids are renowned for their alluring beauty and exquisite blooms. However, even the most experienced gardeners can face challenges when it comes to maintaining these plants. Understanding the intricacies of orchid care will not only help you deal with non-blooming plants, limp leaves, and pests but also ensure your orchids thrive and bloom year after year. In this article, we will discuss how to: 1. Deal with an orchid that won't bloom. 2. Care for an orchid with limp leaves. 3. Overcome common orchid pests.   Dealing with an Orchid That Won't Bloom 1.1: Correct Amount of Light One common reason an orchid may not bloom is inadequate light. To thrive, most orchids require bright, yet indirect sunlight. Morning and early afternoon sunlight is often best, so placing them near east or south-facing windows may be ideal. If your orchid hasn't produced blossoms in some time, consider moving it to an area where it will receive more natural lighting. 1.2: Optimal Temperature Inconsistent or inappropriate temperature is another factor that hinders orchid blooming. Maintain daytime temperatures around 70 to 75°F (21 to 24°C) and night temperatures between 60 to 65°F (15 to 18°C). Most orchids require a 10°F (5°C) drop in temperature at night for the plant to initiate spikes for blooming. 1.3: Proper Watering and Humidity Orchids need the right balance of water and humidity to bloom. Water your orchid once a week, allowing the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings. Use purified water or rainwater, if possible, because tap water often contains minerals that can harm your plant. Mist the leaves and surrounding air to maintain adequate humidity, especially during dry months. 1.4: Fertilize Regularly Fertilization plays a key role in promoting blossoms. Use a balanced orchid fertilizer monthly during the growing season and reduce the frequency to every six weeks during the winter. Look for a fertilizer specifically designed for orchids and follow the instructions carefully to avoid overfeeding. 1.5: Regular Re-potting Over time, the potting medium breaks down, suffocating the orchid's roots. Re-pot your orchid every 18 to 24 months with a fresh orchid mix. This will promote better root growth and encourage future blooms. Caring for an Orchid with Limp Leaves 2.1: Hydration or Over-watering Limp leaves are common indicators of dehydration or over-watering. If the leaves appear wrinkled and the potting medium is dry, increase your watering frequency. Conversely, if the potting medium remains wet and soggy, reduce watering to prevent root rot. 2.2: Temperature Stress Avoid exposing your orchids to extreme temperatures, as this may also cause limp leaves. Make sure your orchid does not experience temperature fluctuations and is placed in a consistent environment. 2.3: Nutrient Imbalance Poor nutrition can cause limp leaves as well. Incorporate a balanced orchid fertilizer into your care routine to provide essential nutrients. Avoid fertilizing weak or stressed plants, as it could further exacerbate the issue. Dealing with Pests 3.1: Identifying Common Pests Orchids are prone to various pests, such as mealybugs, spider mites, scale insects, and aphids. Regularly inspect your plant for these pests, particularly the underside of leaves and joints. 3.2: Preventive Measures To avoid a pest infestation, maintain cleanliness in your plant's environment. Keep the foliage dust-free, discard dead plant matter, and ensure the potting medium is changed as required. 3.3: Pest Management Small infestations can be handled by wiping the affected areas with a cotton swab dipped in 70% isopropyl alcohol. For larger infestations, follow the directions for the appropriate insecticide or oil-based spray to eliminate the pests. Conclusion Orchid care can be complex, requiring a delicate balance of light, temperature, water, and nutrition. By identifying and addressing potential issues, you can enjoy years of stunning blooms in your home or garden. Remember to maintain a clean and healthy environment for your plants to prevent pests, and share your success with friends or family by gifting them an exquisite orchid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Catholic Church sex abuse report names hundreds of priests, accuses leaders of cover-up: 'They hid it all.' Aug 14      Left: A photo of Michael Jackson’s nephew, singer T.J. Jackson, which federal authorities say David Milliner of Philadelphia used as a profile shot on social media accounts he set up under the name His Royal Highness Daniel David DeRothschild. Right: David Milliner’s mugshot after his arrest earlier this year by Philadelphia Police.      Last year, an obscure publication, Rich and Royal Magazine, began posting breathless Facebook updates tracking every move of a man it described as the latest European royal to cause a splash in America’s celebrity social scene.      Prince Daniel David DeRothschild’s August 2017 visit to Michael Jackson’s grave in Glendale, Calif., drew a line of paparazzi stretching two city blocks, magazine correspondent Ashton Alton Quartermaine III posted. His charisma, “vast American holdings,” and extensive charity work had – according to Quartermaine’s retelling – left much of the city musing: “Who [is] this man who seems to captivate everyone who comes into his presence?”      But that man was no prince. In fact, he never existed at all.      Instead, federal authorities say, DeRothschild, Quartermaine, and even the magazine were social-media fabrications dreamed up by an unemployed North Philadelphia man engaged in an elaborate catfishing scheme.      Prosecutors say that David Milliner, 49, managed to persuade at least five prepubescent boys he met online to send him explicit photographs of themselves by pretending to be the wealthy European Prince DeRothschild online.      Investigators have linked at least eight Facebook profiles and several other social-media accounts to Milliner posing as DeRothschild or supposed members of the prince’s retinue all designed to further convince his targets of his legitimacy.      Their personas included a made-up chief of security; a head of communications; Quartermaine, the reporter purportedly sent to cover the prince; and DeRothschild’s supposed cousin, the self-described socialite and “son of two fashion houses,” Michael Prada Vuitton.      “He convinced [his victims] that he was rich and famous,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Rotella. “And he would never send them photos of his face.”      Sure, there were signs that would have given a more sophisticated audience pause.      The profile photo Milliner used for DeRothschild on multiple social-media platforms was an image of a Jackson nephew, the singer T.J. Jackson.      And in a December 2016 Facebook post, DeRothschild described himself as the “dolphin of France” – an apparent malapropism for “dauphin,” the term the French once used to refer to the heir apparent in their royal lineage.      Yet for his young and unsuspecting targets, Milliner’s approach proved successful time and again, investigators said.      Between September and November 2017, he allegedly communicated with at least eight boys across the country – the youngest of whom was 6 years old. Many of those relationships lasted for months, according to an indictment unsealed last month.      When Philadelphia police in February finally traced the online activity to Milliner’s 32nd Street rowhouse — where he lived by himself — they found him chatting with yet another underage victim on a social-media video streaming service, they said.      On Thursday, Milliner denied the allegations. With his shoulders slumped and his hands clasped behind his back, he pleaded not guilty to 16 child-pornography offenses during a hearing in federal court in Philadelphia.      The soft voice with which he answered questions from the judge contrasted sharply with the chutzpah evident in his social-media fantasies.      Boasting of himself as an “heir, socialite … humanitarian [and] trillionaire,” the DeRothschild of Milliner’s alleged portrayal led a Zelig-like existence, flitting from one newsworthy moment to another.      He hosted the hottest Hollywood parties – including his “famous” February 2017 “double-mega yacht party” – and counted celebrities including Nicki Minaj, George Clooney, Prince, and Hillary Clinton as “close personal friends.”      As movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s career crumbled under the weight of sexual-misconduct claims, DeRothschild was quick to post a condemnation and demand “resignation letters of all involved.” And last year, he claimed to have attended President Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress.      Before the 2017 Academy Awards, DeRothschild turned to his Facebook page to find an adoring fan to take as his date.      “We will go to every after party and you will be dressed in Marquesa,” Milliner purportedly wrote in the name of his mythical monarch while misspelling Marchesa, the high-end women’s fashion brand. “I promise you diamonds and exquisite antique jewelry that you get to keep. … I’m drinking juice looking at the ocean thinking of you.”      Still, Milliner’s alleged princely persona did not work on everyone. He responded in February 2016 to those who doubted his authenticity.      “I will always be His Royal Highness Prince Daniel DeRothschild IV of the mighty House of DeRothschild,” he wrote on the DeRothschild Facebook page. “And you will forever be the leeches that you were programmed to be. Common. Common as dirt.”      Milliner remains in federal custody in Philadelphia pending his trial scheduled for Oct. 2. If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and could be imprisoned for the rest of his life.      His lawyer, Elizabeth Toplin, declined to comment Thursday. ||||| PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Philadelphia man pretended to be a prince in an elaborate catfishing scheme to get young boys to send them explicit photographs of themselves, according to federal authorities.      The Philadelphia Inquirer reported 49-year-old David Milliner pleaded not guilty to child pornography charges during a court hearing Thursday.      Prosecutors said Milliner claimed he was a man named Prince Daniel David DeRothschild and used photos of Michael Jackson's nephew, T.J. Jackson, to fool his victims.      He claimed that he was a \\"trillionaire,\\" lived in a mansion and was close friends with Prince, George Clooney and Nicki Minaj, according to prosecutors.      \\"He convinced (his victims) that he was rich and famous,\\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Rotella. \\"And he would never send them photos of his face.\\"      Authorities said Milliner used several social media accounts in which he pretended to be members of DeRothschild's entourage to support his claims. He even fabricated a publication, Rich and Royal Magazine, to promote the prince's existence.      Milliner convinced at least five boys he met online to send photos of themselves, prosecutors said.      Police arrested him in February in the Philadelphia apartment where he lived alone.      Milliner faces a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted. He is in federal custody pending an Oct. 2 trial.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more polluted air happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that an increase in air pollution could lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. To discuss this hypothesis, let's first break down the process of respiration and understand how air pollution may influence each step. Then, we will examine if there is indeed an impact on oxygen delivery to the blood. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: When inhaling pollutants, the bronchial tubes can become irritated and inflamed, potentially constraining their diameter. This may lead to difficulty in breathing, reducing the overall air intake, including the oxygen captured by the lungs. 2. Air enters bronchioles: Polluted air can also cause inflammation and constriction in the bronchioles, further impairing the flow of air, including oxygen, into the alveoli. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: Alveoli are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and bloodstream. Air pollution, however, can compromise their functioning. Long-term exposure to pollutants can damage the alveoli's walls and reduce their efficiency in exchanging gases. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels: The capillaries surrounding the alveoli are where oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion takes place. When pollutants enter the bloodstream, they can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially disrupting this diffusion process. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: If pollutants damage or inflame the blood vessels, it may limit their ability to properly absorb and transport oxygen to the body's cells. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: Polluted air may introduce more free radicals and reactive oxygen species to the bloodstream, reducing the overall oxygen-carrying capacity. The presence of these harmful particles may affect the body's ability to effectively distribute oxygen as needed. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to the lungs: The presence of pollutants can hinder the efficient elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream, further exacerbating the strain on the respiratory system. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: Higher levels of pollutants can result in increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs, potentially inducing further constriction and impeding the process of exhaling carbon dioxide. In summary, the proposed perturbation hypothesis assumes that an increase in pollution would lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Based on the analysis of the respiration process, this hypothesis appears implausible. Instead, increased air pollution may substantially impair lung function, disrupt oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion, and negatively impact gas exchange at all stages. Consequently, the net effect of polluted air is likely to result in a decreased amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, leading to potential health risks and complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In classical Greece, Anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and Plato extended the Greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai, \\"ideas\\"). The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words oida (οἶδα, \\"(I) know\\") and eidos (εἶδος, \\"species\\") have the same root as the word idea (ἰδέα), indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Primary Producers/Food Sources Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae use sunlight to fix inorganic carbon. In this symbiotic relationship, these protists provide nutrients for coral polyps (Figure 23.29) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reefbuilding corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.   Q: Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching and eventually die, while corals in turn provide protection, making this what type of relationship?.

Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ex-British prime minister alleges reporters sought his personal data 'News of the World' final edition London (CNN) -- A scandal that already has taken down Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid and launched an inquiry into journalistic practices in the country widened Monday with startling allegations against two more News International newspapers. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown believes journalists from The Sunday Times and The Sun newspapers tried to obtain private information from his financial records and telephone voice messages, a source close to Brown told CNN. The efforts date back some 10 years, and include periods when Brown was prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, the source confirmed. Journalists from The Sun tabloid -- the country's best-selling daily newspaper -- obtained details about Brown's seriously ill son and published a story about him, while people working for the upmarket Murdoch Sunday Times tricked Brown's accountants into handing over financial details, the former prime minister alleges, according to the source. News International, the British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and owner of the papers, issued a statement saying it was aware of the allegations. \\"So that we can investigate these matters further, we ask that all information concerning these allegations is provided to us,\\" the company's statement read. Brown had not publicly addressed the allegations as of Monday evening, but his wife, Sarah Brown, found the news troubling, accoriding to a posting from a Twitter account belonging to her. \\"So sad to learn all I am about my family's privacy - it is very personal and really hurtful if all true,\\" the post read. The new allegations come in the wake of the closure Sunday of another of the company's newspapers, News of the World, over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy. Until it ceased publishing on Sunday, News of the World was the largest-selling Sunday newspaper in the country. The decision to close the News of the World followed accusations that it illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, and claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said Thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone-hacking. The widening scandal and public outrage over it threaten to scuttle plans by Murdoch to create Britain's largest media company by acquiring satellite broadcaster BSkyB. U.K. Media Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced Monday in Parliament that he was referring the proposed sale to the Competition Commission for a thorough review. \\"I know that colleagues on all sides of this house and the public at home feel very concerned at the prospect of the organization which allegedly allowed these terrible things to happen being allowed to take control of what would become Britain's biggest media company,\\" Hunt said. The company said Monday that it was withdrawing its plan to sell television channel Sky News as part of its acquisition of BSkyB pending further consideration of the bid. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Murdoch to reconsider the acquisition in light of public \\"revulsion\\" over the scandal. Earlier Monday, London's Metropolitan Police angrily blasted leaks from its investigation into illegal eavesdropping by News of the World, hours after British media reported that the paper tried to bribe royal protection officers to get private phone numbers for members of the royal family. Police said News International had shared information about alleged efforts by reporters to bribe police, and that both sides had agreed to keep the information confidential. Police said they were \\"extremely concerned and disappointed\\" at the leaks, which they said \\"could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.\\" Police, the royal family and News International all refused to answer CNN questions about allegations that a reporter sought company money to pay a royal protection officer for the confidential details about the royal family. BBC business editor Robert Peston claimed Monday that News of the World e-mails showed former royal correspondent Clive Goodman \\"was requesting cash from the newspaper's editor, Andy Coulson, to buy a confidential directory of the royal family's landline telephone numbers, and all the phone numbers -- including mobiles -- of the household staff.\\" Goodman was sent to prison in 2007 for illegally intercepting royal family voice mails. Coulson insisted he knew nothing about the crime, but resigned as editor because it happened on his watch. He went on to become communications director for David Cameron, who is now the British prime minister, but resigned from that post earlier this year because of fallout from the phone-hacking scandal. He was questioned by police on Friday and released on bail until October. Allegations that the paper's eavesdropping extended to murder and terror victims and the families of fallen troops prompted the News of the World's owner to shut down the paper on Sunday. Murdoch has not apologized to the family of a murdered British teenage girl whose phone messages were illegally intercepted, a lawyer for the girl's family said Monday. Rebekah Brooks, who was editor of the newspaper at the time 13-year-old murder victim Milly Dowler's phone was hacked, should resign, Dowler family lawyer Mark Lewis also said. \\"She should do the honorable thing,\\" Lewis said. \\"She was editor at the time Milly was taken. She should take editorial responsibility\\" for the actions of her journalists, he said. Brooks has since been promoted to chief executive of News International, the company that publishes Murdoch's British newspapers. Murdoch has stood by her so far. She may be questioned by police about the scandal in the coming weeks, a News International source told CNN Monday. The source emphasized that Brooks would be interviewed as a witness, not a suspect, if police do question her, and rejected British press reports that the questioning would take place Monday. The source asked not to be named discussing internal company business. Dowler's mother and sister met Clegg on Monday, keeping the scandal in the public eye despite the abrupt closure of the best-selling tabloid on Sunday. They are due to sit down with Labour leader Ed Miliband on Tuesday and Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, on Wednesday, lawyer Lewis said. Murdoch flew into London Sunday, hours after the final edition of the News of the World hit the stands. Clegg also said: \\"We owe it to the Dowlers\\" to get the bottom of what happened. The News of the World struck a wistful yet proud tone in its final editorial Sunday, and repeated its owner's apology for the criminal activities that brought the paper down. \\"Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry,\\" it said in an unsigned piece. \\"There is no justification for this appalling wrongdoing.\\" The paper welcomed Cameron's call for two inquiries, one into how police investigated the allegations of phone hacking and one into the ethics and standards of British journalists. Separately, police are already conducting their second investigation into the hacking itself. Downing Street on Saturday confirmed that Cameron has approached the head of the judiciary of England and Wales to suggest names for the judge to lead the inquiry into the hacking allegations. News of the World was the first British national newspaper Rupert Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. In addition to owning News of the World, and The Sun, News International owns The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corporation also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. CNN's Richard Greene, Andy Carey and Dan Rivers contributed to this report. Summary:","output":"The UK's phone hacking scandal, which led to the closure of News of the World, has widened as former Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused journalists from The Sunday Times and The Sun of trying to obtain private information from his financial records and phone messages.

The question highlights that the cows were \\"lost in the city\\" and \\"hated the noise.\\" The cows' discomfort suggests that they are not used to the city's hustle and bustle. This fact provides us with an immediate clue about the cows' likely usual habitat: a quieter, more tranquil, natural setting. Among the remaining options, two could fit the above description: a \\"farmyard\\" and \\"countryside.\\" However, countryside is an even more likely option than farmyard because it generally represents a broader, more peaceful, and natural environment where cows can roam freely. Additionally, the countryside connotations of silence and tranquility contrast even more starkly with the presumed noise and confusion of the city, making the countryside an even more attractive option for the cows.  While a farmyard might provide a quieter environment than a city, it doesn't necessarily guarantee the peacefulness and freedom associated with the countryside. Some farmyards could even be noisy or busy, possibly close to urban areas.  The other options are far less likely. A \\"milk machine\\" would not address the cows' desire for a quieter and less chaotic environment. \\"Fairgrounds\\" are generally noisy and bustling places, so they would not serve as a suitable environment for cows seeking tranquility.

Answer: As the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia starting on 30 December 1920, Josip Broz took on many assumed names during his activity within the Party, including \\"Rudi\\", \\"Walter\\", and \\"Tito.\\"  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from:  - yes.  - no.","output":"Yes, the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia in 1920. However, it is important to provide more context and details about the situation in Yugoslavia during that period to give a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Following the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed on December 1, 1918, later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The political climate during this time was turbulent and marked by unrest, with various political factions vying for power and influence within the newly formed state. In the early years of the Kingdom, the government was characterized by a parliamentary system, which saw numerous political parties emerge, including the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY). The CPY was initially founded in 1919 as part of the regional congress of the Socialist Party, inspired by the success of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917. The CPY sought to establish a socialist state in Yugoslavia, advocating for workers' rights and socialist policies. However, the Yugoslav government, led by the Prime Minister Nikola Pašić and his People's Radical Party, was concerned about the growing influence of the CPY. Largely due to a fear of the spread of Bolshevism, the Communist Party was viewed as a destabilizing threat to the Kingdom's stability and unity. As a result, the government outlawed the Communist Party on December 30, 1920. This followed several months of increased political pressure as CPY members were arrested and party properties confiscated. The government also imposed strict censorship on leftist publications and organizations, further suppressing the communist movement. Despite these measures, the CPY continued to operate underground and would play a significant role in the resistance against the Axis powers during World War II. After the war and the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Communist Party, under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, became the ruling party of the newly formed socialist state. The Party would remain in power until the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In conclusion, the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia in 1920 due to the government's fear of the spread of Bolshevism and its perceived threat to the stability and unity of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. However, the Party continued to be active underground and would eventually become the ruling party after World War II and the establishment of the socialist state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the video that has the Tops of the Pops performance from the band that was featured on the Hype! documentary? ?  \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Article: The words on the film will let you know which side of the film should be facing towards you and where the top is.  This should not be an issue if the CT films are on a disk, but you still should check.  When you look at a CT scan, it is like looking in a mirror.  The right side of your body will be on the left side of the film and the left side of your body will be on right.  The uppercase R and L on the films tell you what side of the body is represented on the film, not the actual right and left side of the physical film.  The anterior or front part of your body will be on the top of the film and the posterior or back part of your body will be on the bottom. Numbers will be printed on the CT films.  The CT scan cuts your body into cross-sections which are like very thin slices of bread.  As you look at the images in order, you will notice a normal and natural flow.  Any sudden breaks can suggest disease or an abnormality.  When you look at the special X-rays in order, it is like watching a slow-motion film of the structures and organs inside of you and how they relate to each other.  If you were looking at a CT of your chest, you would see how your large blood vessels and the bronchi (the tubes through which air flows in and out of your lungs) weave through your uniform lung tissue.  Lung cancer would create a noticeable disruption in this pattern. When you view the films on your computer, you will have no issue with scrolling through the images and seeing it as a slow-moving film. The soft tissues, fat, air, and bone inside of you are represented in these different shades.  An unexpected color in a part of your body could be a sign of an abnormality.  Dense tissues like bone show up as white areas.  Both air and fat show up as dark gray or black.  Your soft tissues and any fluid, including blood, will show up in various shades of gray.  Different types of contrast, which shine bright white on the films, are used to better define the structures inside you.  You swallow one type to show the fluid inside your stomach and intestines.  But, another type is injected into your into a vein to show the blood in your vessels or the fluid around an organ.  The latter could be a sign of inflammation, infection, or bleeding. A specific example is looking at the shading on the CT of your brain and knowing you have had a stroke.  The bone of your skull is normal and shines bright white like an egg shell around the grays and black of your brain tissue.  But, there is a small, faint white area surrounded by the grays and black where the stroke has occurred.  Your brain tissue was deprived of blood flow in this area.  The fluid which leaked out of your injured brain cells has contrast in it.  This fluid is white, but it is not as bright as your skull. Bilateral organs should be hard to tell apart like identical twins.  The CT anatomy atlas is a good reference, but the best point of reference is the normal organ on the other side. This will not work for organs like your liver, stomach, or spleen; you only have one of each.  However, your brain has two lobes.  You do have two arms and legs plus organs like your kidneys, lungs, ovaries, and testicles which are bilateral. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting all types of X-rays, including CT scans, has read your films.  She sent a report to your doctor with a detailed description of what she saw on your films. Your doctor ordered the CT scan either to find a diagnosis to explain your symptoms or as a follow-up for a medical problem like cancer, stroke, or a broken bone.  You are a bit nervous or curious.  It seems like the day of your doctor's appointment will never come.  You have a copy of the CT and you decide to take a look.  Reading a CT correctly takes a lot of practice and proper lighting.

Step 2: Isolate the variable term To isolate the variable term, we will add 1014 to both sides of the equation. -408*o - 1014 + 1014 = -3870 + 1014 This simplifies to: -408*o = -2856 Step 3: Solve for o Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by -408 to get the value of o. (-408*o) / -408 = -2856 / -408 The variable o will be: o = 7 So, the solution for the equation -31*o - 377*o - 1014 = -3870 is o = 7."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Clark claim that Gaines, 42, urged them to sell their equal shares while hiding news that HGTV planned to broadcast Fixer Upper and feature the Magnolia brand name, according to the lawsuit obtained by PEOPLE.      “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines,” Gaines’ attorney, Jordan Mayfield, tells PEOPLE.      Gaines posted on Twitter after news of the lawsuit broke on Wednesday, writing, “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it,” The message is a bible verse: John 1:5.      The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. — Chip Gaines (@chipgaines) April 28, 2017      Lewis and Clark founded the company with Gaines in 2007 and the business largely operated out of Waco with a single real estate agent, according to the suit. Now, the Magnolia firm employs “over 93 real estate agents” and operates in nearly every major city in Texas, the suit alleges.

Joanna Gaines Speaks Out About Rumors She’s Leaving Fixer Upper for the Beauty Business      Gaines allegedly bought Lewis and Clark’s shares officially on May 6, 2013, according to the documents published by KARE. Two days later, Gaines publicly announced that Fixer Upper had been picked up by HGTV.      Along with Gaines, the suit names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive (the company that owns HGTV) and High Noon Productions, which produces Fixer Upper.      In a statement to PEOPLE HGTV officials said: “We respect the privacy of our show hosts and will not comment on matters related to their personal lives or businesses.”      The suit was filed just days after Gaines’ wife, Joanna, addressed rumors that she is leaving the hit HGTV show to get into the cosmetics industry.      “You can’t believe everything you read,” Joanna wrote in a note posted on her blog At Home. “No! I am not getting into the business of facial creams. And no worries, believing some of these stories happens to the best of us.” ||||| Chip Gaines has found himself in some legal trouble.      E! News can confirm the Fixer Upper star is being sued by his former Magnolia Real Estate partners for more than 1 million.      John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark filed the documents in Waco, Texas, on Wednesday, claiming Gaines urged them to sell their share of the company two days before HGTV picked up Fixer Upper, which prominently features the Magnolia Real Estate Name.      The partners say Gaines bought out their shares for 2,500 each in May 2013 and claim he threatened to open up a competing realty company if they didn't sell their shares. The documents also included a threatening text message that Gaines allegedly sent to Lewis in which he threatened to physically assault Clark. |||||Summary:","output":"Chip Gaines, star of the popular HGTV show Fixer Upper, is facing a lawsuit from two former partners in Magnolia Real Estate Company for over 1 million.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  and the situation: Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a  closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low.  Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high.  Answer the following question: The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? A:","output":"The container of nitrogen gas that Nicholas keeps in his freezer will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas that Justin keeps outside. To understand why this is the case, let's first discuss the relationships between gas temperature, kinetic energy, and pressure. According to the Kinetic Molecular Theory, when the temperature of a gas rises, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. The increased kinetic energy leads to more frequent and forceful collisions between the gas molecules and the walls of the container. This results in an increased pressure within the container. Based on the information provided in the background, the cylinder of gas that has its Kelvin temperature doubled from 300 K to 600 K experienced a doubling of pressure as well. Conversely, when temperature decreases, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also decreases, resulting in less frequent and less forceful collisions and, therefore, decreased pressure. Now, considering the situation of Nicholas and Justin: - Nicholas: He keeps his closed container of nitrogen gas in the freezer, where the temperature is significantly lower than room temperature. This means that the kinetic energy of the nitrogen molecules will be lower, leading to less forceful collisions with the walls of the container. As a result, the pressure inside Nicholas' nitrogen gas container will be lower. - Justin: He keeps his closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is higher than in a freezer. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the propane molecules will be higher, resulting in more forceful collisions with the walls of the container. This leads to an increased pressure within Justin's propane gas container. In conclusion, the container of nitrogen gas kept in the freezer by Nicholas will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas that Justin keeps in a warmer environment outside. This is because temperature and pressure in a gas are directly related; lower temperature leads to lower pressure, and higher temperature leads to higher pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anxiety simmers about financial \\"Krakatoa\\" By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON (Reuters) - It is something of a truism to say that investors are worried -- they nearly always are. But with the global asset rally racing close to entering its fifth year, a new level of angst is being reached in some quarters. The issue is not just whether current gains on everything from mainstream stock markets to out-of-the-way debt issues are due a correction.

Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved.As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets.

If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. Question: It happens   _  .

Step 1: Gather information First, Betty decided to gather information about fishtail braids. She wanted to make sure she was helping Sarah correctly and not causing any damage to her hair. To do this, she searched online for tutorials and looked at various pictures to understand the technique. Step 2: Prepare materials Next, Betty gathered all the necessary materials needed to create a fishtail braid. This included a hairbrush, comb, hair ties, and hair clips. By having all the required tools at hand, Betty would be able to work more efficiently without needing to interrupt the process. Step 3: Section the hair Betty began by combing Sarah's hair to remove any tangles and ensure it was smooth. She then separated Sarah's hair into two even sections, making sure the parts were clean and neat. By dividing the hair evenly, it would result in a balanced fishtail braid. Step 4: Start the fishtail braid Holding one section of hair in each hand, Betty carefully took a small strand of hair from the outer edge of one section and crossed it over to the other. She then took a small strand from the outer edge of the second section and crossed it over to the first. The key to a successful fishtail braid is to maintain consistency in the size of the strands being crossed over. Step 5: Continue the fishtail braid Betty continued crossing over small strands of hair from the outer edges of each section, making sure to keep the tension consistent and maintain a neat appearance. As she worked her way down Sarah's hair, she occasionally checked her progress against the tutorials and pictures she had found earlier to make sure she was on track. Step 6: Secure the braid Once Betty reached the ends of Sarah's hair, she secured the fishtail braid with a hair tie. She then checked the braid to ensure it was even and there were no loose strands sticking out. Step 7: Final adjustments To give the fishtail braid a more polished look, Betty gently pulled at the edges of the braid to make it slightly wider and appear fuller. She then added a touch of hairspray to keep the braid in place and prevent flyaways. Step 8: Admiring the result Finally, Betty showed Sarah her new fishtail braid in the mirror. Both Sarah and Betty were pleased with the result, and Sarah thanked Betty for taking the time to learn how to create a fishtail braid and help her achieve the desired look."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: The only way to keep a woman happy,' he said, 'is to keep her barefoot and pregnant.'\\" Question: what does barefoot and pregnant mean Answer:","output":"\\"Barefoot and pregnant\\" is a colloquial phrase that has been in use for several decades. It is rooted in traditional gender norms and embodies the sexist belief that women's primary role in society should be limited to being submissive, dependent on their male partners, and focused on bearing and raising children. The imagery of being \\"barefoot\\" implies that women should stay in domestic spaces and not venture out into the world to pursue education, careers, or personal and social independence. In contrast, \\"pregnant\\" represents their perceived biological responsibility to bear children and raise families, thereby fulfilling the traditional expectations of womanhood.  There are several historical and socio-cultural contexts in which this phrase has emerged. Traditional gender norms have long prescribed domestic and child-rearing roles for women, while men have been expected to be breadwinners and protectors. This separation of roles is rooted in the belief that men and women have inherently different characteristics and abilities which should be reinforced through societal norms and expectations. Over time, these norms have been increasingly criticized and challenged, particularly during the women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Women's rights activists have worked hard to dismantle these stereotypes and create opportunities for women to pursue education, careers, and social and political equality. They have advocated for reproductive rights, equal pay, and measures to combat and prevent gender-based violence. However, even with all these advancements, the phrase \\"barefoot and pregnant\\" still persists in some contexts as an unfortunate reminder of the enduring influence and consequences of gender inequality and traditional gender norms. The use of this phrase can perpetuate negative stereotypes, hinder the ongoing pursuit of equal rights, and even contribute to the normalization of domestic violence and other forms of discrimination against women. In conclusion, the phrase \\"barefoot and pregnant\\" is a derogatory and misogynistic expression that reflects outdated and harmful beliefs about women's roles and capabilities. It suggests that women should be confined to domestic spaces and solely focus on motherhood and family, rather than pursuing personal goals and ambitions that exist beyond these narrow confines. It is essential to continue challenging and rejecting such harmful stereotypes, promoting gender equality and recognizing the vast range of contributions women can make in all aspects of society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

This wonderful visual treat is done in stop-action clay animation, a form which is both substantial and magical. It's as if the clay figures kids make have managed to take on a life of their own. 2. This first feature by Nick Park and Peter Lord, the team that brought you Wallace and Gromit, is a diabolically witty piece of work, a haymaker. 3. The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation. 4. Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor. 5. Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe. 6. The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger. 7. It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene. 8.

Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus. 10. Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles. Based on these individual reviews, what is the critic consensus?","output":"The critic consensus is that Chicken Run is a highly entertaining and visually inventive stop-motion clay animation film, filled with British eccentricity, humor, and charm.

So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back?

I know that the answer to the question \\"Vermiform means like a ?\\" is in \\"Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.\\".

Breathing is crucial for providing oxygen to the muscles, which allows them to function during physical activities such as running. Step 3: Consider the impact of fitness on the respiratory system When a person gets very fit, their cardiovascular and respiratory systems become more efficient. This means that their heart, lungs, and blood vessels work together more effectively to deliver oxygen to their muscles during exercise. Step 4: Assess the impact of increased fitness on running a mile A fitter person is more likely to have a more efficient respiratory system, which will allow them to have a better oxygen supply to their muscles. This would enable them to run a mile in less than five minutes, as their muscles can work more efficiently and effectively with the increased oxygen supply.

Sometimes they are afraid to try something to help because it is dangerous to work on the brain. The doctors might make the person worse if he operates on the brain. Dr. Robert White, a famous professor and doctor, thinks he knows a way to help. He thinks doctors should make the brain very cold. If it is very cold, the brain can live without blood for 30 minutes. This gives the doctor a longer time to do something for the brain. Dr. White tried his idea on 13 monkeys. First he taught them to do different jobs, and then he operated on them. He made the monkeys' blood go through a machine. The machine cooled the blood. Then the machine sent the blood back to the monkeys' brains. When the brain's temperature was 10degC, Dr. White stopped the blood to the brain. After 30 minutes he turned the blood back on. He warmed the blood again.

From the sentence alone, it's clear that there's an expectation of some significant challenge or hardship. The speaker seems skeptical about the ability of an island with a population of 4.4 million people to manage the situation. The phrase \\"this madness\\" is very vague and can refer to practically anything that the speaker considers overwhelming or absurd. It could imply a natural disaster, an economic crisis, a pandemic, political unrest, large-scale events or festivals, sudden influxes of tourists, drastic policy changes, war, among many other possibilities. The \\"small island\\" could be any island with around 4.4 million inhabitants. Some examples could include Ireland, New Zealand, or Puerto Rico, all of which have populations in that approximate range. The particular island in question might affect the interpretation of the sentence. Finally, the phrase, \\"How can it be believed?\\" suggests the speaker's disbelief or doubt. They are questioning the assumption or belief that the small island can cope with \\"this madness\\". There's an implicit criticism in the sentiment. The speaker seems to think that it's unrealistic or illogical to hold such a belief. Overall, while we can translate the sentence by itself, understanding the full meaning would require knowledge of the situation the speaker is referring to."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans. The deal was finally completed on July 12, with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy.  On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103-99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.  On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102-90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110-99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.

News article: A wearable camera designed to take a picture every 30 seconds, to allow owners to record their daily lives, has become the latest technogical hit on Kickstarter, the \\"crowd funding\\" website.      So far, Memoto, billed as \\"the world's smallest wearbale camera\\" has attracted more than 44,000 of its 50,000 funding target from more than 250 gadget fans keen to capture a digital record of their entire lives .      The tiny device is designed to be clipped to clothes or worn on a necklace. As well as a five megapixel digital camera, it will feature a GPS chip to keep track of owners' locations and automatically log and organise pictures via a specially-created iPhone and Android apps. Memoto claims the battery will last two days.      \\"Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp,\\" said the Swedish start-up behind the project.      \\"We at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.\\"      Memoto describes the project as \\"lifelogging\\" technology and plans to ship its first finished cameras in February next year.      It is part of a trend dubbed the \\"Quantified Self Movement\\", proponents of which aim to record as much data as possible about their lives. They have adopted other products including the Nike+ FuelBand and Fitbit tracker, both of which keep tabs on wearers' exercise patterns, as well as smartphone apps to track heart rate other health data.      \\"The camera and the app work together to give you pictures of every single moment of your life, complete with information on when you took it and where you were,\\" said Memoto. \\"This means that you can revisit any moment of your past.\\"      The apps the firm is developing are designed to help deal with the glut of images the capture will take by helping organise them and pick out interesting moments.      \\"The way this works is that the photos are organized into groups of \\"moments\\" on a timeline,\\" said Memote.      \\"On the timeline, you're presented with keyframes (about 30 per day) each representing one moment. You can tap a moment to relive it in a stop-motion like video of all the pictures in that moment.\\"      \\"This enables you to not only browse your life the way you remember it, but to search for specific events of your life: who was it that you met at that party or what did the sunset looked like in Lapland in June?\\"      Critics of the Quantified Self Movement argue that, as well as being narcissistic, it makes people live for technology rather than use technology to help them live. The German writer Juli Zeh reportedly described it as \\"self-empowerment by self-enslavement\\".      Others have also raised concerns about privacy, but Memoto said its product would have strict controls and encouraged owners to exerciee restraint.      \\"If someone asks you not to use your Memoto camera - then please don't,\\" it said.      \\"If someone doesn't explicitly ask you, but you have reason to believe that the place or the context is inappropriate for photographing - then please don't.\\" ||||| Would you record your life in a series of geotagged photos? Swedish startup Memoto is betting enough people will want digital memory assistance, and their first-day performance on Kickstarter backs them up.      Life-logging is not a new idea. Steve Mann has been working on it since the 1980s, as has Gordon Bell since the 1990s. Just two months ago, a Microsoft patent application showed how Redmond is trying to capitalize on its years of research in the field of computer-assisted life-recording, and Google clearly has similar applications in mind with Project Glass.      One of the big issues with the concept is the size and wearability of the recording device, which is why an upcoming product from a Swedish company called Memoto is so exciting. They launched a Kickstarter project earlier today and achieved their 50k goal within five hours. At the time of writing they had almost doubled that amount, and are now into a 150k stretch goal phase where backers will get to choose a new colour for the postage-stamp-sized device.      Here’s Memoto’s Kickstarter video:      According to Memoto CEO Martin Källström, who was previously head of the blog search engine Twingly, the company has already benefited from a €500k seed round from Passion Capital and angels such as Amen CEO Felix Petersen. That was enough to start paying the Memoto team – now the Kickstarter cash will see the device become reality.      Not only that: Källström also sees the Kickstarter success as validation for the idea ahead of a Series A round this winter.      How does it work?      The Memoto device measures 36x36x9mm and contains a five-megapixel camera, a GPS unit, an accelerometer and 8GB of storage – enough for two days’ worth of photos, seeing as the device takes a photo every 30 seconds. It will cost 279, or nothing for early backers who give 199 or more.      The user will need to hook the device up to their computer every couple of days, both to upload the photos and recharge the battery. The photos will go onto Memoto’s servers and be made accessible for time-lapse-style playback through smartphone apps.      Crucially for security, the photos will be encrypted and inaccessible even to Memoto’s analytics systems while the user is not logged in. During that log-in time, Memoto’s systems will be able to pick out key frames that represent “moments”, for example the four hours where the user is sitting in front of their computer – these are the frames that will be shown when the user is trying to sift through everything they did on a certain day.      The company reckons each device will generate 1.5TB of data a year (although they will of course be able to delete what they don’t want to remember). Users will pay an annual subscription for the photos’ storage, providing Memoto with a second revenue stream on top of device sales.      “If there weren’t a customized storage service available, it would be a big problem for everyday consumers to keep all the data on-hand in a safe and secure way,” Källström told me.      Keeping memories alive      So, what happens if the user falls on hard times and can’t keep up with their subscription fees? Would that mean the digital equivalent of losing your memory?      “We see that the photos we are storing will be very valuable data and we will do everything to make sure that no mistakes or unfortunate circumstances will cause any data loss,” Källström said. “There will be three ways to get the data down from our storage service: you can download individual images through the app interface in full resolution, you can download in bulk, and there will also be an API where third-party developers can build their own lifelogging apps.”      And what about those patents? Källström reckons the idea of a wearable camera is now well-established enough that there are “no patents hindering new applications in that space”.      Hopefully he’s right. What we’re looking at here is a realization of Microsoft’s old SenseCam project, made realistic – if still a bit pricey – for consumers. Even Gordon Bell is quoted in Memoto’s press release as endorsing the thing.      “A small, wearable, geo-aware camera with pictures going to the cloud is just what we need for life-logging of life’s events. I’m anxious to try the Memoto camera,” Bell said.      High praise indeed – now Memoto just needs to live up to those expectations. We’ll see after the commercial launch early next year. ||||| Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still get a Memoto Camera. Head over to Memoto.com for more info and to place an order.

Have you thought about how much of life that goes missing from your memories? Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp.      We at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.      The functional prototype      The Memoto camera comes in three different colors: Arctic White, Graphite Grey and Memoto Orange      The Functional Prototype      Hardware devices consists of mechanics, electronics and firmware. The mechanics are often overlooked, the 3D printed prototypes in our Kickstarter video has taken two engineers and one industrial designer over four months to finalize. The result is a production-ready construction of a weather protected, very strong and well designed camera casing.      The electronics has taken even longer to develop. We have used evaluation kits and break-out boards to put together a complete set of components in order to be able to start development of the firmware. At the same time we have made a circuit board design that fits all the components into a very tiny package.      What does the functional prototype do?      The prototype does everything the final camera will do, taking photos and registering GPS position.      Sample photo and gps data from the Memoto prototype camera      Miniaturizing the electronics      Not only has miniaturized circuit board been designed by one of Sweden's foremost digital camera engineers who are working on our team, but it is also undergoing careful review and approval from these outside sources:      The head of engineering at our Taiwanese manufacturer, Yomura, to make sure it fits into the camera casing without causing any problems during assembly or long term use      The engineer that created the Anoto pen, in order to verify our power management and battery life      The engineer behind the electronics in the Mutewatch watch, to verify overall build quality and circuit wiring      The GPS chip manufacturer, to verify that the GPS will function properly and to compare it with their reference design      The GPS antenna manufacturer, to verify our antenna placement in relation to other components and the casing      The PCB currently waiting for review and quote from manufacturers.      The 8-layer High-Density-Interconnect printed circuit board with laserdrilled blind and buried vias      Want more details? Here's a word from our engineers:      \\"The Memoto camera is small and uses fine-pitch BGA components with as small as 0.5 mm (0.02\\") distance between the pads. This required the use of an 8-layer IPC-2226 Type-II HDI (High Density Interconnect) PCB of 4/4 mil track/space, with filled and capped laser-drilled partial vias of 0.1 mm (0.004\\") diameter between the outermost layers as well as buried vias, which are mechanically drilled partial vias between layers inside the PCB. This via technology, including placing vias inside the BGA pads, is required to avoid interfering with routing on the top and bottom component layers and make room for fine-pitch BGA escape. Due to the presence of high-speed USB tracks and antenna signals on the PCB, it also has been impedance controlled which involves analysis of how the electric fields behave in the metal layers relative the other dielectric layers in the PCB.\\"      The world's smallest wearable camera      The Memoto camera is a tiny camera and GPS that you clip on and wear. It’s an entirely new kind of digital camera with no controls. Instead, it automatically takes photos as you go. The Memoto app then seamlessly and effortlessly organizes them for you.      Easy and effortless      The camera has no buttons. (That's right, no buttons.) As long as you wear the camera, it is constantly taking pictures. It takes two, geotagged photos a minute with recorded orientation so that the app can show them upright no matter how you are wearing the camera. And it’s weather protected, so you don’t have to worry about it in inclement weather.      The camera and the app work together to give you pictures of every single moment of your life, complete with information on when you took it and where you were. This means that you can revisit any moment of your past.      The Memoto lifelogging camera - only 36x36x9 mm Long battery life The camera’s batteries won't need to be recharged until after approximately 2 days of use (using default photo frequency of 2 shots per minute). To recharge the camera’s batteries, you connect the camera to your computer; at the same time the photos are automatically uploaded to Memoto’s servers. There are no buttons to press. You just wear the camera, then charge it and wear it again. Access your life through the Memoto app With this many pictures captured and stored every day, we think it's crucial that you can easily browse among the best and most meaningful ones. The app we're building for iPhone and Android organizes the photos to work as a photographic memory even after many years. Concept images of the iPhone app. (Photos taken with a iPhone4S). From left: Timeline view with notifications, Map display, Social timeline view Concept images of the Android app. Left: Login screen. Right: Moment view in private mode. Relive your life like you remember it The way this works is that the photos are organized into groups of \\"moments\\" on a timeline. On the timeline, you're presented with keyframes (about 30 per day) each representing one moment. You can tap a moment to relive it in a stop-motion like video of all the pictures in that moment. The image analysis and organization is made out of the images’ metadata, such as time, place and light. This enables you to not only browse your life the way you remember it, but to search for specific events of your life: who was it that you met at that party or what did the sunset looked like in Lapland in June? (Fun fact: there is no sunset in Lapland in June). The app organizes all your photos on a timeline, making them easy accessable to search and share. Your photos are yours and only you can share them The app comes with features for sharing through the biggest social media services. However, we want to stress that your Memoto pictures will always be private by default. That is, you only share pictures when you deliberately want to share them. Cutting your storage costs at least in half The Memoto Camera potentially produces a huge amount of bits and bytes. 4 GB data per day amounts to up to 1,5 terabyte per year. Instead of you storing all this on unreliable and expensive hard drives that can get stolen or lost, Memoto offers safe and secure infinite photo storage at a flat monthly fee, which will always be a lot more affordable than hard drives. For Kickstarter backers, the first year of storage is included in the reward!

The negative perception stems from the phrase \\"a chore to sit through,\\" which conveys a feeling of tediousness and discomfort. This expression indicates that the subject under discussion, possibly a movie, play, or any other form of entertainment, fails to engage, entertain or hold the attention of the audience. It implies that watching or experiencing the subject is a laborious and tiresome activity, making it unenjoyable for the viewer. However, the sentence does include a positive note with the phrase \\"some first-rate performances by its lead.\\" This expression acknowledges the exceptional efforts put forth by the lead actors or performers, praising their skills and talent. This part of the statement conveys a feeling of appreciation and admiration for their contribution, highlighting the high quality of their performance. Consequently, this positive aspect slightly softens the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. In conclusion, the sentence's sentiment is primarily negative, as it conveys the notion that the subject is burdensome and unengaging. However, the mention of excellent performances by the lead takes the edge off the negative tone, providing a small glimmer of positivity. Ultimately, the reader is left with the impression that while some aspects of the subject have merit (namely the lead performers), the overall experience is still less than satisfactory."},{"instruction":"Given the universal set I={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, set M={3,4,5}, and set N={1,3,6}, then the set {2,7,8} is (    ) A: Mcup N B: Mcap N C: (C,M)cup(C,N) D: (C,M)cap(C,N)","output":"**Analysis** This question mainly tests the operations of subsets, intersections, unions, and complements, and is considered a basic question.

This gives us the equation: [ frac{3}{frac{6}{11}} = 3 div frac{6}{11}. ] Next, we recall that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping its numerator and denominator. Therefore, the reciprocal of frac{6}{11} is frac{11}{6}. Substituting this into our equation, we get: [ 3 div frac{6}{11} = 3 cdot frac{11}{6}. ] Now, we proceed with the multiplication. Multiplying 3 by frac{11}{6}, we get: [ 3 cdot frac{11}{6} = frac{3 cdot 11}{6} = frac{33}{6}. ] To simplify this fraction, we notice that both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

For simplicity, let's take a small example like ( k = 1 ), so ( 10 < n < 100 ). 4. **Identify at least one number starting with 1 in the multiples of ( n ):**    If we consider numbers from ( 2n ) to ( 9n ), among these there should be at least one number that starts with 1. 5. **Rearrange the digits of that number:**    If we take such a number and permute its digits by moving 1 to the end and a non-zero digit to the front, the new number should be a multiple of ( n ). 6. **Conclude the non-divisibility by 2 or 5:**    By this logic, ( n ) cannot be divisible by either 2 or 5. This is because if ( n ) were a multiple of 2 or 5, rearranging its digits in such a manner would break the property of divisibility as the last digit determines divisibility by these values. 7. **Use a known result related to linear Diophantine equations:**    According to problem 60514, the equation ( 100x - ny = 12 ) should have a solution in natural numbers ( x ) and ( y ). This implies that some specific number of the form \\"...\\"12 is divisible by ( n ). 8. **Formulate a conclusion based on digit properties:**    If the last two digits are swapped, the new number should maintain the property of divisibility by ( n ). For example, if the original number is 21 and after swapping it becomes 12, the difference ( 21 - 12 = 9 ) must be divisible by ( n ). This step-by-step logic leads us to the conclusion that if an integer divides a number whose divisibility can be determined independently of the order of its digits, that integer must be 3 or 9. **Conclusion:** Thus, the only numbers with a divisibility property that is independent of the order of digits are 3 and 9.

Completing the square, we have: a^2-ab+frac{b^2}{4}+frac{3b^2}{4}-3=left(a-frac{b}{2}right)^2+frac{3b^2-12}{4}geq 0 Since the left side of the equation is the sum of two squares, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of a^{2}+b^{2} occurs when left(a-frac{b}{2}right)^2=0, which implies a=frac{b}{2}. Substituting this back into the equation, we find: left(frac{b}{2}right)^2+b^2-3=0 Solving for b, we get: frac{5b^2}{4}=3 b^2=frac{12}{5} Since a=frac{b}{2}, we have a^2=frac{3}{5}. Thus, the minimum value of a^{2}+b^{2} is frac{3}{5}+frac{12}{5}=boxed{frac{15}{5}=3}. For the maximum value of a^{2}+b^{2}, we can observe that the equation a^2+b^2-ab-3=0 represents an ellipse in the first quadrant. Since c=sqrt{3}, the major axis of the ellipse has a length of 2sqrt{3}. The maximum value of a^{2}+b^{2} occurs when the ellipse's major axis lies along the line y=x. In this case, the vertices of the ellipse have coordinates left(pmsqrt{frac{3}{2}},pmsqrt{frac{3}{2}}right). Therefore, the maximum value of a^{2}+b^{2} is 2left(frac{3}{2}right)=boxed{3+3=6}.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. The train is moving at a speed of 36 kmph (kilometers per hour). To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the speed to meters per second (m/s). 1 kilometer = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 36 kmph is equivalent to: 36 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 10 m/s Now, we know the speed of the train in meters per second and the time it takes to cross the bridge in seconds. We can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Let's plug in the values: Distance = 10 m/s * 82.49340052795776 s Distance = 824.9340052795776 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train (L_train) and the length of the bridge (L_bridge).

The total number of points distributed in the tournament is equal to the total number of games played, since each game results in one point being distributed (either as 1 point to the winner, or 0.5 points to each player in case of a tie). Therefore, the total number of points is:    [    frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}    ] 3. The two grade seven students together scored 8 points.

A: sqrt {16}=pm 4 B: sqrt {16}=4 C: |4|=4 D: 4^{2}=16","output":"To analyze each option step by step: **A**: sqrt{16} = 4. The square root of a positive number is defined as the positive number whose square is the original number. Therefore, sqrt{16} = 4 and not pm 4. Thus, option A is incorrect. **B**: -sqrt{16} = -4. First, we find the square root of 16, which is 4. Then, applying the negative sign, we get -4. Therefore, -sqrt{16} = -4, making option B correct. **C**: |-4| = 4. The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line, regardless of direction. Hence, |-4| = 4 is indeed correct. However, the solution mistakenly marked this option as incorrect. Upon reevaluation, option C is actually correct. **D**: -4^2 = -16. This operation is a common mistake. According to order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), exponentiation comes before multiplication or negation. Thus, -4^2 means -(4^2), not (-4)^2. Therefore, -4^2 = -(4^2) = -(16) = -16, making option D incorrect as per the initial interpretation. However, the solution's explanation was misleading; the calculation shows that -4^2 indeed equals -16, but the interpretation of the option as incorrect was based on a misunderstanding of the notation. Given the above corrections and clarifications: - Option A is incorrect because sqrt{16} = 4. - Option B is correct as stated, -sqrt{16} = -4. - Option C is actually correct, not incorrect as initially stated. - Option D is correctly identified as incorrect based on the standard interpretation of the notation, but the explanation was misleading. Therefore, the correct answer, adhering strictly to the original solution's intent and correcting the oversight, would be B.

Let's approach it in the following detailed steps: 1. **Recall Pick's Theorem**:    Pick's Theorem states that the area (A) of a simple polygon whose vertices are lattice points is    [    A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1,    ]    where (I) is the number of lattice points inside the polygon and (B) is the number of lattice points on the boundary. 2. **Special Case of the Parallelogram**:    Since the problem states that there is at least one other lattice point either inside the parallelogram or on its sides, this means (I + B > 4) (because each vertex is also a lattice point, contributing to (B)). 3. **Apply Pick's Theorem**:    Since (I geq 1) or (B > 4), let's consider both scenarios:    - If there is at least one lattice point inside the parallelogram ((I geq 1)), then using Pick’s theorem:      [      A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 geq 1 + frac{4}{2} - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2.      ]      Therefore, the area (A ) is at least 2 in this scenario.    - If there are no interior lattice points ((I = 0)), but there is at least one additional lattice point on its sides ((B > 4)):      [      A = 0 + frac{B}{2} - 1 > 0 + frac{4}{2} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.      ]      Hence (A > 1). 4. **Alternative Method Using Triangle Areas**:    Consider a typical case where a lattice point lies inside or on the parallelogram, and divide it into triangles. For a triangle with lattice points ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), and ((x_3, y_3)), the area (A_{text{triangle}}) is given by:    [    A_{text{triangle}} = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right|.    ]    Since lattice points imply integer coordinates, this area is at least (frac{1}{2}) and is a multiple of (frac{1}{2}). 5. **Area Calculation with Inside and Boundary Point**:    - If the additional lattice point is inside the parallelogram, split the parallelogram into 4 triangles by joining the point to each of the 4 vertices. Each triangle must have an area of at least (frac{1}{2}). Hence, the total area is at least:      [      4 times frac{1}{2} = 2.      ]    - If the point is on one of the sides, it forms three triangles. Each of those triangles has an area of at least (frac{1}{2}), but since the point lies on the side shared by two triangles, overlap must be subtracted correctly, guaranteeing again the total area is greater than 1. **Conclusion**: The area of the parallelogram, given it contains at least one additional lattice point, is greater than 1.

Here, this gives:    [    angle BEC + angle EBC + angle ECB = 180^circ    ]    Substituting the values from above:    [    angle BEC + frac{B}{2} + frac{C}{2} = 180^circ    ] 4. **Solve for angle BEC**:    [    angle BEC = 180^circ - left(frac{B}{2} + frac{C}{2}right)    ]    Simplifying further:    [    angle BEC = 180^circ - frac{B+C}{2}    ] 5. **Relate B+C to A from triangle ABC**: Using the triangle angle sum property, A + B + C = 180^circ.

But both ( p ) and ( q ) are odd primes, implying ( q - p ) is even. Thus, ( 2 mid m ).    - Assume ( nu_2(n) = k ) for some positive integer ( k ). Then, note that:      [      n^m equiv -1 pmod{p} implies n^{2m} equiv 1 pmod{p}      ]    - Thus, ( text{ord}_p(n) mid 2m ) but ( text{ord}_p(n) nmid m ).

[       text{Sum of lengths} = sum_{i=1}^n | A_i B_i |     ]     - By the principle of the extremum (also known as the extremum principle), such a permutation exists because we are dealing with a finite set of permutations. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**:     - Assume that in this permutation (which minimizes the sum of the lengths) there is an intersecting pair of segments. Let's denote the intersecting segments as ( [A_i B_i] ) and ( [A_j B_j] ).     - Intersection implies that these segments cross each other. 5. **Swapping ( B_i ) and ( B_j )**:     - To resolve the intersection, swap the points ( B_i ) and ( B_j ). This gives us new segments ( [A_i B_j] ) and ( [A_j B_i] ).     - Since the original segments intersect, the configuration ( [A_i B_j] ) and ( [A_j B_i] ) will have a smaller sum of lengths than ( [A_i B_i] ) and ( [A_j B_j] ).     - This is because swapping the endpoints in such a crossing configuration will reduce the total distance due to the triangle inequality and the fact that three points are not collinear. 6. **Contradiction to Minimal Length Sum**:     - The new sum of segment lengths ( | A_i B_j | + | A_j B_i | ) is strictly less than the old sum ( | A_i B_i | + | A_j B_j | ).     - Hence, this contradicts our assumption that the initial renumbering was the one that minimized the sum of segment lengths. 7. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, our initial assumption that there was an intersection must be false.     - Thus, the permutation that minimizes the total length of segments must have no intersecting segments. **Conclusion**:  [ boxed{text{It is possible to renumber the points } B_{1}, ldots, B_{n} text{ such that the segments } [A_{i} B_{i}] text{ do not intersect.}} ]"},{"instruction":"The profit obtained by selling an article for some amount is the same as the loss obtained by selling it for Rs. 43.

Let's denote the stock prices for the days from April 8 to April 19 as variables (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{12}). 2. The prices should be such that the average price condition is satisfied.

To start, consider each 8-digit number overline{a_{1} a_{2} cdots a_{8}} as an arrangement of the digits {1, 2, cdots, 8}. Define the following sets: [ A = {a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7} ] [ B = {a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8} ] where A contains the digits at the odd positions and B contains the digits at the even positions. Let S(A) and S(B) represent the sum of the digits in sets A and B respectively. We know that: [ S(A) + S(B) = 36 ] For the 8-digit number to be a multiple of 11, the difference S(A) - S(B) must be a multiple of 11. Also, since S(A) and S(B) come from different groups of sums, the difference S(A) - S(B) must be either 0 or ±11 because the possible sum range with digits 1 to 8 does not allow larger differences. We can reason the possible cases as follows: 1. **Case 1: S(A) - S(B) = 22**      [    S(A) + S(B) = 36    ]    [    S(A) - S(B) = 22 quad text{which gives us:}    ]    Adding these two equations:    [    2S(A) = 58 implies S(A) = 29    ]    So,    [    S(B) = S(A) - 22 = 7    ]    But the smallest sum of four different numbers chosen from {1, 2, cdots, 8} is obtained by 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, which is greater than 7.

Step 2: Remove zero denominators conditions from consideration Thus for non-zero denominators: [ (sin x + cos x)(sin y + cos y) neq 0 ] We can clear the fractions by multiplying through by ((sin x + cos x)(sin y + cos y)): [ (sin x + cos x)^2 + sin^2 y - cos^2 y = 1 ]  Step 3: Simplify first equation Using ( sin^2 y + cos^2 y = 1 ) and substituting ( sin^2 y - cos^2 y): [ sin^2 y = 1 - cos^2 y ] [ (sin x + cos x)^2 - 2 cos^2 y = 0 ]  Step 4: Solve derived equations and simplify Subtract this from the second given equation in the system: [ 2(sin x + cos x)^2 - (2 cos^2 y + 1) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Thus: [ (sin x + cos x)^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 ] Using identities: [ (sin x + cos x)^2 = sin^2 x + cos^2 x + 2 sin x cos x ] [ = 1 + 2 sin x cos x ] [ = 1 + sin 2x ] So, [ 1 + sin 2x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 ] [ sin 2x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ]  Step 5: Determine values for (x) [ 2x = 60^circ pm n cdot 360^circ ] [ 2x = 120^circ pm n cdot 360^circ ] Thus, [ x = 30^circ pm n cdot 180^circ ] [ x = 60^circ pm n cdot 180^circ ]  Step 6: Find corresponding (y) values Using: [ 2 cos^2 y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 ] [ cos^2 y = frac{1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} = frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{4} ] So, [ cos y = pm sqrt{frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{4}} ] Comparing this with known cosine values: [ cos y = cos 30^circ text{ or } cos 330^circ ] Thus, [ 2y = 30^circ pm n cdot 360^circ ] [ 2y = 330^circ pm n cdot 360^circ ] Thus, [ y = 15^circ pm n cdot 180^circ ] [ y = 165^circ pm n cdot 180^circ ]  Conclusion The solutions are: [ x = 30^circ, 210^circ, 390^circ ldots ] [ x = 60^circ, 240^circ, 420^circ ldots ] [ y = 15^circ, 195^circ, 375^circ ldots ] [ y = 165^circ, 345^circ, 525^circ ldots ] Thus the final answer is boxed below: (boxed{{ (30^circ, 15^circ), (30^circ, 195^circ), (60^circ, 165^circ), (60^circ, 345^circ), ldots }})"},{"instruction":"What is the probability, expressed as a decimal, of drawing one marble which is either green or white from a bag containing 4 green, 3 white, and 8 black marbles?","output":"First, determine the total number of marbles: - There are 4 green marbles, 3 white marbles, and 8 black marbles. - Total number of marbles = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15.

By setting the equation of line AE as y=k(x+a), and substituting x=-c and x=0, we can find the coordinates of M, E. Then, using the midpoint formula, we can find the coordinates of H.

This shows that the circle has its center at (-1,1) and a radius of 1. Since the line x+ay+2=0 intersects the circle, the distance from the circle's center (-1,1) to the line must be less than or equal to the radius of the circle. To find this distance, we use the point-to-line distance formula: Let's find the distance d from the circle's center C(-1,1) to the line L: x+ay+2=0. The formula for the distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C=0 is given by   d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.  Substituting the given values, we have:  d = frac{|(-1) + a(1) + 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + a^2}} = frac{|-1 + a + 2|}{sqrt{1 + a^2}}.  For the line to intersect with the circle, the maximum distance d can equal the radius of the circle, which is 1. Hence, the equation becomes:  frac{|-1 + a + 2|}{sqrt{1 + a^2}} leqslant 1.  This can be simplified to:  |-1 + a + 2| leqslant sqrt{1 + a^2}.  Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root and the absolute value, we get:  1^2 leq 1 + a^2.  Simplifying, we find:  a^2 geq 0.  Since a^2 is always non-negative, the inequality holds true for all values of a. However, because the absolute value sign can result in a change of sign in the numerator depending on the value of a, we must check the two possible cases separated by the point where -1 + a + 2 = 0, which is a = -1.  For a geq -1, the absolute value simplifies directly:  -1 + a + 2 geq 0,   and the inequality holds.

Substituting these values, we get: [ Delta = (-2)^{2}-4(a)(a) = 4-4a^{2} ] For the expression inside the logarithm to always be positive, the quadratic equation should not have real roots, which means Delta < 0.

When A and B work together, their one day work will be the sum of their individual one day works: A's one day work + B's one day work = (1/10) + (1/15) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30 in this case: (3/30) + (2/30) = 5/30 So, together, A and B can do 5/30 of the work in one day, which simplifies to 1/6 of the work in one day. Now, let's find out the ratio of the work done by A and B. Since A does 1/10 of the work in one day and B does 1/15 of the work in one day, the ratio of their work is: A's work : B's work = (1/10) : (1/15) To compare these ratios, we need a common denominator, which is 30: A's work : B's work = (3/30) : (2/30) = 3 : 2 This means that for every 3 parts of the work A does, B does 2 parts.

Rate for the descent = 1.5 * Average rate for the ascent Rate for the descent = 1.5 * 3 miles per day Rate for the descent = 4.5 miles per day Since the hikers will take two days to descend, we can calculate the total distance for the downward route by multiplying the rate for the descent by the number of days.

Next, we explore sequences that maintain the triangle’s orientation: Reflections change orientation, so to return (T) to its original position, an even number of reflections or none is acceptable.  Case 1: No reflections Only rotations are involved. Rotations totaling to (360^circ) or equivalent are considered: - (120^circ + 240^circ = 360^circ). - (180^circ + 180^circ = 360^circ). Each combination can be rearranged in (3!) ways. Since there are 2 options for (360^circ), this yields (2 times 6 = 12) valid sequences.  Case 2: Two reflections The two reflections essentially rotate the coordinates and revert orientation twice, resulting in (180^circ) rotation: - Reflecting across both (y=x) and (y=-x) results in a (180^circ) rotation.

Since the hexagon is regular (all interior angles are equal), each interior angle is    [    frac{720^circ}{6} = 120^circ    ] 3.

These intersections form the triangle ( XYZ ). 5. Since ( angle XAB, angle XBA, angle YCD, angle YDC, angle ZEF, ) and ( angle ZFE ) are the exterior angles of the hexagon, each of these angles is ( 60^circ ). Consequently, triangles ( XAB, YCD, ) and ( ZEF ) are equilateral triangles (all angles are ( 60^circ )). 6.

Therefore, statement A is correct. 2. **Implication of both f(x-1) and f(x-2) being even:** - For f(x-1) being even, as established, we have: [f(-x-1) = f(x-1) implies f(-2-x) = f(x)] - For f(x-2) being even, we have: [f(-x-2) = f(x-2) implies f(-4-x) = f(x)] Combining these, we get: [f(x) = f(x+2)] This shows that 2 is a period of f(x), making statement B correct. 3. **For the derivative f'(x) and its symmetry:** Given f(x-2) is even, we have: [f(-x-2) = f(x-2)] Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get: [-f'(-x-2) = f'(x-2)] This implies the graph of f'(x) is symmetric about the point (-2,0).

Consider a rectangle ( ABCD ). Without loss of generality, let the vertices be ( A = (0, 0) ), ( B = (a, 0) ), ( C = (a, b) ), and ( D = (0, b) ). 2. We need to find the equations of the angle bisectors of the corners of the rectangle. Let's start with the angle bisectors at vertices ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), and ( D ). 3. The angle bisector at vertex ( A ) divides the (angle DAB) into two equal parts. Since (angle DAB = 90^circ), each part will be (45^circ). Therefore, the equation of the angle bisector at point ( A ) is given by: [ text{slope} = tan(45^circ) = 1 ] So, the equation is: [ y = x ] 4. Similarly, the angle bisector at point ( C ) will have the slope of (tan(45^circ) = 1), but it passes through ( (a, b) ), therefore: [ y - b = x - a implies y = x + b - a ] 5. The angle bisector at vertex ( B ) divides the (angle ABC) into two equal parts. Here, (angle ABC = 90^circ), each part (45^circ). Since the angle bisector's slope will be: [ text{slope} = tan(45^circ) = -1 ] and it passes through ( (a, 0) ): [ y - 0 = -1(x - a) implies y = -x + a ] 6. The angle bisector at vertex ( D ) will also have the slope of ( -1 ), but it passes through ( (0, b) ): [ y - b = -1(x - 0) implies y = -x + b ] 7. To find the point of intersection of these angle bisectors, we solve the system of equations pairwise. 8. Intersecting ( y = x ) and ( y = -x + b ): [ x = -x + b  2x = b  x = frac{b}{2} ] Substituting ( x = frac{b}{2} ) back into ( y = x ): [ y = frac{b}{2} ] One intersection point is ( left( frac{b}{2}, frac{b}{2} right) ). 9. Intersecting ( y = x ) and ( y = x + b - a ): [ x = x + b - a  0 = b - a ] Thus, this equation provides no additional point since it only verifies ( b = a ) which isn't required for generality. 10. Lastly, solving ( y = -x + a ) and ( y = x + b - a ): [ -x + a = x + b - a  a + a = x + x + b  2a - b = 2x  x = frac{2a - b}{2} ] Substituting back ( x ) in either equation provides: [ y = - frac{2a - b}{2} + a = frac{2a - b}{2} ] Conclusively, the intersection points divide into clear quadrilateral symmetry providing a square. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The bisectors form a square}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given p: 2 leqslant x leqslant 11, q: 13m leqslant x leqslant 3+m (m > 0), if lnot p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for lnot q, then the range of the real number m is _____.","output":"Since lnot p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for lnot q, Hence, q is a necessary but not sufficient condition for p, That is, p Rightarrow q, but q does not imply p, Thus, begin{cases} 1 - 3m leqslant -2  3 + m geqslant 11 end{cases}, which simplifies to begin{cases} m geqslant 1  m geqslant 8 end{cases}, So, m geqslant 8.

The equation x^2 + y^2 = frac{1}{2} represents a circle centered at the origin with radius (sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), which is smaller than the original circle of radius 1. 7. As any point P that satisfies x^2 + y^2 = frac{1}{2} also lies within the larger circle of radius 1, we can conclude that this secondary, smaller circle lies entirely within the original circle. 8.

The overall number of toy soccer balls sold by Student B is:    [    frac{1000}{x} + frac{1000}{y} + frac{1000}{z}    ]    The average revenue per toy soccer ball for Student B is thus:    [    frac{3000}{frac{1000}{x} + frac{1000}{y} + frac{1000}{z}} = frac{3}{frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}}    ] 4. **Compare the Two Averages Using AM-HM Inequality:**    By the Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) inequality:        [    (x + y + z) left( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} right) geq 9    ]    This inequality holds because:    [    x > 0, quad y > 0, quad z > 0    ]    Therefore, we get:    [    frac{x + y + z}{3} geq frac{3}{frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}}    ] 5. **Equality Condition:**    The equality holds if and only if ( x = y = z ). 6. **Conclusion:**    When the prices of the toy soccer balls are equal ( (x = y = z) ), both students' promotion effectiveness is the same. However, if the prices differ ( (x, y, z) ), the average revenue per ball for Student A will be higher, indicating that Student A’s promotional effectiveness is better.

So, the total number of eggs in the box is boxed{52,}  and the weight of the eggs in grams is approximately 4067.86 grams."},{"instruction":"Calculate the remainder when the sum 2150 + 2151 + 2152 + 2153 + 2154 + 2155 is divided by 12.","output":"First, find each number modulo 12: - 2150 mod 12 = 10 - 2151 mod 12 = 11 - 2152 mod 12 = 0 - 2153 mod 12 = 1 - 2154 mod 12 = 2 - 2155 mod 12 = 3 Now add these modulo results: [ 10 + 11 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 27 ] Finally, find 27 mod 12: [ 27 equiv 3 pmod{12} ] Thus, the remainder when 2150 + 2151 + 2152 + 2153 + 2154 + 2155 is divided by 12 is boxed{3}."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:_},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],N={key:0},Y={key:1};function E(o,e,h,f,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
