Let's analyze the case when ( q < n ): - Given ( q leq n ), we have ( q mid (n-1)! ) because any integer ( q leq n ) will have its prime factors as a subset of the prime factors of ((n-1)!). - Since ( q ) is a factor of ((n-1)!), it follows that ( q(q-1) mid (n-1)! ). Therefore, [ q - 1 mid frac{(n-1)!}{q} ] By definition, we have [ q - 1 mid leftlfloor frac{(n-1)!}{q} rightrfloor ] because ( leftlfloor frac{(n-1)!}{q} rightrfloor ) is the greatest integer less than or equal to ( frac{(n-1)!}{q} ). 2. Now, consider the case when ( q = n ): - We need to discuss two scenarios: when ( n ) (and thus ( q )) is a prime number and when it is composite. 3. When ( n ) is a prime number: - According to Wilson's Theorem, for a prime ( n ): [ (n-1)! equiv -1 pmod{n} ] This implies that [ (n-1)! = kn + (n-1) text{ for some integer } k ] Thus: [ frac{(n-1)!}{n} = k + frac{n-1}{n} ] And thus: [ leftlfloor frac{(n-1)!}{n} rightrfloor = k ] Notice that since ( k ) is an integer, it implies ( k ) is divisible by ( q - 1 = n - 1 ). 4. When ( n ) is composite: - Let ( n = pm ), where ( p ) is the largest prime factor of ( n ) such that ( 1 < m < n ). Hence, ( p ) and ( m ) are both less than ( n ). - Since ( n-1 ) and ( n ) are coprime, ( 1 < m leq n-2 ) and so ( p leq n-2 ) by similar logic. - If ( p ) and ( m ) are distinct, we will have: [ p mid (n-2)! quad text{ and } quad m mid (n-2)! ] Hence, ( n = pm mid (n-2)! ), implying [ n(n-1) mid (n-1)! ] Therefore, [ q-1 = n-1 mid leftlfloor frac{(n-1)!}{n} rightrfloor ] 5. If ( p = m ), then ( n = p^2 ), and we know ( n > 4 ) implying ( p > 2 ): - Since ( (2p, n) = p ) and thus, [ 2p neq n-1 Rightarrow 2p leq n-2 ] Since both ( p ) and ( 2p ) must divide ( (n-2)! ), it follows that: [ 2p^2 mid (n-2)! ] Thus, [ n(n-1) mid (n-1)! ] This completes the proof. Hence [ q-1 mid leftlfloor frac{(n-1)!}{q} rightrfloor ] holds true in all cases.

Given that the polynomial ( P ) has integer coefficients and ( P(x) = 5 ) for five different integers ( x ), let's denote these integers as ( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, ) and ( x_5 ). 2. Based on this information, we know that: [ P(x_k) = 5 quad text{for} quad k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] 3. We can express the polynomial ( P(x) ) in the form: [ P(x) - 5 = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)(x - x_4)(x - x_5)Q(x) ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. 4. Now, let's assume that there exists an integer ( x_0 ) such that ( P(x_0) = n ). From this, we have: [ P(x_0) - 5 = n - 5 ] Substituting this into our earlier expression for ( P(x) - 5 ), we get: [ n - 5 = (x_0 - x_1)(x_0 - x_2)(x_0 - x_3)(x_0 - x_4)(x_0 - x_5)Q(x_0) ] This means ( n - 5 ) must be a product of six non-zero integers, five of which are distinct (because the ( x_k ) are distinct). 5.

The absolute value of ( n - 5 ) (denoted ( |n - 5| )) therefore lies between 1 and 11: [ |n - 5| leq 11 quad Rightarrow -11 leq n - 5 leq 11 ] 8.

Considering the absolute value of this product: - The smallest absolute value for a product of five distinct non-zero integers is ( 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 = 120 ). - This means the smallest product in absolute value for six non-zero integers would be ( 120 ) multiplied by the smallest integer greater than ( 1 ), for example ( 1 ): ( 1 times 120 geq 120). 10. Given that ( 120 ) is much larger than ( 11 ), it is impossible for ( |n - 5| ) to be as low as ( 11 ), making it impossible for ( n - 5 ) to satisfy the required conditions.

We know that W1 = 15 (since she won her first 10 fights and then 5 more before losing). We also know that at the end of her career, she has 28 more wins than losses. Since she only lost twice (once before retiring and once before increasing her number of wins), we can denote her losses as L = 2. The total number of wins at the end of her career is W1 + W2. We can set up the equation based on the information that she has 28 more wins than losses: W1 + W2 = L + 28 We already know that W1 = 15 and L = 2, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 15 + W2 = 2 + 28 Now, we solve for W2: W2 = 30 - 15 W2 = 15 So, Tina had 15 wins after her first loss, which is the same as the number of wins before her first loss (W1). The ratio of her wins after her first loss (W2) to her wins before her first loss (W1) is therefore: W2 : W1 = 15 : 15 = 1 : 1 The ratio of her wins after her first loss to her wins before her first loss is boxed{1:1} ."},{"instruction":"The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_n} is S_n, and 4a_1, 2a_2, a_3 form an arithmetic sequence.

This gives Dima a strategic advantage by responding to Gosha's moves. 3. Let’s analyze the game vertically first. Every column consists of 14 rows. We can partition each column into pairs of cells as follows: (a, a+7), (b, b+7), ..., up to the 7th row. This means the pairs are (1, 8), (2, 9), (3, 10), (4, 11), (5, 12), and (6, 13). 4.

It's clear that in any row, Gosha cannot form a winning sequence horizontally since Dima will always respond and block any potential sequence from exceeding 6 consecutive cells. 6. Now let’s hypothesize the vertical case. For Gosha to win vertically in a given column, he needs to place 7 consecutive \\"O\\"s in that column.

We need to prove that the area of quadrilateral A B C D, denoted as S_{A B C D}, is less than sqrt{2} and then find the maximum possible value of S_{A B C D}. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Setup and Intersection Points**: - The equation of the circle with center at (0,1) can be written as: [ x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = R^2 ] - The given parabola is: [ y = x^2 ] 2. **Solving for Intersection Points**: - Substitute y = x^2 into the circle's equation: [ x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2 = R^2 ] Simplify to get: [ x^2 + (x^4 - 2x^2 + 1) = R^2 ] [ x^4 - x^2 + 1 - R^2 = 0 ] 3. **Quadratic in terms of y**: - Substitute y = x^2 into the circle's equation: [ x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = R^2 ] - Simplify to form a quadratic equation in y: [ y^2 - y + 1 - R^2 = 0 ] - By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots y_1 + y_2 = 1 and the product of roots y_1 y_2 = 1 - R^2. 4. **Geometric Mean and Median Line**: - This shows that y_1 + y_2 = 1, meaning the midline of the trapezoid A B C D is at y = frac{1}{2}. - The length of this line |MN| can then be broken down further. By analyzing the parabola and circle symmetry: [ |MN| < 2 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} ] 5. **Height Calculation**: - The height of the trapezoid can be evaluated as: [ h = |y_1 - y_2| ] Using the earlier result y_1 + y_2 = 1, it follows: [ h = |y_1 - y_2| < y_1 + y_2 = 1 ] 6. **Area of Quadrilateral**: - The area S_{A B C D} can thus be evaluated: [ S_{A B C D} = h cdot MN < sqrt{2} ] 7. **Discriminant Condition**: - Ensuring 4 intersection points, the discriminant of the quadratic y^2 - y + 1 - R^2 = 0 must be positive: [ 1 - 4 cdot (1 - R^2) > 0 ] This simplifies to: [ R > frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] And since for R geq 1 there would be 0 or 2 intersection points.

Arun alone completes the remaining 3/5 of the work in 18 days. Therefore, Arun does 1/18 of the work in one day. So we can write: A = 1/18 (Equation 2) Now we can substitute the value of A from Equation 2 into Equation 1 to find the value of T: 1/18 + T = 1/10 To solve for T, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 90 in this case: (5/90) + T = 9/90 Now subtract 5/90 from both sides to solve for T: T = (9/90) - (5/90) T = 4/90 T = 1/22.5 Now that we have the value of T, we can find out how long it would take for Arun to do the work alone. We already know from Equation 2 that Arun does 1/18 of the work in one day. To find out how many days it takes for Arun to do the work alone, we take the reciprocal of 1/18: Days for Arun to do the work alone = 1 / (1/18) = 18 Therefore, it takes Arun boxed{18} days to do the work alone."},{"instruction":"a spinner, all circles have the same center: The inner ring is divided into equal sections numbered 1 and 2.

Let's call this cell A. 2. **Traversal and intersection points:** When traveling along the line starting from A, it must intersect the diagonal again at another point, which we call B. By symmetry, traversing the line in the opposite direction from A will also lead to an intersection at B. Since the line is closed and does not intersect itself, it must intersect the diagonal at exactly these two points, A and B. 3. **Diagonal cells and color constraints:** On a 15 times 15 chessboard, the diagonal itself contains 15 cells, and if the diagonal is colored black (assuming a checkerboard coloring), then there are frac{15^2 + 1}{2} = 113 black cells in the entire grid. This comes from summing the total cells and noting the symmetric midpoint cell. 4. **Symmetry and cell count:** Because the line is symmetric and does not intersect itself, the cells on the diagonal, apart from A and B, are not reached by the line. Thus, there are 15 - 2 = 13 black cells on the diagonal that are unused. 5. **White and black cell traversal:** The line must traverse equal black and white cells due to the black-white symmetry from the initial coloring. Therefore, it crosses through fewer than 113 black cells within the grid, since the path avoids 13 black cells on the diagonal. With symmetry, it also must cross fewer than 113 white cells. 6. **Limit on the number of cells traversed:** Therefore, the total number of distinct cells (both black and white) the line crosses will be less than or equal to 2 times 100 = 200, calculated as: [ 113 - 13 = 100 implies text{total cells traversed} leq 2 times 100 = 200 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{200} ]"},{"instruction":"Let A be a set of finite positive integers.

This inequality can be manipulated to understand the conditions under which it holds true. First, we multiply both sides by a (noting that a is nonzero) to avoid division by zero, which gives us a^2 > 1. This can be rewritten as a^2 - 1 > 0, which simplifies to frac{a^2 - 1}{a} > 0 by multiplying both sides by frac{1}{a}, keeping in mind the sign of a to ensure the inequality direction remains correct. Next, we factor the numerator to get frac{(a-1)(a+1)}{a} > 0. This inequality tells us about the values of a that satisfy the condition. Specifically, it implies that a > 1 or -1 < a < 0 for the inequality to hold true. This is because, for the product of factors to be positive, either both factors must be positive (which happens when a > 1) or both must be negative (which is not possible with the given factors and the condition that a is nonzero and real). From the above analysis, we see that if a > 1, then it automatically satisfies a > frac{1}{a}. This shows that \\"a > 1\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"a > frac{1}{a}\\" because if a > 1 is true, then a > frac{1}{a} will also be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. From a > frac{1}{a}, we cannot directly conclude that a > 1 because, as shown, -1 < a < 0 also satisfies the original inequality. This indicates that \\"a > 1\\" is not a necessary condition for \\"a > frac{1}{a}\\" because there are other values of a (specifically, -1 < a < 0) that make a > frac{1}{a} true without a being greater than 1. Therefore, we conclude that \\"a > 1\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"a > frac{1}{a}\\". This aligns with option A: Sufficient but not necessary condition.

In a trapezoid, the bases (the two non-parallel sides) are parallel to each other. Since J and K have the same x-coordinate, JK is a vertical line, and therefore, the line LM must also be vertical to be parallel to JK. This means that the x-coordinate of M must be the same as the x-coordinate of L, which is 6. To find the y-coordinate of M, we can use the fact that the distance between the bases (JK and LM) must be the same. The y-coordinate difference between J and K is 2 - (-4) = 6. Since M must be directly below L to keep the bases parallel, the y-coordinate of M must be 6 units below the y-coordinate of J, which is -4. Therefore, the y-coordinate of M is -4 - 6 = -10. So, the coordinates of vertex M are (6, -10). Now, let's calculate the perimeter of the trapezoid. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides. First, we calculate the lengths of the sides JK, KL, and LM using the distance formula: Distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²) JK = √((-2 - (-2))² + (2 - (-4))²) JK = √(0² + 6²) JK = √36 JK = 6 units KL = √((6 - (-2))² + (8 - 2)²) KL = √((8)² + (6)²) KL = √(64 + 36) KL = √100 KL = 10 units LM = √((6 - 6)² + (8 - (-10))²) LM = √(0² + 18²) LM = √324 LM = 18 units Finally, we need to calculate the length of JM. Since J and M have the same x-coordinate difference as K and L, JM will be the same length as KL, which is 10 units.

However, the equation given does not hold true for x = y = 6. Let's try to solve the equation without assuming that both numbers are 6: x^2 = 8y^2 - 224 To find the ratio of x to y, we need to express x in terms of y or vice versa.

Our goal is to minimize the distance between points ( E ) and ( F ). 2. **Geometric Setup:** Points ( E ) and ( F ) lie on the circle in which ( CD ) is the diameter. This is due to the fact that ( DE ) and ( DF ) are perpendicular to ( AC ) and ( BC ), respectively, forming right angles. 3. **Chords and Diameters:** The length of chord ( EF ) is dependent on the diameter ( CD ) because for a given angle subtending a circle, the length of the chord is minimized when the endpoints of the chord are closest to each other (also translating to the shortest distance through the perpendicular). 4. **Calculating Minimal Chord:** For the chord ( EF ) to be minimal, the diameter ( CD ) of the circle must be the shortest possible split from vertex ( C ) to line ( AB ). 5. **Conclusion:** The shortest possible split of ( CD ) from vertex ( C ) to line ( AB ) occurs when ( CD ) is the altitude from ( C ) to ( AB ).

Therefore, with 79 flights, a cycle must exist. 5. **Constructing a flight arrangement without cycles**: To show that 78 flights can be arranged without forming a cycle, consider the following construction: - Arrange flights such that if ( i > j ), then there is a flight from ( C_i ) to ( C_j ). - This means each country ( C_i ) (for ( i > 1 )) has flights to all countries ( C_j ) where ( j < i ). 6. **Verifying no cycles in the construction**: In this arrangement, any sequence ( A_k ) will have strictly decreasing indices, and thus it is impossible to return to the starting country, ensuring no cycles are formed. 7. **Conclusion**: Since 78 flights can be arranged without forming a cycle, but 79 flights must form a cycle, the smallest number of flights required to ensure a cycle exists is 79.

We also know that a total of 440000 copies of the novel were sold, and 363600 of them were paperback copies. This means that the total number of hardback copies sold is 440000 - 363600 = 76400.

Since line ( h ) is perpendicular to planes ( gamma ) and ( gamma_1 ), it is also perpendicular to these intersecting lines. Thus, two different perpendiculars to ( h ) would exist through point ( D ) in plane ( varphi ), which is impossible. 13. Therefore, the assumption that such a second plane ( gamma_1 ) exists leads to a contradiction, confirming that there is indeed a unique plane ( gamma ) through point ( M ) that is perpendicular to line ( h ).

Relative speed in m/s = 300 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = (300 * 5) / 18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 1500 / 18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 83.33 m/s The time taken to cross each other is 24 seconds.

Each of these can be calculated using known formulas for the sum of squares, sum of arithmetic series, and the sum of a constant. The final calculation gives us: S_{100} = frac{100 cdot (100+1)}{2} + sum_{k=1}^{50} (4k - 1) = 5050 + frac{50 cdot (3 + 199)}{2} = 5050 + frac{50 cdot 202}{2} = 5050 + 5050 = 10100.

For clarity, let's denote this sequence as ( M ) (so ( M = 1ldots1 )). The specific number ( M ) will be determined later. For instance: [ n = 13 cdot 111 ldots 1 ] 2. **Permuting Digits**: If we swap the digit '1' with another nonzero digit, for example '3', we get: [ n' = 31ldots1 ] Let's choose ( M ) such that ( 1ldots1 ) (with sequences of ones) has a particular number of digits. 3. **Prime Factors Analysis**: Given that ( n = 13 cdot 1ldots1 ) initially, let’s denote the swapped number of the form ( n' ) as ( n' = 31 cdot 1ldots1 ). 4. **Preservation of Prime Factors**: If the original number composed entirely of ones (excluding the ends and containing no zeros) divisible by ( 13 ) and swapping digits result in the number divisible by ( 31 ): [ n = 13 cdot 1ldots1 quad text{and} quad n' = 31 cdot 1ldots1 ] Both of these new numbers share the prime factors if: [ 13 cdot 31 = 403 ] The product of ( 13 ) and ( 31 ), which are primes, ensures that the prime factors remain constant because the numbers are constructed to be inherently divisible by ( 403 ) (i.e., ( n ) and ( n' )). 5. **Verification of the Number’s Form**: A number ( 13 cdot 1ldots1 ) or sequence with clear evidence (task #60739 proof) shows that choosing the right number of sequences will keep the prime factors unaltered. By induction, choosing a sufficiently large number of sequences of one makes the entire number ( n ) greater than ( 10^{1000} ). 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, confirming the existence of such a number proves the condition stated in the problem. Therefore, the number ( n ) greater than ( 10^{1000} ) exists with the specified property.

Consider the given integral: int_{0}^{pi / 2} cos ^{2}(cos x) + sin ^{2}(sin x) , dx 2. We can write the integral as the sum of two separate integrals: int_{0}^{pi / 2} cos ^{2}(cos x) , dx + int_{0}^{pi / 2} sin ^{2}(sin x) , dx 3. To simplify the second integral, we perform a substitution. Let ( y = frac{pi}{2} - x ). Consequently, ( dy = -dx ). 4. Changing the limits of integration for ( y ): - When ( x = 0 ), ( y = frac{pi}{2} ). - When ( x = frac{pi}{2} ), ( y = 0 ). Therefore, the second integral transforms as follows: int_{0}^{pi / 2} sin ^{2}(sin x) , dx = int_{pi / 2}^{0} sin ^{2}left(sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - yright)right)(-dy) 5. Simplify the integrand further using the trigonometric identity ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - yright) = cos y ): int_{pi / 2}^{0} sin ^{2}(cos y)(-dy) = int_{0}^{pi / 2} sin ^{2}(cos y) , dy 6. Substitute back into the original expression. The original integral now becomes: int_{0}^{pi / 2} cos ^{2}(cos x) , dx + int_{0}^{pi / 2} sin ^{2}(cos x) , dy 7. Recognize that both integrals have the same integrand, just different functions; we can combine them: int_{0}^{pi / 2} left( cos ^{2}(cos x) + sin ^{2}(cos x) right) , dx 8. Notice that ( cos ^{2}(u) + sin ^{2}(u) = 1 ) for any ( u ): cos ^{2}(cos x) + sin ^{2}(cos x) = 1 9. Therefore, the integral simplifies to: int_{0}^{pi / 2} 1 , dx 10.

Each such pair adds up to ( k ). This leads to the following relationship: S(k) = frac{k varphi(k)}{2}, where ( varphi(k) ) is Euler's Totient Function, denoting the number of integers up to ( k ) that are coprime with ( k ). 2. **Given equation analysis:** From the given problem, we need to show that for any positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) (where ( n ) is odd), there exist positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that: m mid x quad text{and} quad 2 S(x) = y^n. 3. **Representing integer ( m ):** Let ( m ) be expressed as a product of primes: m = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_k^{alpha_k}, where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are distinct primes in ascending order, ( p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_k ), and ( alpha_i in mathbb{N} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 4. **Choice of ( x ) meeting the condition ( m mid x ):** We choose: x = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} cdots p_k^{beta_k}, where ( beta_i ) are integers such that ( beta_i geq alpha_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). This ensures ( m mid x ). 5. **Calculating ( varphi(x) ):** Using the product form of Euler's Totient Function: varphi(x) = x prod_{i=1}^{k} left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right). 6. **Calculating ( 2 S(x) ):** Given: 2 S(x) = x varphi(x). Substituting the formula for ( varphi(x) ): 2 S(x) = x cdot x prod_{i=1}^{k} left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right).

Therefore, any multiple of 75 must be of the form ( n = 3^a times 5^b times k ), where ( a geq 1 ) and ( b geq 2 ). 3. **Divisor function:** - The number of divisors of ( n = p_1^{e1} times p_2^{e2} times cdots times p_k^{ek} ) is given by the product of ( (e1+1)(e2+1) cdots (ek+1) ). - Here, since (n) must have exactly 75 divisors, we need ( (a+1)(b+1)(c1+1)(c2+1)cdots = 75 ), where (c1, c2, ldots) represent the exponents of other prime factors in ( n ). 4. **Factorization of 75:** - The prime factorization of 75 is ( 75 = 3 times 5^2 ). - Now, break down 75 into product of integers: (75 = 3 times 5 times 5). 5. **Assigning values to obtain the minimum (n):** - One possible combination of the exponents could be: - ( a+1 = 3 implies a = 2). - ( b+1 = 5 implies b = 4). - ( c1+1 = 5 implies c1 = 4) and no additional prime factors are needed. - Therefore, a potential minimal (n) is: [ n = 3^2 times 5^4. ] 6. **Verification:** - Verify if ( n = 3^2 times 5^4 = 9 times 625 = 5625 ) has exactly 75 divisors: [ text{Number of divisors} = (2+1) times (4+1) = 3 times 5 = 15 times 5 = 75 ] which is correct. 7. **Finding ( frac{n}{75} ):** - Compute: [ frac{n}{75} = frac{5625}{75} = 75. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{75} ]"},{"instruction":"A restaurant offers diet soda and regular soda.

The ratio of regular sodas sold to diet sodas sold is: Regular sodas : Diet sodas 36 : 28 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 4 in this case. 36 ÷ 4 = 9 28 ÷ 4 = 7 So, the simplified ratio of regular sodas sold to diet sodas sold is boxed{9:7} ."},{"instruction":"A rectangle is divided into right triangles that share sides only along whole lengths, such that the common side of two triangles always serves as the leg of one and the hypotenuse of the other. Prove that the ratio of the longer side of the rectangle to the shorter side is at least 2.","output":"1. **Initial Conditions and Problem Interpretation:** We begin by interpreting the problem statement. It mentions that a rectangle is divided into right triangles such that any common side between two triangles serves as a leg of one triangle and the hypotenuse of another. We are tasked with proving that the ratio of the longer side of the rectangle to the shorter side is at least 2. 2. **Representation and Notation:** Let us denote: - The number of right triangles obtained from the division as ( n ). - The number of hypotenuses lying on the boundary as ( m ). - The sum of leg segments on the boundary ( k ). 3. **Counting the Legs and Hypotenuses:** Considering the configuration provided by the problem, we note the following relationships: [ text{Number of legs} = 2n ] [ text{Number of hypotenuses} = n ] Let ( m ) be the number of hypotenuses on the boundary. Then the number of hypotenuses inside is ( n - m ). 4. **Vertices on the Boundary:** The total number of vertices constituting the boundary of the rectangle is given by: [ m + (n + m) = 2m + n ] Note that four of these vertices are actually corners of the rectangle. 5. **Interior Vertices:** Let ( k ) be the number of vertices strictly inside the rectangle. Therefore, the equation representing the sum of the angles of all triangles can be formulated, considering that each triangle contributes ( 180^circ ): [ 180^circ n = 360^circ k + 180^circ (n + 2m - 4) + 90^circ cdot 4 ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 180n = 360k + 180(n + 2m - 4) + 360 ] [ 180n = 360k + 180n + 360m - 720 + 360 ] [ 0 = 360k + 360m - 360 ] [ k + m = 1 ] 6. **Analyzing the Findings:** This implies that ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 1 ), or vice versa. Importantly, ( m ) must be greater than zero (i.e., some hypotenuses lie on the boundary). Therefore, we conclude ( m = 1 ), meaning the maximum hypotenuse lies on the boundary. 7. **Conclusion Based on Hypotenuse Position:** Given ( m = 1 ), and noting that the highest hypotenuse and its corresponding right angle must lie on opposite sides of the rectangle, the height of any resulting right triangle would not exceed half of its hypotenuse. 8. **Ratio Verification:** We must now calculate and prove the critical ratio of the sides. By geometric properties of right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem, we know that the longer side must be at least twice the length of the shorter side to satisfy the problem constraints. Thus, the final ratio is confirmed to be: (boxed{2}) This completes the proof that the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side of the rectangle is at least 2.

Consider a sphere with center ( O ) and radius ( R ), and a straight line ( l ) that we use to define our intersecting planes. 1. **Case 1: Line ( l ) intersects the sphere** - When ( l ) intersects the sphere, there is a common point between the line and the sphere. - Any plane passing through ( l ) that intersects the sphere will cut a circle out of the sphere. The center of this circle lies on the line through the center of the sphere ( O ) and the point where the plane intersects the sphere. - All these circle centers will collectively form another circle lying in the plane perpendicular to ( l ) and passing through the center of the sphere ( O ). 2. **Case 2: Line ( l ) is tangent to the sphere** - When ( l ) is tangent to the sphere, it touches the sphere at exactly one point. - At the point of tangency, any plane through ( l ) will form a circle that touches the sphere at the point of tangency and lies in the tangent plane at that point. - The centers of all such circles will lie on a circle in a plane perpendicular to ( l ), but not including the point of tangency, forming a circle with one missing point. 3. **Case 3: Line ( l ) does not intersect the sphere** - When ( l ) does not intersect the sphere, it means the line lies entirely outside the sphere. - Any plane containing ( l ) that intersects the sphere will form a circle with centers forming an arc in a plane perpendicular to ( l ). - The ends of this arc represent the points of tangency of the planes that are the boundary cases where the plane just touches the sphere. To summarize the collective formations: - When the line intersects the sphere, the circle centers form a complete circle inside the sphere. - When the line is tangent to the sphere, the centers form a circle missing one point. - When the line does not intersect the sphere, the centers form an arc. Thus, the centers of the circles formed by the intersection of the sphere with planes passing through the given line ( l ) can form: - A complete circle, - A circle missing one point, - An arc of a circle.

From the information given, we know that: 1. Melony makes 21 of profit every time she sells a certain number of shirts. So, S = 21. 2. She makes four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals. So, 2P = 4S. Since we know S = 21, we can say 2P = 4 * 21 = 84. Therefore, P = 84 / 2 = 42. Now, we are told that she will make 175 if she sells 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals. We can set up the equation: 7S + 3P = 175 We already know that S = 21 and P = 42, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 7 * 21 + 3 * 42 = 175 147 + 126 = 175 This equation does not hold true because 147 + 126 equals 273, not 175.

Thus: [ B_{100} = B_{99} = ldots = B_2 = B_1 = 2 ] Step 5: Sum the evaluated terms and find the integer part Now, we have: [ sqrt{6} + sqrt[3]{6} < A + B < 3 + 2 = 5 ] Since: [ sqrt{6} + sqrt[3]{6} > 4 ] Thus, the integer part of ( A + B ) is 4. # Conclusion: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=x^{2}tx1.<br/>(Ⅰ) If for any xin R, f(2x)=f(2+x), find the analytical expression of f(x);<br/>(Ⅱ) If the function is not monotonic on the interval (1,2), find the range of real number t;<br/>(Ⅲ) If xin [1,2], find the minimum value g(t) of f(x).","output":"# Solution Part (Ⅰ) Given that for any x in mathbb{R}, we have f(2-x)=f(2+x).

For the function f(x) to be non-monotonic on the interval (-1,2), the axis of symmetry must lie within this interval, that is: [ -1 < frac{t}{2} < 2 ] Solving for t gives us the inequality: [ -2 < t < 4 ] Hence, the range of t is t in (-2, 4). Part (Ⅲ) Considering the three cases based on the position of the axis of symmetry: 1. When frac{t}{2} leq -1, i.e., t leq -2, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on [-1,2], so the minimum value occurs at x=-1: [ g(t) = f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 ] 2.

When frac{t}{2} geq 2, i.e., t geq 4, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [-1,2], so the minimum value occurs at x=2: [ g(t) = f(2) = 2^2 - 4(2) - 1 = 4 - 8 - 1 = -5 ] Therefore, summarizing g(t) depending on the value of t: [ g(t) = left{begin{array}{ll} 3, & text{for } t leq -2 frac{t^2}{4} - 2t - 1, & text{for } -2 < t < 4 -5, & text{for } t geq 4 end{array}right. ] However, I realize there might have been a mistake in my step-by-step analysis for part (Ⅲ), as the original solution's expressions for g(t) were different.

We need to prove that (S_{2n} + 1) is not divisible by 3. 3. By definition, (S_n) is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of ((1+x)^n). The coefficients of ((1+x)^n) are given by the binomial coefficients (binom{n}{k}) for (k = 0, 1, ldots, n). Therefore, [ S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k}^2. ] 4. Using the identity for the sum of the squares of binomial coefficients, we have: [ S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k}^2 = binom{2n}{n}. ] 5. Therefore, (S_{2n} = binom{4n}{2n}). We need to show that (S_{2n} + 1 = binom{4n}{2n} + 1) is not divisible by 3. 6. We use a lemma related to binomial coefficients modulo a prime (p): [ text{Lemma: If } binom{2x}{x} text{ is not divisible by } p, text{ and } x = (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_t)_p text{ (base } p text{ representation)}, text{ then } 0 leq a_i leq frac{p-1}{2}. ] 7. Applying this lemma with (p = 3), we consider (2n) in base 3 representation. Let (2n = (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_t)_3) where (a_i in {0, 1}). 8. By the lemma, if (binom{4n}{2n}) is not divisible by 3, then the sum of the digits (a_i) in the base 3 representation of (2n) must be even. This is because each (a_i) can only be 0 or 1, and the sum of an even number of 1's is even. 9. Suppose for contradiction that (binom{4n}{2n} equiv -1 pmod{3}). Then: [ binom{4n}{2n} = sum_{i=0}^{t} binom{2a_i}{a_i} pmod{3}. ] Notice that each term (binom{2a_i}{a_i}) is 1 if (a_i = 0) and -1 if (a_i = 1). 10. For (binom{4n}{2n}) to be (-1 pmod{3}), there must be an odd number of (a_i) equal to 1. However, this implies that the sum of the digits (a_i) in the base 3 representation of (2n) is odd. 11. But (2n = a_0 + a_1 cdot 3 + ldots + a_t cdot 3^t) is even, which contradicts the fact that the sum of the digits (a_i) is odd. 12. Therefore, (binom{4n}{2n} equiv 1 pmod{3}), and hence (S_{2n} + 1 = binom{4n}{2n} + 1 equiv 2 pmod{3}), which is not divisible by 3.

Let’s analyze the numbering of cells within any 105 times 105 big square: - There are 25 numbered cells within each big square because each small square contains one numbered cell. Since each small square of size 21 times 21 contains at least one cell numbered, the minimum number of cells in each big square is 25. 7. Now, considering the numbers differ by more than 23.

Thus, we can compare the values of g(x) at specific points: gleft(frac{pi}{3}right) < gleft(frac{pi}{2}right) < gleft(frac{7pi}{6}right) = gleft(frac{5pi}{6}right). Recall the constants: a = frac{1}{2}fleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{1}{2}gleft(frac{pi}{3}right), b = 0, c = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}fleft(frac{7pi}{6}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}gleft(frac{7pi}{6}right).

So, 525 ÷ 3 = 175 and 999 ÷ 3 = 333. Now we have the simplified fraction: 175/333. This fraction cannot be simplified further since 175 and 333 have no common factors other than 1. To find the decimal equivalent of 175/333, we can perform long division. However, since you're interested in the 81st digit to the right of the decimal point, we can infer some properties of repeating decimals. When you divide a number by 333, the decimal will repeat every 3 digits because 333 is a repunit (a number consisting of repeated units) of 3s. This means that the decimal expansion of 175/333 will have a repeating cycle of 3 digits. Let's find the first few digits of the decimal expansion: 175 ÷ 333 = 0.525525525... As you can see, the decimal repeats every 3 digits with the pattern \\"525\\". Since the pattern repeats every 3 digits, to find the 81st digit, we can divide 81 by 3. 81 ÷ 3 = 27, which means that the 81st digit is the last digit in the 27th repetition of \\"525\\".

There are five toppings that she can put on the pizza. However, Arno is very picky and only likes some subset of the five toppings.

Purineqa chooses these pizzas such that no matter which toppings Arno likes, she has enough information to make him a sixth pizza with all the toppings he likes and no others. What are all possible combinations of the five initial pizzas for this to be the case?","output":"To determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for Purineqa to deduce Arno's preferences based on the given constraints, we will analyze the problem step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - Purineqa has 5 toppings available, which we will denote as ( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5 ). - Arno will respond with \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" to whether the pizza contains any topping that he does not like. - Purineqa aims to determine the exact subset of toppings that Arno likes after his responses to 5 pizzas. - Each pizza must be designed to give sufficient information about Arno's preferences. 2. **Key Insight:** - For Purineqa to be able to identify exactly which toppings Arno likes and dislikes, it is necessary for each possible topping to be testable independently of the others. 3. **Constructing the Pizzas:** - Consider each pizza to have **exactly one topping**. This means Pizza 1 has topping ( T_1 ), Pizza 2 has topping ( T_2 ), and so on up to Pizza 5 which has topping ( T_5 ). 4. **Analyzing Responses:** - If a pizza with topping ( T_i ) receives a \\"yes\\" response from Arno, it indicates that Arno likes ( T_i ). - Conversely, a \\"no\\" response indicates that Arno dislikes ( T_i ). 5. **Verification with Different Combinations:** - Assume Arno likes no toppings. He will respond \\"no\\" to all pizzas, enabling Purineqa to know that no toppings are preferred. - Assume Arno likes exactly one topping, say ( T_j ). He will respond \\"no\\" to all pizzas except the one with ( T_j ). 6. **Conclusion:** - No other combinations of pizzas can guarantee this level of discernment because any pizza with a combination of more than one topping would create ambiguity. For example, if a pizza had ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) and received a \\"no\\" from Arno, it is unclear which of ( T_1 ) or ( T_2 ) (or both) is disliked. 7. **Final Answer:** - Therefore, the only combinations of the five initial pizzas that ensure Purineqa can determine Arno's preferences are pizzas that each contain exactly one of the five toppings. (boxed{text{Each of the five pizzas should have exactly one unique topping from } {T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5}.}) By ensuring no topping is repeated and each topping is tested independently, Purineqa can deduce Arno's complete preference profile accurately."},{"instruction":"The sides of a triangle are 3, sqrt{8}, and 2 + sqrt{2}.

If we start with number ( N ), at each step, we sum the rearranged groups' numbers. - Given ( N ), if we split into ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( N_1 = a + b ): - For instance, if ( N ) has digits (6, 4), they can be grouped into ( 6 ) and ( 4 ) to form ( a = 6 ) and ( b = 4 ), with ( N_1 = 6 + 4 = 10 ). - In the next step, splitting digits (1, 0) (ignoring 0) reduces it to just 1. 4. **Mathematical proof with maximum operations:** - Let’s recursively consider operations: - Initially, ( N ): n digits. - After the first operation ( N_1 ), we get a sum. - Continuing this, ( N_2 ) is derived similarly until ( N_{15} ). 5. **Estimation using properties of decimal and logarithmic reduction:** - As each step consists of rearrangement and summation, a process of reducing a 10+ digit number to a one-digit number is estimated using principles of reduction like ( P = 0.5 times N ): - If the input ( N = 10^{15} ), the number reduces rapidly: - First, ( 10^{15} rightarrow 0.5 times 10^{15+1} = 5times 10^{14} ) - Second, iterating similarly yielding a reduction of ~97% at each step. 6. **Sum of digits modulo 9 property:** - The sum of digits of any number ( N) modulo 9 is invariant. - With continued summing, (| sum a_i leq 10 - 1 = 9| ), leveraging the modular reduction rules, within 15 steps, leads invariably to a single-digit outcome. # Conclusion: After repetitive steps, confirmably within the constraints of 15 operations, the input number will reduce to a one-digit number.

Now consider two convex polygons with ( k+1 ) sides, denoted as ( A_1A_2A_3 ldots A_{k+1} ) and ( B_1B_2B_3 ldots B_{k+1} ). By the problem conditions: [ A_1A_2 = B_1B_2, , A_2A_3 = B_2B_3, , ldots, , A_{k+1}A_1 = B_{k+1}B_1, ] and ( k-2 ) corresponding angles are equal between the two polygons. 3. **Reduction to Smaller Polygons:** Consider a pair of corresponding angles in these polygons that are equal, say ( angle A_1A_2A_3 = angle B_1B_2B_3 ). Remove ( A_3 ) from ( A_1A_2A_3 ldots A_{k+1} ) and ( B_3 ) from ( B_1B_2B_3 ldots B_{k+1} ). This operation reduces the polygons to two ( k )-sided convex polygons ( A_1A_2A_4 ldots A_{k+1} ) and ( B_1B_2B_4 ldots B_{k+1} ). 4. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis:** The remaining polygons ( A_1A_2A_4 ldots A_{k+1} ) and ( B_1B_2B_4 ldots B_{k+1} ) still have corresponding sides ( A_iA_{i+1} = B_iB_{i+1} ) (for ( i = 1,2,ldots,k )) and ( k-3 ) corresponding angles equal. By the inductive hypothesis, these two polygons are identical. Hence, upon re-adding the triangles ( A_1A_2A_3 ) and ( B_1B_2B_3 ) respectively, the original polygons ( A_1A_2A_3 ldots A_{k+1} ) and ( B_1B_2B_3 ldots B_{k+1} ) are also identical. # Conclusion: By mathematical induction, the given two convex polygons with equal corresponding sides and ( n-3 ) equal corresponding angles are congruent.

Each diameter is divided into 4 equal parts, creating 9 planes intersecting the sphere. These planes will intersect in circles on the sphere’s surface. 3. **Effect of each set of planes:** - Each of the three diameters creates three planes dividing the sphere into 8 regions along each individual diameter. - Due to the symmetry of the configuration, each intersection circle (focusing on equidistant points along a diameter) will intricate hemispheres and further sub-divide as each set of planes intersects. 4. **Detailed Analysis via spherical triangles and projections:** - The planes through the diameter create latitudinal circles at 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4 distances along each diameter. - Each latitude circle will intersect the remaining hemisphere’s great circle planes, culminating in 9 great circles on the sphere, equidistantly spaced partitions. 5. **Calculation of subdivisions:** - Consider the great circles slicing through each sector of the sphere - at each projection intersection, each new cross-section will divide space. - Initially, a great circle divides the surface into 2 parts. - Adding another will intersect each part into smaller segments, with every hemispherical layering. 6. **Counting the final parts:** - For each spherical segment, we start with 8 base segments due to perpendicular tri-diametric intersection. - Each new subset planes across aforementioned great circles will fraction the primary hemispherical interiors consistent with segmentation tools. - Empirically establishing each section’s interactive further partitioning into internal sqrt of each new segment intersections, results cumulatively.

For x = 1, we have f(1) = 1^{2} + 1 = 2. Therefore, f(-1) = -f(1) = -2. This shows that statement A is correct. **Statement B: f(x) is an increasing function** For x > 0, f(x) = x^{2} + x is clearly increasing because both x^2 and x increase as x increases. For x < 0, since f(x) is odd, f(-x) = -f(x). Thus, f(x) = -(-x^2 - x) = x^2 + x for x < 0, which was incorrectly stated in the standard solution. The correct expression derived from the odd function property should be f(x) = -x^2 + x for x < 0. However, considering the odd function property and the continuous nature of f(x) at x = 0, we examine the monotonicity over the entire domain mathbb{R}. The error in the standard solution's derivation for x < 0 does not affect the overall conclusion about the function's increasing nature due to the misunderstanding of the function's behavior for x < 0. The correct analysis should note that the function's behavior for x < 0 needs to be directly derived from the odd function property, leading to a misunderstanding in the explanation. However, the conclusion that f(x) is increasing over mathbb{R} is to be re-evaluated correctly. **Statement C: The solution set of the inequality f(frac{1}{x-1}) > f(-x) is (1, +infty)** Given f(frac{1}{x-1}) > f(-x), we substitute f(x) for the positive case, leading to frac{1}{x-1} + (frac{1}{x-1})^2 > -x^2 - x. This approach, however, does not directly apply since f(x) for x leq 0 was incorrectly stated in the solution. The correct approach involves understanding the behavior of f(x) for x > 0 and using the property of odd functions for x < 0. The inequality simplifies under the correct interpretation of f(x) for all x, but the direct comparison as given in the standard solution is flawed due to the incorrect expression for f(x) for x < 0. The correct analysis should reconsider the function's definition for x leq 0. **Statement D: When x leqslant 0, f(x) = x^{2} + x** This is incorrect because, for an odd function, the correct form when x leq 0 should be derived from the property f(-x) = -f(x). Given f(x) = x^2 + x for x > 0, the correct form for x leq 0 should reflect the odd function's symmetry, which contradicts the statement that f(x) = x^2 + x for x leq 0. The error in the standard solution's statement about f(x) for x < 0 leads to confusion, but the conclusion that statement D is incorrect stands due to the misunderstanding of the odd function's properties.

We connect some pairs of these points with line segments and color n^2 + 1 of these segments red. We are required to prove that there exists at least n triangles (among the 2n points) where all three sides are red. Step 2: Counting Red Segments and Degree Sum Firstly, denote the degree of vertex ( v_i ) by ( d(v_i) ). The degree ( d(v_i) ) represents the number of red segments incident to ( v_i ). We then have: [ sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} d(v_i) = 2(n^2 + 1) tag{1} ] because each red segment is counted twice when summing up the degrees.

We need to determine the number of dots on the four left faces shown in the figure. To facilitate this, we will label the faces of each cube based on the number of dots they have. 2. **Understanding Cube Geometry**: A cube consists of 6 faces. Given the markings: - The face with 1 dot is adjacent to the faces with 2, 3, 4, and 5 dots. - Opposite the face with 1 dot is the face with 6 dots. - Hence, the face with 2 dots is opposite the face with 5 dots, and the face with 3 dots is opposite the face with 4 dots. 3. **Analyzing the Figure**: From the figure, identify the faces that are part of the four adjacent cubes but are left visible: - The leftmost face in the figure is labeled as (A). - The next one on the adjacent face in the sequence as (B). - The third face in sequence is (C). - The last face in the sequence is (D). 4. **Calculate Dots on Face (A)**: - To determine which face corresponds to (A), consider its relative position in relation to other faces. - According to the geometry deduced, identify that the face visible (labeled (A)) corresponds to the face with 3 dots based on the relative placement and adjacency stipulated above. - Thus, the count on face (A) is (3). 5. **Calculate Dots on Face (B)**: - Following a similar analysis, determine that face (B) is the one showcasing 5 dots as per the described cube formation. - Thus, the count on face (B) is (5). 6. **Calculate Dots on Face (C)**: - Face (C) is the one opposite to other already identified faces and should clearly represent the 6-dot face. - Hence, the count on face (C) is (6). 7. **Calculate Dots on Face (D)**: - Using similar positional deduction for (D), this should correspond to the face with 5 dots, as calculated from the remaining available faces not yet identified. - Thus, the count on face (D) is (5). # Conclusion: From combining all sequential calculations based on the cube's geometry and configuration viewed from the image, we have: - The number of dots on face (A) is (3). - The number of dots on face (B) is (5). - The number of dots on face (C) is (6). - The number of dots on face (D) is (5).

Additionally, note that the digits that occupy even positions (from the right) in one number occupy odd positions in the other. 2. **Mutual Position Property:** It’s essential to note that vertex digits of friendly numbers cannot coincide because they would occupy different positional parities (even or odd places). 3. **Pair Formation:** Consequently, every mountainous number forms a unique pair with a friendly number, leading to pairs of mutual numbers. 4. **Digit Sums in Friendly Numbers:** Let’s denote the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and even positions for one number in a friendly pair as ( a ). For the other number, this difference will naturally be ( -a ) because reversing the digits reverses the positions of odd and even places. 5. **Modulo 11 Difference:** Differences in sums of digits in odd and even positions modulo 11 yield the same remainders as the numbers themselves due to the nature of the reversal. Consequently, the sum of these friendly numbers is divisible by 11.

(2) Now, let's find the value of g(alpha). g(alpha) = frac{sin (pi+alpha)+4cos (2pi+alpha)}{sin ( frac{pi}{2}-alpha)-4sin (-alpha)} Using the trigonometric identities sin(pi + alpha) = -sinalpha, cos(2pi + alpha) = cosalpha, and sin(-alpha) = -sinalpha, we can simplify the equation as follows: g(alpha) = frac{-sinalpha + 4cosalpha}{sin(frac{pi}{2} - alpha) + 4sinalpha} Now, we can rewrite sin(frac{pi}{2} - alpha) as cosalpha using the cofunction identity. g(alpha) = frac{-sinalpha + 4cosalpha}{cosalpha + 4sinalpha} Dividing both the numerator and denominator by cosalpha, we get: g(alpha) = frac{-tanalpha + 4}{1 + 4tanalpha} Substituting the value of tanalpha = -3 into the equation, we get: g(alpha) = frac{-(-3) + 4}{1 + 4(-3)} = frac{7}{-11} Hence, the value of g(alpha) is boxed{g(alpha) = -frac{7}{11}}."},{"instruction":"Given that M is a point inside triangle ABC, and overrightarrow {AB} cdot overrightarrow {AC} = 2 sqrt {3}, angle BAC = 30^circ.

She then asked those who like chocolate ice cream to raise their hands, and 5 gnomes raised their hands. 5. Lastly, for those who like fruit ice cream, only 1 gnome raised their hand. We need to determine how many of the gnomes are truthful. # Calculation Let's calculate the total number of hand-raises: - For cream ice cream, all 10 gnomes raised their hands. - For chocolate ice cream, 5 gnomes raised their hands. - For fruit ice cream, 1 gnome raised their hand. Thus, the total number of hand-raises is: [ 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 ] Now, if all gnomes were truthful: - Each gnome would only raise their hand once for the ice cream they actually like. - So, if all were truthful, there would have been exactly 10 hand-raises (one per gnome). The discrepancy here is that we observed 16 hand-raises, which is 6 more hand-raises than we would have if all were truthful. # Reasoning We establish that the gnomes who always lie would raise their hands for two types of ice cream they do not like. Therefore: - Each truthful gnome raises their hand exactly once. - Each lying gnome raises their hand exactly twice. Let's denote the number of truthful gnomes by ( T ) and the number of lying gnomes by ( L ).

Let's go through both of them in detail. I. Solution 1. **Rewrite the Expression**: Notice that the expression can be written in two different ways by completing the square: [ n^2 - 19n + 89 = (n - 10)^2 + n - 11 ] and [ n^2 - 19n + 89 = (n - 9)^2 + 8 - n ] 2. **Analyze the Inequalities**: For ( n > 11 ), observe the comparison between ((n - 10)^2) and ((n - 9)^2): [ (n-10)^2 < n^2 - 19n + 89 < (n-9)^2 ] 3. **Conclusion**: Since ( n^{2} - 19 n + 89 ) is strictly between the squares of two consecutive integers, it cannot itself be a perfect square. Therefore, ( n^2 - 19n + 89 ) is not a perfect square for ( n > 11 ). ( blacksquare ) II. Solution 1. **Assume the Expression is a Perfect Square**: Suppose there exists an integer ( m ) such that [ n^2 - 19n + 89 = m^2 ] 2. **Multiply by 4 and Simplify**: Multiply both sides by 4: [ 4(n^2 - 19n + 89) = 4m^2 ] This simplifies to: [ 4n^2 - 76n + 356 = 4m^2 ] 3. **Complete the Square**: Completing the square on the left-hand side: [ (2n - 19)^2 - 5 = 4m^2 ] Thus: [ (2n - 19)^2 - (2m)^2 = 5 ] This can be factored using the difference of squares: [ (2n - 19 - 2m)(2n - 19 + 2m) = 5 ] 4. **Solve the Factored Equation**: Analyze all possible factorizations of 5: - If ( 2n - 19 - 2m = 1 ) and ( 2n - 19 + 2m = 5 ): [ begin{cases} 2n - 19 - 2m = 1 2n - 19 + 2m = 5 end{cases} ] Adding these equations: [ 4n - 38 = 6 implies 4n = 44 implies n = 11 ] - Similarly, if ( 2n - 19 - 2m = -1 ) and ( 2n - 19 + 2m = -5 ): [ begin{cases} 2n - 19 - 2m = -1 2n - 19 + 2m = -5 end{cases} ] Adding these equations: [ 4n - 38 = -6 implies 4n = 32 implies n = 8 ] 5. **Verify the Values**: - For ( n = 11 ): [ n^2 - 19n + 89 = 11^2 - 19 cdot 11 + 89 = 1 ] which is a perfect square. - For ( n = 8 ): [ n^2 - 19n + 89 = 8^2 - 19 cdot 8 + 89 = 1 ] which is also a perfect square. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( n^2 - 19n + 89 ) is a perfect square only for ( n = 8 ) and ( n = 11 ). For ( n > 11 ), the expression is not a perfect square.

Since each semicircle touches the triangle at points (V) and (W), and touches internally at point (U), angles (PVS) and (TWS) are right angles due to the tangent-segment property (a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency). 2. **Establish straight line and length relationship in semicircles:** The line (SUT) represents the line segment joining the centers (S) and (T) of the touching semicircles and passes through their point of contact (U).

Since the center of the circle is at (0,0), we need to find the distance of the origin from the line. The distance D from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by: D = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. In our case, (x_0, y_0) = (0,0) and our line is (a+2b)x+(b-a)y+a-b=0. Hence, A = a + 2b, B = b - a, and C = a - b. Plugging these into our distance formula: D = frac{|(a+2b) cdot 0 + (b-a) cdot 0 + (a-b)|}{sqrt{(a+2b)^2 + (b-a)^2}} = frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2 + b^2 - 2ab + a^2}} = frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab}}. Now, simplify the denominator: D = frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}} = frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{2} sqrt{(a + b)^2}} = frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{2} |a + b|} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}. The fact that the perpendicular distance D is constant (irrespective of a and b) and equals frac{1}{sqrt{2}} tells us that this is the shortest distance from the center of the circle to the line. For the line and the circle to have common points, the radius of the circle must be greater than or equal to this distance.

Initially, before any steps have been taken, we only have two numbers on the endpoints of a single diameter of the circle. We label these numbers as 1 and 1. Thus, at the initial state (step 0), the sum is: [ S_0 = 1 + 1 = 2. ] 2. In the first step, we divide the entire circle into two equal semicircles. Each semicircle is labeled with the sum of the numbers at its endpoints. Since the initial circle is divided into two, both semicircles are labeled with the sum 1+1: [ S_1 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. ] 3. Now, let's consider the pattern and derive a general rule. When we go from step k to step k+1, each number on the circle splits into two numbers. Each new number is the sum of two numbers from the previous step. Thus, each number on the circle at step k will appear twice in the calculations for step k+1. 4.

Step 1: Understand the base figure The base figure consists of 6 congruent squares arranged in a cross shape with one square at the center and the other five spreading outwards in each cardinal direction. Step 2: Visualize the folding into a cube A cube has 6 faces, each a square. To form a cube with one face missing using 7 squares, we need to arrange the figure such that when folded, no two squares overlap except at their edges. Step 3: Analyze each position for the additional square - **Central Square Extensions (Positions A1, A2, A3, A4)**: These positions expand directly from the sides of the central square. These positions generally do not interfere with forming the cube structure, as they can represent an outward-facing square in the cube. - **Outer Edge Positions (Positions B1, B2, C1, C2)**: These positions are at the tips of the cross. Adding a square here can potentially block the folding along the necessary edges to form a cube. - **Middle Edge Positions (Positions D1, D2, D3)**: These positions, being in the middle of the edges of the cross, allow for more flexibility. They are also likely viable as they help in creating an additional face while maintaining cube integrity. Step 4: Count the valid positions From the analysis, positions A1, A2, A3, A4, D1, D2, and D3 do not prevent the figure from being folded into a cube with one face missing.

Setting ( x = 2sintheta ) and ( y = costheta ), we have: [ z = 2sintheta + costheta i ] Thus, ( z + i = 2sintheta + (costheta + 1) i ). 3. **Calculate the magnitude ( |z + i| ):** [ |z + i| = |2sintheta + (costheta + 1)i| ] This magnitude is given by: [ |z + i| = sqrt{(2sintheta)^2 + (costheta + 1)^2} ] 4. **Expand and simplify the expression:** [ |z + i| = sqrt{4sin^2theta + (costheta + 1)^2} ] Expanding ( (costheta + 1)^2 ): [ (costheta + 1)^2 = cos^2theta + 2costheta + 1 ] Therefore: [ |z + i| = sqrt{4sin^2theta + cos^2theta + 2costheta + 1} ] 5. **Use the Pythagorean identity ( sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1 ):** [ = sqrt{4(1 - cos^2theta) + cos^2theta + 2costheta + 1} ] Simplifying inside the square root: [ = sqrt{4 - 4cos^2theta + cos^2theta + 2costheta + 1} = sqrt{5 - 3cos^2theta + 2costheta } ] 6. **Complete the square inside the square root:** [ 5 - 3cos^2theta + 2costheta = -3left(costheta - frac{1}{3}right)^2 + frac{16}{3} ] 7. **Take the maximum value of the quantity:** [ |z + i| = sqrt{-3left(costheta - frac{1}{3}right)^2 + frac{16}{3}} leq sqrt{frac{16}{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} ] Conclusion. The maximum value of ( |z + i| ) is (boxed{frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}})."},{"instruction":"Given a square pyramid (MABCD) with a square base such that (MA = MD), (MA perp AB), and the area of (triangle AMD) is 1, find the radius of the largest sphere that can fit into this square pyramid.","output":"1. **Understanding the Structure**: We have a square-based pyramid M-ABCD where the base is a square, and M is directly above the center of the square base.

Since we don't know the exact numbers, we can start by finding the difference between the largest and smallest possible numbers in the range that could be divisible by the same number. The smallest number divisible by a certain number greater than 39 could be 40 (if the certain number is 2 or a factor of 40), and the largest number less than 79 that is divisible by the same number could be 78 (if the certain number is 2 or a factor of 78).

The factors of 38 are 1, 2, 19, and 38. We can eliminate 1 because it's trivial (all numbers are divisible by 1). We can also eliminate 38 because there would not be four different numbers between 39 and 79 that are divisible by 38.

Let us show that this is indeed the case. (You can use the fact that in those isosceles triangles where the base angles are (36^circ) and (72^circ), the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is (frac{sqrt{5}+1}{2})). 1. **Introduction and Analysis of the Problem:** Observe that every internal dividing line of the large regular pentagon is parallel to one of the pentagon's sides. Considering that all internal angles of a regular pentagon are (108^circ), we can deduce the properties of the triangles formed by these divisions. 2. **Identifying Triangle Types:** - Triangles ( A ) and ( C ) have angles (72^circ), (72^circ), and (36^circ). - Triangles ( B ) and ( D ) have angles (36^circ), (36^circ), and (108^circ). This indicates that triangles ( A ) and ( C ) are isosceles with base angles (72^circ), and triangles ( B ) and ( D ) are also isosceles with base angles (36^circ). 3. **Dividing the Pentagon:** Each of the three small pentagons formed in the division of the large pentagon must also share internal angles of (108^circ). 4. **Considering Diagonals:** The upper and lower right ( B ) triangles have one side on one of the main diagonals of the pentagon. This diagonal splits the upper right small pentagon into a triangle similar to ( D ) and a symmetric trapezoid, confirming that the ( B ) triangles are congruent. 5. **Symmetric Division:** The dividing lines form a symmetric system relative to the vertical axis of the original pentagon. Each of the two upper small pentagons also exhibits vertical symmetry. Each side of the small pentagons has equal lengths due to their consistent angles and symmetric properties. - The base of triangles ( A ) and ( D ) as well as the sides of triangles ( B ) and ( C ) are equal to the sides of the smaller pentagons. - This confirms that each smaller pentagon formed is indeed a regular pentagon. 6. **Forming Congruent Triangle Groups:** For the composite small pentagon formed from (B)- and (A)-triangles: - This configuration ensures that each angle and side are congruent, leading it to form a regular pentagon. 7. **Final Analysis:** - Ensuring that the isolated lower small pentagon can be completely and without overlap formed from (C) and (D) triangles: - Considering the symmetrical and proportional properties, a horizontal line through the (B) triangle's (108^circ) vertex splits it into corresponding (C) and (D) triangles. - Each of these splits ensures that all parts sum to match the base lengths and symmetry needed to complete the regular pentagon. 8. **Conclusion:** Placing focus on the geometric symmetries and angle properties confirms that it is possible to divide a regular pentagon into five congruent smaller regular pentagons.

For the given function, y=x^2+2x+m, we can complete the square to find its vertex and axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry is at x=-b/2a. Here, a=1 and b=2, so the axis of symmetry is x=-2/2=-1. 2. **Position of Points Relative to Axis of Symmetry**: - The point A(-1,y_{1}) is exactly on the axis of symmetry. - The points (3,y_{2}) and left(frac{1}{2},y_{3}right) are to the right of the axis of symmetry. 3. **Direction of the Parabola**: Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. 4. **Comparing y Values**: - Since the parabola opens upwards and is symmetric about the line x=-1, the y value increases as we move away from the axis of symmetry on either side. - Given that 3 and frac{1}{2} are both to the right of -1, but 3 is further away, y_{2} (corresponding to x=3) will be greater than y_{3} (corresponding to x=frac{1}{2}). - Since y_{1} is on the axis of symmetry, it will have the lowest y value among the three points because the parabola opens upwards and away from this point.

Let's start by calculating the cost price for the retailer: The retailer buys 140 pens for the price of 36 pens. This means that for every 36 pens, the retailer gets 140 pens. So, the cost price per pen for the retailer is the price of 1 pen if he were to buy 36 pens at the regular price. Let's assume the market price of 1 pen is 1 (for simplicity, we'll use dollars, but the same logic applies to any currency). Then, the cost price for 36 pens would be 36 * 1 = 36. Since the retailer gets 140 pens for the price of 36 pens, the cost price for 140 pens is still 36. Now, let's calculate the selling price after the discount: The retailer sells the pens with a 1% discount. If the market price of 1 pen is 1, then the selling price of 1 pen after a 1% discount would be 1 - (1 * 1/100) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99. The selling price for 140 pens would be 140 * 0.99 = 138.60.

Therefore, the function simplifies to f(x) = x^3 + cx. The derivative f'(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = 3x^2 + c. Since f(x) has extreme values at x = pm 1, we have f'(-1) = 0 and f'(1) = 0. Thus, solving f'(1) = 3 times 1^2 + c = 0, we obtain c = -3. Hence, the explicit formula for f(x) is: [f(x) = x^3 - 3x] (2) To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [-1, m] for m > -1, we will consider different cases based on the value of m: - When -1 < m leq 1, f(x) is monotonic decreasing on the interval [-1, m]: The minimum value of f(x) is f_{min} = f(m) = m^3 - 3m, and the maximum value is f_{max} = f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) = 2.

Since (k+10)(k+11)(k+12) - k(k+1)(k+2) = 10M, it implies that (k+10)(k+11)(k+12) and k(k+1)(k+2) have the same units digit. 4. Therefore, we have (b_{k+10} = b_{k}). 5.

This happens when A and C are either both odd or both even (same parity). 2. **Counting Possibilities for A and C:** - A can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it's the first digit of a three-digit number), giving 9 possibilities. - C must have the same parity as A. There are 5 digits of the same parity as any given digit within the range 0 to 9 (including 0 for C but excluding it since C is the last digit of a three-digit number). Thus, there are 5 possibilities for C. 3. **Determining B:** For each pair (A, C), B is uniquely determined as frac{A + C}{2}. 4. **Total Count:** The total number of such numbers is the product of the possibilities for A and C, which is 9 times 5 = 45. Solution 2: Arithmetic Sequence Approach 1. **Arithmetic Sequence:** The digits A, B, C form an arithmetic sequence because B - A = C - B. 2. **Identical Digits:** If A = B = C, then there are 9 possibilities (111, 222, ..., 999). 3. **Different Digits - Increasing and Decreasing Sequences:** - **Common Differences:** The common differences can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since the digits are between 0 and 9). - **Counting Sequences for Each Difference:** - Difference of 1: Sequences are 012 to 789, giving 8 sequences. - Difference of 2: Sequences are 024 to 579, giving 6 sequences. - Difference of 3: Sequences are 036 to 369, giving 4 sequences. - Difference of 4: Sequences are 048 to 159, giving 2 sequences. - **Total Sequences:** 2(8 + 6 + 4 + 2) = 40 (multiplying by 2 to account for decreasing sequences). 4. **Adjusting for Three-Digit Numbers:** We subtract sequences starting with 0 (4 sequences) and add the 9 sequences where all digits are the same. 5. **Final Count:** 40 + 9 - 4 = 45.

Similarly, (Q(x) = 1) or (Q(x) = -1). 3. **Matching constants**: Since both (P(x)) and (Q(x)) must be integer polynomials, their leading coefficients must be 1 or -1.

When he swims upstream, his effective speed is his swimming speed minus the speed of the current (Vm - Vc). We know that the time taken to swim downstream and upstream is the same, which is 2 hours.

This cycle cannot contain two or more city vertices because moving in opposite directions along the cycle would provide two different paths between these cities, violating the problem's condition that there is only one way to travel between any two cities. - Hence, no cycles can exist in the graph, confirming it is a tree. 3. **Exploring the properties of a tree** - **Properties**: - A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. - In the given problem, we consider the vertices to include 100 cities plus potential junctions and crossroads. - **Leaf property**: - By definition, every leaf (end vertex) in the road network corresponds to a city. 4. **Measuring distances and constructing the edge lengths** - Since the task is to determine if the lengths of all edges in the graph can be determined using exactly 100 measurements, we must consider paths between specific cities (leaf nodes). - **Procedure**: - Start by picking any leaf, say city A_1, and measure the distance to the next leaf in a fixed direction using a consistent choice at each divergence (e.g., the rightmost path). - Measure the distance between this city and the next leaf city A_2, and then A_2 to A_3, and so on. 5. **Ensuring that all edges will be walked over twice**: - When measuring paths in this manner, the process will ensure that each road (edge in the tree) is traversed twice, once in each direction. - Suppose removing any road would split the tree into two connected components K_1 and K_2, with one containing cities and junctions. Traversing the tree requires checking all cities, ensuring each edge (road) will be measured twice (once while moving from K_1 to K_2 and once on the return). 6. **Deriving the total network length**: - By summing all measurements and then dividing by 2, one correctly accounts for each road being included exactly once in the total calculation: text{Total length of the network} = frac{sum text{measured distances}}{2} # Conclusion: Thus, it is indeed possible to confidently determine the total length of all roads in the network using exactly 100 measurements. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"last year elaine spent 20 % of her annual earnings on rent . this year she earned 15 % more than last year and she spent 25 % of her annual earnings on rent . the amount she spent on rent this year is what percent of the amount spent on rent last year ?","output":"Let's assume Elaine's annual earnings last year were ( E ) dollars.

So the formula for the circumference of a semicircle is: Circumference of semicircle = (π * diameter) / 2 + diameter Using the diameter of 28 cm, we get: Circumference of semicircle = (π * 28 cm) / 2 + 28 cm Circumference of semicircle = (π * 14 cm) + 28 cm Now, let's use the value of π as approximately 3.14 to calculate the circumference: Circumference of semicircle = (3.14 * 14 cm) + 28 cm Circumference of semicircle = 43.96 cm + 28 cm Circumference of semicircle = 71.96 cm Rounded off to two decimal places, the circumference of the semicircle is boxed{71.96} cm."},{"instruction":"Construct the notable points of a triangle when the vertices are inaccessible.","output":"To construct the notable points of a triangle when the vertices are inaccessible, one can follow these steps: 1. **Determine the Circumcenter**: - The circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect. Let's denote the triangle as ( triangle ABC ). - Despite not being able to directly access the vertices, one can use the midpoint of each side. - Suppose we can measure the lengths of the segments ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ). We can then find the midpoints ( M_{AB}, M_{BC}, ) and ( M_{CA} ). - Construct the perpendicular bisectors of each side using the midpoints. - The intersection of these perpendicular bisectors is the circumcenter ( O ). 2. **Determine the Incenter**: - The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. - If the vertices are inaccessible, find the midpoints of the sides as in the previous step. - Then, using a compass and a straightedge, construct the angle bisectors from these midpoints. - Where these angle bisectors intersect is the incenter ( I ). 3. **Determine the Centroid**: - The centroid is the point where the medians of the triangle intersect. - A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. - Even if vertices are inaccessible, midpoints can be used to extrapolate the likely centroids’ coordinates. - Find the midpoints ( M_{AB}, M_{BC}, ) and ( M_{CA} ). - Draw the medians from these midpoints. - The intersection point of these medians is the centroid ( G ). 4. **Determine the Orthocenter**: - The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes intersect. - An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side. - Even though we cannot access vertices, we can use known lengths and approximate angles to estimate the orthocenter. - Assume the midpoint of each side is taken as noted, and approximations via circular arcs or iterative construction allows for altitudinal perceiving, leading to the orthocenter ( H ).

Chainlink fence costs 7 per linear foot 3. Iron fence costs 10 per linear foot You need to minimize the overall cost while meeting the area constraint. Determine the best combination of materials for the two shorter sides and the uncovered side which require fencing, and calculate the total cost of that fencing arrangement.","output":"To minimize the overall cost, we need to find the dimensions of the field that will require the least amount of fencing material while still having an area of 680 square feet. Let's denote the length of the uncovered side as L and the length of the other two sides that need to be fenced as W. We know that L = 34 feet. The area A of the rectangle is given by A = L * W. We can use this to find W: A = 680 sq. ft. L = 34 ft. W = A / L W = 680 sq. ft. / 34 ft. W = 20 ft. So, the dimensions of the field are 34 feet by 20 feet. The total length of fencing needed is the sum of the two widths and one length: Total fencing = 2W + L Total fencing = 2 * 20 ft. + 34 ft. Total fencing = 40 ft. + 34 ft. Total fencing = 74 ft. Now, we need to minimize the cost. We have three materials to choose from, and we should use the cheapest material for the longest part of the fence to minimize the cost. Since the two widths (W) are equal and shorter than the length (L), we should use the cheapest material for the two widths and the next cheapest for the length. The cheapest material is the wooden fence at 5 per linear foot, and the next cheapest is the chain-link fence at 7 per linear foot. We will use the wooden fence for the two widths (40 ft.) and the chain-link fence for the length (34 ft.). Cost of wooden fence for two widths = 2W * 5/ft. Cost of wooden fence for two widths = 2 * 20 ft. * 5/ft. Cost of wooden fence for two widths = 40 ft. * 5/ft. Cost of wooden fence for two widths = 200 Cost of chain-link fence for length = L * 7/ft. Cost of chain-link fence for length = 34 ft. * 7/ft.

We start by analyzing the given function phi(n), which denotes the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. We need to find the maximum value of phi(n^2 + 2n) - phi(n^2) for 1 leq n leq 100. 2. First, recall that phi(n^2) = n phi(n) for any integer n. This is because the Euler's totient function phi is multiplicative and n^2 can be factored as n cdot n. 3. Consider the expression phi(n^2 + 2n) - phi(n^2). We can rewrite n^2 + 2n as n(n + 2). Thus, the expression becomes: [ phi(n(n + 2)) - phi(n^2) ] Using the multiplicative property of phi, we have: [ phi(n(n + 2)) = phi(n) phi(n + 2) cdot frac{n(n + 2)}{gcd(n, n + 2)} ] Since gcd(n, n + 2) = 1 for odd n and gcd(n, n + 2) = 2 for even n, we need to consider these cases separately. 4. **Case 1: n is odd.** [ phi(n(n + 2)) = phi(n) phi(n + 2) ] Therefore, the expression becomes: [ phi(n(n + 2)) - phi(n^2) = phi(n) phi(n + 2) - n phi(n) = phi(n) (phi(n + 2) - n) ] For this to be maximized, phi(n + 2) should be as large as possible. If n + 2 is a prime number p, then phi(p) = p - 1. Thus, we need to find the maximum value of phi(n) for n = p - 2 where p is a prime number less than or equal to 102. 5. **Case 2: n is even.** [ phi(n(n + 2)) = phi(n) phi(n + 2) cdot 2 ] Therefore, the expression becomes: [ phi(n(n + 2)) - phi(n^2) = 2 phi(n) phi(n + 2) - n phi(n) = phi(n) (2 phi(n + 2) - n) ] For this to be maximized, 2 phi(n + 2) should be as large as possible. If n + 2 is a power of 2, then phi(n + 2) = n + 1. Thus, we need to find the maximum value of 2 phi(n) for n = 2^k - 2 where 2^k - 2 leq 100. 6. We now compute phi(n) for various values of n: - For n = 95, n + 2 = 97 (a prime), phi(95) = 72. - For n = 99, n + 2 = 101 (a prime), phi(99) = 60. - For n = 87, n + 2 = 89 (a prime), phi(87) = 56. - For n = 81, n + 2 = 83 (a prime), phi(81) = 54. - For n = 77, n + 2 = 79 (a prime), phi(77) = 60. 7. Comparing these values, the maximum value of phi(n) for odd n is phi(95) = 72. 8. For even n, the maximum value of 2 phi(n) is 2 phi(62) = 60, which is not larger than 72.

We need to find the largest possible common divisor (length) less than 45 for the numbers within the range 2011 to 2019. We systematically check each number or consider properties of divisors near ( sqrt{2020} ). 6. Checking known properties for divisors within this range, we find: (-) Numbers beyond the range such as 2024 and 2021 are not suitable as their simplified products exceed 2019. (-) By calculations and verifying possible pairings, 2016 is divisible by 42 and 42 appears to be an optimal dimension length. 7.

Prove that it is possible to cut out a fourcell figure of the shape square (which may be rotated) from the remaining part. (If such a figure already exists among the remaining parts, it is considered that it was successfully cut out.)","output":"Consider a 100 times 100 grid. We need to demonstrate that, despite removing 1950 dominoes (each domino covering 2 cells), we can always find a 2 times 2 sub-grid (possibly rotated) among the remaining cells. We will explore this by examining various properties and systematically analyzing them. Initial Setup: 1. **Initial number of cells:** [ N_{text{initial}} = 100 times 100 = 10000 text{ cells} ] 2. **Cells covered by 1950 dominoes:** [ N_{text{covered}} = 1950 times 2 = 3900 text{ cells} ] 3. **Remaining cells:** [ N_{text{remaining}} = N_{text{initial}} - N_{text{covered}} = 10000 - 3900 = 6100 text{ cells} ] Next, let's examine some key properties and steps. Details of Domino Removal and Remaining Cells: 4. **Adjacent cells concept (price):** Let the *price* of a cell be the number of adjacent cells that have not been removed, divided by 2. For a cell c_i, we denote the initial price as p(c_i). - A corner cell has 2 times frac{1}{2} = 1 (it has 1 neighbor) - An edge cell (not at the corner) has 1 times 2 = 2 - 2cdotfrac{1}{2}=1 (it potentially has 2 neighbors as initial edges) - An internal cell has 2 times frac{4}{2} = 4 (4 neighbors) 5. **Initial total price:** [ S_{text{initial}} = sum_{i=1}^{10000} p(c_i) = 2 times 100^2 - 400 = 19600 ] - Explanation: Each cell contributes initially 2 to the price except for boundary adjustments. Analyzing Price Changes: 6. Each domino removal: - Removes 2 cells, max reduction in price = 4 (in case of internal cells) - Reduces prices of up to 6 adjacent cells by 1 each - Thus, total price reduction at most: [ D_{text{domino}} = 2 cdot 2 + 6 cdot 1 = 10 ] 7. **Overall price reduction for 1950 dominoes:** [ S_{text{remaining}} >= 19600 - 1950 times 10 = 19600 - 19500 = 100 ] This indicates there is an unavoidable price remaindering in the arrangement. 8. **Critical Observation:** - If there remains any cell c_k with ( p(c_k) > 0 ), it must be adjacent to at least 3 non-removed cells (remaining or not yet processed). - This necessarily forms at least one possible 2 times 2 sub-grid or a square tetromino including that cell and its neighbors. # Conclusion: Therefore, in the remaining cells, by evaluating individual grid cells' prices and their corresponding neighbor cells' price interactions. We find guaranteed cells forming a 2 times 2 block after cutting out the 1950 dominoes. Hence, it’s possible to extract the desired shape from the remaining sections.

We need to determine the minimum number of odd numbers in the set ( A_P ), given that the number 8 is present in the set. 3. The set ( A_P ) is defined as the set of all numbers x for which P(x) gives a certain value. 4. Consider a polynomial P of degree 8. 5. A polynomial of degree 8 has at most 8 real roots and can be written in the form: [ P(x) = a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ] 6. Polynomials of even degree have an even number of transformations over the total degree range from negative to positive infinity. 7. If we consider the monotonicity changes of the polynomial P, a polynomial of degree 8 can have up to 7 changes in monotonicity (local maxima and minima), each a point where the polynomial crosses a certain value. 8. Specifically, the polynomial can cross the c value at most 8 times, where these values correspond to the roots of the polynomial equation P(x) = c. 9. Let's introduce notation: Let ( B_c ) represent the set of points ( x ) at which ( P(x) = c ), and the polynomial changes its monotonicity at these points. 10. Since the degree of the polynomial is 8, it is a symmetric function about some central point (or set of points), and thus ( |B(c)| ) will be an even number unless we specifically construct it such that it doesn't cover all symmetries. 11. If any polynomial crosses the number 8, as mentioned in the problem, it must include odd changes given that a polynomial seeking an unbalanced approach (unevenly distributed transformations) brings in at least one unchangeable odd point. 12. Demonstrate by Example: - Consider the polynomial: [ P(x) = (x - 3)^2 (x - 1)^2 (x + 1)^2 (x + 3)^2 ] This is an even polynomial and should handle symmetry in crossings ideally. 13. For c not equal to P(0), l_P(c) (where ((x-0)) is at zero values), depending on how it is structured, will likely be even, but in a case that the point value generates an unbalance—it includes odd changes in monotonicity—we recognize: Therefore, it must include a minimum of at least one odd transformation.

Therefore, f(x) takes its minimum value when x = frac{m}{2}. Thus, we have: f(frac{m}{2}) = -frac{m^2}{4}. When m = 4, we find that frac{m}{2} = 2, and f(x) is decreasing on the entire interval [0,2]. Hence, at the endpoint x = 2, f(x) takes its minimum value: f(2) = f(frac{m}{2}) = -frac{4^2}{4} = -4.

Factors on the right-hand side ((b_1 - a_i)) are integers that are pairwise different and non-zero. Since 3 is a prime, the multiplicative combination on the right-hand side must employ integers whose product equals 3.

Similarly, we achieve this by finding height ( h_n ): [ A_{text{n-th triangle}} = frac{1}{n} A_{text{triangle}} ] Using similar triangles: [ left( frac{A_{text{n-th triangle}}}{A_{text{triangle}}} right) = left( frac{h_n}{h} right)^2 = frac{1}{n} ] Solving for ( h_n ): [ left( frac{h_n}{h} right)^2 = frac{1}{n} implies frac{h_n}{h} = frac{1}{sqrt{n}} implies h_n = frac{h}{sqrt{n}} ] So, the height of the ( n )-th part triangle is ( frac{h}{sqrt{n}} ). 4. **Finding Quadrilateral with Area Equal to n-th Part:** Finally, to find a quadrilateral with an area equal to ( frac{1}{n} ) of the given triangle, we first find the area that should be removed.

For this option, we notice that the terms are not exactly in the form of a square of a binomial because we have (x+y) and (-x+y). However, if we consider the distributive property and the fact that squaring involves multiplying an expression by itself, we can see that this option does not directly apply the square of a binomial formula due to the signs being different. Yet, it's close to a difference of squares, which is a related concept but not exactly what we're looking for. This analysis might seem to contradict the initial solution, but upon a closer inspection, it's acknowledged that this option was mistakenly identified as fitting the square of a binomial formula directly. The correct interpretation should focus on the presence of a binomial squared directly or the potential to rearrange it into such after simplification, which isn't straightforwardly the case here. **Option B: (2x-y)left(x+2yright)** This expression does not have the same terms in both binomials, and the coefficients are not positioned to suggest a direct square of a binomial.

This means that this option does meet the requirements, contrary to the initial solution provided. **Option D: (-2x+y)left(-2y-xright)** This expression does not fit the square of a binomial formula due to the different terms and the arrangement of coefficients.

By definition, 10^{k-1} leq 1974^n < 10^k. Given 1974^n > 1000^n = 10^{3n}, it is clear that k geq 3n. 3. Assume that the number of digits in 1974^n + 2^n is more than k. Then, we would have 1974^n + 2^n geq 10^k. 4. Notice that 1974^n can be factored as 2^n cdot 987^n. Therefore: [ 1974^n + 2^n = 2^n cdot 987^n + 2^n = 2^n (987^n + 1). ] 5. Using the inequality assumption 1974^n + 2^n geq 10^k, we substitute and simplify: [ 2^n (987^n + 1) geq 10^k. ] Thus, dividing both sides by 2^n results in: [ 987^n + 1 geq 2^{k-n} cdot 5^{k}. ] 6.

Considering k - n geq 3n - n = 2n, for n > 2, the term 2^{k-n} cdot 5^k must be divisible by 8 (or even 16). 8.

How many votes were casted for the winning candidate?","output":"Let's denote the total number of votes cast in the election as V. The winner received 62% of these votes, so the number of votes for the winner is 0.62V. The loser received the remaining 38% of the votes, so the number of votes for the loser is 0.38V. The winner won the election by 360 votes, which means the difference between the votes for the winner and the votes for the loser is 360 votes. So we can set up the following equation: 0.62V - 0.38V = 360 Combining like terms, we get: 0.24V = 360 To find V, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.24: V = 360 / 0.24 V = 1500 Now that we know the total number of votes V, we can calculate the number of votes for the winning candidate: Votes for the winning candidate = 0.62 * V Votes for the winning candidate = 0.62 * 1500 Votes for the winning candidate = 930 Therefore, the winning candidate received boxed{930} votes."},{"instruction":"Suppose 507cdot 873 equiv n pmod{77}, where 0 le n < 77.

For y=dfrac{1}{x}, we observe two properties: - Odd or Even: Since f(-x) = dfrac{1}{-x} neq -dfrac{1}{x} = -f(x) and f(-x) neq f(x), it does not satisfy the definition of an odd function specifically. However, this is not directly relevant to disproving it as an odd function, but it's important to note that it's not even. The critical point is its behavior on the positive side, which doesn't directly indicate its oddness. - Monotonicity: To check if it's monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right), we derive f'(x) = -dfrac{1}{x^2}. Since f'(x) < 0 for all x > 0, it is monotonically decreasing, not increasing. B. For y=|x|, we consider: - Odd or Even: Since f(-x) = |-x| = |x| = f(x), it is an even function, not an odd function. - Monotonicity: While it's monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right), its even nature disqualifies it. C. For y=2^{x}, we evaluate: - Odd or Even: Since there's no simple transformation that shows f(-x) = -f(x) or f(-x) = f(x) for all x, it's neither odd nor even. - Monotonicity: It is monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right), but its lack of oddness disqualifies it. D. For y=x^{3}, we assess: - Odd or Even: Since f(-x) = (-x)^3 = -x^3 = -f(x), it satisfies the condition for being an odd function. - Monotonicity: To confirm it's monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right), we derive f'(x) = 3x^2. Since f'(x) > 0 for all x > 0, it is monotonically increasing. Therefore, among the options given, only y=x^{3} is both an odd function and monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right).

The entire nation united to combat the disaster and aid in the relief efforts.   (1) Saving lives is the top priority. Many search and rescue dogs were deployed to find survivors buried under the rubble. Search and rescue dogs can locate survivors based on the scent emitted by the human body. From a microscopic perspective, the reason why search and rescue dogs can find survivors is:   A. Molecules are very small.   B. Different molecules have different properties.   C. Molecules are constantly in motion.   D. There are gaps between molecules.   (2) Many original water sources were destroyed in the earthquake. New water sources need to be tested and treated before they can be used as drinking water. In China, water quality must meet sensory indicators, chemical indicators, and pathological indicators to be considered potable water.   ① One of the sensory indicators requires that the water must not contain visible matter and should be clear and transparent. To achieve this requirement, water can be purified by adding flocculants to coagulate and settle, and then by (fill in the operation name).   ② The chemical indicators include the pH and hardness of the water source. The method to measure the pH of a liquid is:   How can hard water and soft water be distinguished in daily life? Please briefly describe the experimental steps and phenomena:   ③ The pathological indicators strictly limit the content of bacteria. To kill bacteria, disinfectants such as can be added to the water, or by (fill in the operation) to not only kill bacteria but also obtain almost pure water.

To prepare 300kg of a 0.5% peracetic acid solution, 10kg of a 15% peracetic acid solution is needed. The main steps of preparation are","output":"(1) The reason search and rescue dogs can find survivors is due to the constant motion of molecules and the properties of molecules. It is unrelated to the small mass of molecules or the gaps between them.   Therefore, the answer is: boxed{text{BC}};   (2) ① The method to measure the pH of a liquid is: Place dry pH paper on a glass slide, dip a glass rod into the liquid to be tested, touch it to the pH paper, and then compare it with a standard color chart;   Therefore, the answer is: Place dry pH paper on a glass slide, dip a glass rod into the liquid to be tested, touch it to the pH paper, and then compare it with a standard color chart;   ② Hard water contains high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It can be identified with soap water. If a large amount of precipitate is produced, it is hard water. Thus, the experimental steps and phenomena are: Take a small sample in a test tube, add soap water and shake. If a lot of precipitates appear, it is hard water; otherwise, it is soft water;   Therefore, the answer is: Take a small sample in a test tube, add soap water and shake. If a lot of precipitates appear, it is hard water; otherwise, it is soft water;   ③ Substances with strong oxidizing properties can denature proteins and can be used as disinfectants, such as bleaching powder (or chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone, one of them is sufficient);   By distillation, raising the temperature can also denature proteins, which has a disinfecting effect and can also remove other impurities from the water;   Therefore, the answer is: Bleaching powder (or chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone, one of them is sufficient) Distillation;   (3) The mass of the solute remains constant before and after dilution. Let the mass of the 15% peracetic acid solution needed be x,   then 15%x = 300text{kg} times 0.5%, x = 10text{kg}   The main steps of preparation are: First, calculate the mass of the peracetic acid solution and water needed based on the mass of the solute = mass of the solution × mass fraction of the solute, convert it to volume, and measure, then mix and dissolve;   Therefore, the answer is: boxed{10}; Calculate, measure (take the volume), dissolve (dilute).   【Analysis】(1) The analysis is based on the properties of molecules. Molecules are very small in volume and mass, constantly in motion, and there are gaps between them. The fact that search and rescue dogs can detect the special scent of human bodies indicates that the molecules of the scent move into the air and are detected by the dogs;   (2) ① After adding flocculants to the new water source for coagulation and settling, it should be filtered to remove the settled matter;   ② The answer is based on the correct operation of using pH paper; Hard water contains high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which can be identified with soap water. If a large amount of precipitate is produced, it is hard water;   ③ The answer is based on substances with strong oxidizing properties that can denature proteins.

For simplicity, let’s assume these digits are positioned in some order, denoted as (M = overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_n}), where each (a_i in {1, 3, 7, 9}) and (1 le i le n). We will consider a 4-digit number formed by adding these four digits to (M).      For example:      [     M_1 = overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_n 1379}     ]     We reformat this setup as:     [     M_1 = M cdot 10^4 + 1379     ]     2. **Checking Modulo 7:** We need to check remainders of possible primes upon division by 7.

Therefore, one of (M_1, M_2, ldots, M_9) must be divisible by 7, and hence, it is not prime. 6. **Conclusion:** This contradiction shows that an absolute prime cannot include four different digits because it cannot maintain its prime status under all permutations of these digits. Thus, an absolute prime can have at most 3 different digits. (boxed{})"},{"instruction":"Anton, Vasya, Sasha, and Dima were driving from city A to city B, each taking turns at the wheel.

Substituting T = pi gives us omega = frac{2pi}{pi} = 2. Next, we use the \\"five-point method\\" to determine varphi. We know that the lines x = frac{pi}{6} and x = frac{2pi}{3} are axes of symmetry, so we can set up an equation involving omega, varphi, and these points. We have 2 times frac{pi}{6} + varphi = -frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. Solving for varphi gives varphi = -frac{5pi}{6} + 2kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. Therefore, the function can be rewritten as f(x) = sin(2x - frac{5pi}{6} + 2kpi). Since adding 2kpi (where k is an integer) does not change the value of the sine function, we simplify this to f(x) = sin(2x - frac{5pi}{6}). To find fleft(-frac{5pi}{12}right), we substitute x = -frac{5pi}{12} into the simplified function: begin{align*} fleft(-frac{5pi}{12}right) &= sinleft(2left(-frac{5pi}{12}right) - frac{5pi}{6}right)  &= sinleft(-frac{5pi}{6} - frac{5pi}{6}right)  &= sinleft(-frac{5pi}{3}right)  &= sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right)  &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. end{align*} Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"f point A(a, 2) and point B(1, b) are symmetric with respect to the yaxis, then left(a+bright)^{2023}=______.","output":"Given that point A(a, -2) and point B(-1, b) are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, we can deduce the coordinates of A and B based on symmetry properties.

Knowing that a > 0, it implies e^{a} > 1, thus 1-ln b > 1, leading to -ln b > 0 and therefore 0 < b < 1.  Choosing b=frac{1}{e} as a test case, we find e^{a}-1=1, which simplifies to a=ln 2. Since ln 2 > frac{1}{e}, we have ln(ln 2) > ln(frac{1}{e})=-1. Therefore, at this point, ln a+e^{b} > -1+e^{b} > -1+1=0. This shows that statement A is incorrect. **Step 2: Analyzing Statement B** Consider the function f(x)=e^{x}-x-1. The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), is e^{x}-1. For x > 0, f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing. For x < 0, f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, for all x, f(x) geqslant f(0), which simplifies to e^{x} geqslant x+1.  Applying this to a > 0, we get e^{a} > a+1, and thus 1=e^{a}+ln b > a+1+ln b. This simplifies to a+ln b < 0, making statement B correct. **Step 3: Analyzing Statement C** From e^{x} geqslant x+1, we derive x geqslant ln(x+1), which further implies x-1 geqslant ln x (equality holds when x=1). Given 0 < b < 1, it follows that ln b < b-1, and thus 1=e^{a}+ln b < e^{a}+b-1. This simplifies to e^{a}+b > 2, making statement C correct. **Step 4: Analyzing Statement D** Given e^{a}=1-ln b=lnfrac{e}{b}, we find a=ln(lnfrac{e}{b}). Therefore, a+b=ln(lnfrac{e}{b})+b. Letting lnfrac{e}{b}=x, we find b=e^{1-x} and x > 1. Thus, a+b=ln x+e^{1-x}.  Define h(x)=ln x+e^{1-x}, and note that for x > 1, h'(x)=frac{1}{x}-e^{1-x}=frac{1}{x}-frac{e}{e^{x}}=frac{e^{x}-ex}{xe^{x}}. Let u(x)=e^{x}-ex, then for x > 1, u'(x)=e^{x}-e > 0. This implies u(x) is monotonically increasing for x > 1, and thus u(x) > u(1)=0. Therefore, h'(x) > 0, indicating h(x) is monotonically increasing for x > 1.

Similarly, ( G ) being the centroid ensures proportionality in line intersections with medians. 6. **Collinearity and Midpoint Connection**:     Since ( G neq P ), we examine the midline ( EP parallel XG ) and ( FP parallel YG ). By considering the similarity of triangles and parallel line properties, ( P ) acts as an intersection point ensuring symmetry over ( X, Y, ) and centroid ( G ). 7. **Equality of Triangle Areas**:     Through area considerations, the regions ( triangle PEG, triangle PXG, triangle PYG ) comply with ( G ) dividing medians, ensuring that ( GP ) bisects ( XY ). 8. **Conclusion**:     As per the derivation, ( GP ) bisects ( XY ) confirming that midpoint criteria are met.

Thus, the total cost y is: [ y = 90a + 135(30-a) = 90a + 4050 - 135a = -45a + 4050 ] Since the quantity of type B snail noodles is not less than the quantity of type A snail noodles, we have a leq 15. As the coefficient of a in the cost equation is negative (-45 < 0), the cost y decreases as a increases. Therefore, to minimize the cost, a should be as large as possible, which means a = 15.

We will use the lemmas provided in the solution to guide our calculations.  Lemma 1:  The ratio between k^3 and (k+1)^3 decreases as k increases. This can be shown by considering the function f(k) = frac{(k+1)^3}{k^3} = left(1 + frac{1}{k}right)^3. As k increases, frac{1}{k} decreases, hence f(k) approaches 1.  Lemma 2:  If the range (n, mn] includes y cubes, then (p, mp] will always contain at least y-1 cubes for all p geq n. This follows from the fact that the cubes grow more slowly as k increases, and the interval (p, mp] expands linearly with p.  Analysis for m > 14: For m = 14, the range (1, 14] includes the cube 2^3 = 8. The range (2, 28] includes the cubes 3^3 = 27 and 2^3 = 8. By Lemma 2, for any m > 14, the range (1, m] will include at least one cube, and (2, 2m] will include at least two cubes. Thus, Q(m) = 1 for all m > 14.  Calculation of sum_{m=2}^{2017} Q(m) mod 1000: Since Q(m) = 1 for m > 14, the sum sum_{m=15}^{2017} Q(m) = 2003 contributes 3 modulo 1000. We need to calculate sum_{m=2}^{14} Q(m).  Detailed calculations for m = 2 to m = 14: - **m = 2:** We find Q(2) = 32 by checking the smallest n such that (n, 2n] contains two cubes. This happens at n = 63. - **m = 3:** We find Q(3) = 9 by checking the smallest n such that (n, 3n] contains two cubes.

This happens at n = 7. - **m = 8 to m = 14:** We find Q(m) = 1 for each of these values of m.

For simplicity, let us denote this common base logarithm by log. Therefore, the given inequality can be rewritten as: [ frac{log a^{2}}{log (b+c)} + frac{log b^{2}}{log (c+a)} + frac{log c^{2}}{log (a+b)} geq 3 ] Since log a^{2} = 2 log a, log b^{2} = 2 log b, and log c^{2} = 2 log c, the inequality becomes: [ 2 left( frac{log a}{log (b+c)} + frac{log b}{log (c+a)} + frac{log c}{log (a+b)} right) geq 3 ] Dividing both sides by 2, [ frac{log a}{log (b+c)} + frac{log b}{log (c+a)} + frac{log c}{log (a+b)} geq frac{3}{2} ] We can use an auxiliary result asserting that: if x, y geq 2, then xy geq x + y.

Now, we apply this theorem to simplify the denominators on the left side of the inequality.  Next, we look at the terms:  [ frac{log a}{log (b+c)}, quad frac{log b}{log (c+a)}, quad frac{log c}{log (a+b)}. ] Given a, b, c geq 2, we know log (b+c) leq log (bc), log (c+a) leq log (ca), and log (a+b) leq log (ab).

Setting f'(x) to zero at x=1, we get:  f'(1) = 12(1)^2 - 2a(1) - 2b = 12 - 2a - 2b = 0  Solving this equation for b, we obtain:  b = frac{12 - 2a}{2} = 6 - a.  Now that we have b in terms of a, to ensure that a > 0 and b > 0 as given in the problem, we must have a < 6.  The extremum requirement also imposes that the second derivative at x=1 must not be zero for a true extremum (maximum or minimum) to exist. Thus:  f''(x) = frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)) = frac{d}{dx}(12x^2 - 2ax - 2b) = 24x - 2a.  Plugging in x=1, we have:  f''(1) = 24(1) - 2a = 24 - 2a.  For f(x) to have a maximum at x=1, we need f''(1) < 0, which yields 24 - 2a < 0, or a > 12. But we must reconcile this with the condition a < 6, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we deduce that x=1 must be a point of minimum, and f''(1) > 0, which means 24 - 2a > 0 or a < 12. This is already true for all a < 6. With a > 0, to maximize ab, we must choose the largest possible a that still satisfies a < 6. Hence, we choose a close to 6 (but not equal to it). Substituting this into the expression for b, we obtain b close to zero (but positive):  b = 6 - a.  To find the maximum product ab, we need to evaluate the expression a(6 - a). This is a downward-opening parabola with respect to a, and its maximum value occurs at the vertex.

This implies that for even functions, f(-x) = f(x), and for odd functions, f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, the symmetry about the point (1,0) for f(x+1) being odd translates to the even function f(x) in a specific manner, leading to f(0)+f(2)=0 because of this symmetry. Additionally, we're given that f(1)=0, which directly implies that a+b=0 when substituting x=1 into f(x)=frac{a}{x}+b. Furthermore, since f(0)+f(2)=0 and given the function form f(x)=frac{a}{x}+b for x in [1,2], we can extrapolate f(2) = frac{a}{2} + b. Therefore, f(0) = -(frac{a}{2} + b). Together with the condition f(0)+f(1)=-4, and knowing f(1)=0, we find f(0)=-4. This leads us to the equation frac{a}{2}+b=4. Solving the system of equations: begin{align*} a + b &= 0  frac{a}{2} + b &= 4 end{align*} We can subtract the first equation from twice the second to eliminate b and solve for a, then substitute back to find b: begin{align*} a &= -8  b &= 8 end{align*} Given f(x) is an even function, f(-x) = f(x), so f(-frac{1}{2}) = f(frac{1}{2}).

Since the perimeter is 8, we can write 4a = 8, leading to a = 2. Then using the eccentricity formula, we get e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}} = frac{1}{2}. Squaring both sides and solving for b^2 gives b^2 = a^2(1 - e^2) = 4 times frac{3}{4} = 3.  Hence, the equation of the ellipse C is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1}. **(2)** To find out whether the distance from O to line AB is a constant, consider two cases: the slope of AB being undefined (vertical line) and having a defined slope (non-vertical line). For a vertical line, let's take points A and B to be (x_0, y_0) and (x_0, -y_0), respectively. Since A and B lie on the ellipse, we have frac{x_0^2}{4} + frac{y_0^2}{3} = 1. Without loss of generality, we can assume that x_0 = sqrt{frac{12}{7}}. The distance d from point O to line AB is independent of y value and is given by d = |x_0| = frac{2sqrt{21}}{7}. For a non-vertical line, if the equation of AB is y = kx + m, for points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) on the ellipse, we combine the line equation with the ellipse equation to get a quadratic equation for x: (3+4k^2)x^2 + 8kmx + 4m^2 - 12 = 0. Using the discriminant Delta, and ensuring that Delta > 0 for real intersections, we find that x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8km}{3+4k^2}, and x_1x_2 = frac{4m^2 - 12}{3+4k^2}. Since OA is perpendicular to OB, we have 0 = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2. Plugging in the values for y_1 and y_2 as kx_1 + m and kx_2 + m, and rearranging gives: [ (k^2 + 1) frac{4m^2 - 12}{3 + 4k^2} - frac{8k^2m^2}{3 + 4k^2} + m^2 = 0 ] Solving for m^2 yields 7m^2 = 12(k^2 + 1), thus confirming Delta > 0. Therefore, the distance d from point O to line AB is d = frac{|m|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = sqrt{frac{12}{7}} = frac{2sqrt{21}}{7}, which is a constant value.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, we have: [AE^2 = AC^2 - EC^2.] Substituting EC = frac{1}{2}BC, we get: [AE^2 = AC^2 - left(frac{1}{2}BCright)^2.] The Law of Cosines in triangle AEC gives: [cos angle AEC = frac{AC^2 + EC^2 - AE^2}{2 cdot AC cdot EC}.] Substituting AE^2 and EC, we get: [cos angle AEC = frac{AC^2 + left(frac{1}{2}BCright)^2 - left(AC^2 - left(frac{1}{2}BCright)^2right)}{2 cdot AC cdot frac{1}{2}BC} = boxed{1}.]"},{"instruction":"The distance between two parallel lines 2x+3y3=0 and 2x+3y+2=0 is ______.","output":"To find the distance d between two parallel lines, we can use the standard distance formula for parallel lines given by: [ d = frac{|c_1 - c_2|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ] where the equations of the lines are in the form Ax+By+c=0.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to pick 2 people out of the 16 to quit. This can be done using the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of people, and r is the number of people to choose. For our case, n=16 and r=2, so we have: [ binom{16}{2} = frac{16!}{2!(16-2)!} = frac{16 times 15}{2 times 1} = 120 ] Next, we calculate the number of ways for both quitters to be from the same tribe. Since there are two tribes, we calculate this for one tribe and then multiply by 2 (since the calculation is the same for both tribes). For one tribe, with n=8 and r=2, we have: [ binom{8}{2} = frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = frac{8 times 7}{2 times 1} = 28 ] Since there are two tribes, the total number of ways for both quitters to be from the same tribe is: [ 28 text{ (first tribe)} + 28 text{ (second tribe)} = 56 ] Finally, to find the probability that both quitters are from the same tribe, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: [ frac{56}{120} = frac{7}{15} ] Therefore, the probability that both people who quit are from the same tribe is boxed{frac{7}{15}}."},{"instruction":"Consider several black and white chips placed in a circle.

To determine whether there can be exactly one chip left after each player has made two moves, we need to understand the functioning of the removal process. The first player removes all black chips adjacent to at least one white chip, and the second player removes all white chips adjacent to at least one black chip. 1. Since the total number of chips is even (40), after each player's turn, the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of chips must remain consistent. Therefore, after the first player removes some chips, there will still be an even number of chips. Consequently, the second player’s action of removing some chips will also result in an even number of remaining chips. 2. After two full rounds (one round equals each player moving once), it's impossible for the quantity to change from an even number to an odd number.  **Conclusion:** It cannot happen that exactly one chip (1) remains on the circle after each player makes two moves because one can never reach an odd number of 1 from an even number of 40 chips.  boxed{text{No}}  # Part (b) **Problem:** Given that initially there were 1000 chips, determine the minimum number of moves necessary to leave exactly one chip on the circle.

When f'(x) < 0, we get 0 < x < frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 + 16}}{8}. When f'(x) > 0, we get x > frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 + 16}}{8}. Thus, the function's monotonically decreasing interval is (0, frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 + 16}}{8}), and the monotonically increasing interval is (frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 + 16}}{8}, +∞). 2. From (1), we know f'(x) = frac{4x^2 + ax - 1}{x^2}. Let g(x) = 4x² + ax - 1. Since g(0) = -1 < 0, when -3 < a < 0, g(frac{1}{2}) = frac{a}{2} < 0, and g(1) = 3 + a > 0.

We want to determine the largest possible value for ( d ), where ( d ) represents the minimum absolute difference between the sum of the weights of a chosen subset of rocks and 10 kilograms. 2. Given:    - The total weight of all rocks is 100 kilograms.    - Each rock weighs no more than 2 kilograms. 3. To maximize ( d ), we should consider rocks that weigh as close to 2 kilograms as possible. However, 5 rocks each weighing 2 kilograms would have a total weight of 10 kilograms, making the difference from 10 kilograms zero, which won't be useful in maximizing ( d ). 4. Suppose the weight of each rock is ( x ). We aim to maximize ( d = 10 - 5x ).

Considering subsets where the total weight ( M ) is greater than 10 kilograms but becomes less than 10 kilograms if any one rock is removed:    [    M > 10 + frac{10}{11} = frac{120}{11}    ]    Removing one rock weighing ( x_i ), we obtain:    [    M - x_i < 10 - frac{10}{11} = frac{100}{11}    ]    Combining these:    [    x_i > frac{20}{11}, quad text{and since} quad x_i leq 2    ]    We must have rocks such that:    [    10 geq x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 > 5 times frac{20}{11}    ]    This simplifies as follows:    [    10 > frac{100}{11} = 9.0909 ldots    ] 8. The inequality indicates that the difference of these 5 rocks' total weight from 10 kilograms is less than ( frac{10}{11} ), leading to a contradiction with the assumption ( D > frac{10}{11} ). 9.

Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are 9 possibilities for the thousands digit (1 through 9). To meet the criteria of the sum of the digits being divisible by 3, we calculate each potential combination: - If the thousands digit and hundreds digit together are divisible by 3, adding any of the combinations resulting in 00, 25, 50, or 75 (since 0+0=0, 2+5=7, 5+0=5, 7+5=12, and 12 is divisible by 3) will work.  Consider thousands digit sums: - Example sum check for 1500 (where thousands digit = 1, hundreds digit can be adjusted to make sum divisible by 3): 1+5+0+0 = 6, okay. - So, for each valid thousands digit setting, we must check if a valid hundreds digit (0 through 9) can maintain the sum's divisibility by 3. With 9 choices for thousands, 10 choices for hundreds, and 4 choices for the last two digits, these are filtered by the sum requirement, leading to more complex case-by-case validation.

Beth took 40% of 250 photographs: 0.40 * 250 = 100 photographs I took 35% of 250 photographs: 0.35 * 250 = 87.5 photographs Since we can't take half a photograph, let's round this to 88 photographs. Julia took the remaining 25% of 250 photographs: 0.25 * 250 = 62.5 photographs Again, rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 63 photographs. Now, let's calculate the total number of photographs we already have: 100 (Beth) + 88 (Me) + 63 (Julia) = 251 photographs We need a total of 650 photographs, so the number of additional photographs needed is: 650 - 251 = 399 photographs Now, let's calculate how many photographs each person will take today, given the percentage decrease in their productivity: Beth will take 35% fewer photographs than yesterday, so she will take: 100 - (0.35 * 100) = 100 - 35 = 65 photographs I will take 45% fewer photographs than yesterday, so I will take: 88 - (0.45 * 88) = 88 - 39.6 = 48.4 photographs Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 48 photographs. Julia will take 25% fewer photographs than yesterday, so she will take: 63 - (0.25 * 63) = 63 - 15.75 = 47.25 photographs Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 47 photographs.

We have 6-x-x^2 > 0. First, let's rearrange it into a quadratic form, x^2 + x - 6 < 0. Step 2: Find the roots of the corresponding equation. To find the roots of the equation x^2 + x - 6 = 0, we can factor it: (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0. Thus, the roots are x = -3 and x = 2. Step 3: Determine the domain. Since we need the quadratic to be less than 0, this implies that the function is defined between the roots.

A photoelectric eye by the side of the road counts the number of cars that pass in one hour. Assuming that each car is 4 meters long and that the cars can travel at any speed, let M be the maximum whole number of cars that can pass the photoelectric eye in one hour. Find the quotient when M is divided by 10.","output":"To solve this problem, we first define the variables and the situation clearly: - Let n be the number of car lengths that separate each car. Given this, the speed of the cars can be at most 15n kilometers per hour. - We define a \\"unit\\" as the distance from the front of one car to the front of the next car. This means the length of each unit is the length of a car (4 meters) plus the distance of n car lengths between cars. Therefore, the length of each unit is 4(n + 1) meters. To maximize the number of cars passing the photoelectric eye in one hour, we consider the cars passing as a continuous flow. At time zero, the front of the first car is right at the eye. We aim to calculate the maximum number of such units (cars plus the space between them) that can pass the eye in one hour. The speed of the cars is 15n kilometers per hour, which is equivalent to 15,000n meters per hour. Dividing this speed by the length of a unit gives us the number of units that can pass the eye in an hour: [ frac{15,000n, text{meters/hour}}{4(n + 1), text{meters/unit}} = frac{15,000n}{4(n + 1)}, text{units/hour}. ] To find the maximum number of cars, we consider the limit of this expression as n approaches infinity. This approach helps us understand the behavior of the function as the space between cars becomes negligible compared to the number of cars: [ lim_{nrightarrow infty}frac{15,000n}{4(n + 1)} = lim_{nrightarrow infty}frac{15,000}{4} = 3750, text{units/hour}. ] Since the speed of the cars is finite, we cannot actually achieve exactly 3750 units in an hour. However, we are interested in the maximum whole number of cars, M, that can pass in one hour. By carefully adjusting the speed, we can ensure that the 3750th car passes the eye just before the hour is up, without all of the space behind it needing to pass. Therefore, the maximum whole number of cars, M, that can pass the photoelectric eye in one hour is 3750.

Each student in the class can be associated with the set of all days on which that student went swimming. Hence, this corresponds to a collection of (m) non-empty subsets of (X_{30}). According to the problem's conditions, every student had a distinct number of swimming days. Moreover, for any two students (i) and (j), there is at least one day (d) such that: - Student (i) went swimming on day (d) and student (j) did not. - Student (j) went swimming on day (d') and student (i) did not. We need to determine the maximum value of (m), the number of students. 1. **Derive Constraints**: We first show that there cannot be more than 28 students. Assume for contradiction that (m geq 29). If there are subsets of sizes (1, 2, ldots, 29), note that any subset with size 29 would necessarily contain every smaller subset’s elements (violating the condition). 2. **Posit Good Subset Family**: We need a “good” subset family where: - Each subset has a unique number of elements. - No subset is contained in another. Such a family must not exceed 28 distinct subsets in (X_{30}). 3. **Existence Proof via Induction**: We establish by induction that a good subset family of 28 subsets exists in (X_{30}). **Base Case**: For (k = 2); A good subset family in (X_2) is ({ {1}, {2} }). **Inductive Step**: Assume a good subset family of (2k-2) subsets exists in (X_{2k}). Extend (X_{2k}) to (X_{2k+2}) with the subsets: [ { B_1 cup {2k+2}, B_2 cup {2k+2}, ldots, B_{2k-2} cup {2k+2} } ] Additionally consider: [ A_1 = {2k+1, 2k+2}, quad A_{2k} = {1, 2, ldots, 2k+1} ] This forms a good subset family in (X_{2k+2}), maintaining the requisite properties. 4. **Conclusion**: By inductive construction, we confirm that there is a good subset family of 28 subsets in (X_{30}).

To find 5 integers such that any pair's product, divided by 12, gives a distinct remainder:    - We can restrict our search to the integers from 1 to 11, excluding 0 because multiplying by 0 always yields 0.    - The chosen integers must all be distinct. 2. We need ten two-factor products (for five numbers (a, b, c, d, e)):    - (ab, ac, ad, ae)    - (bc, bd, be)    - (cd, ce)    - (de) 3. The possible remainders when these products are divided by 12 are 0 through 11. Selecting 10 different products from these numbers will always include both even and odd remainders. 4. Even products yield even remainders due to the property that 12 is even. We share examples:    - If a number is divisible by 4 (as 12 is divisible by 4) and multiplied by any integer, the resulting product's remainder will be divisible by 4, restricting us further. 5. Because of the even requirement and limited availability of divisible by 4 numbers within 1 to 11 (only 4, 8), it is evident from counting arguments that finding five numbers (a, b, c, d, e) such that all ten products give distinct remainders modulo 12 is impossible.  Case II: M = 14 1. To find 5 integers such that any pair's product, divided by 14, gives a distinct remainder:    - We can restrict our search to the integers from 1 to 13, excluding 0 and 7 because multiplying by 0 always yields 0, and any integer times 7 gives a remainder divisible by 7. 2. The possible remainders when products are divided by 14 must exclude 0 and 7:    - Possible remainders: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 3. Working through combinations of integers, we can choose:    - One even number among 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.    - Four odd numbers among 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13. 4. The odd number combinations can be verified by constructing a remainder table modulo 14:    - Example chosen sequence: (a = 6, b = 1, c = 3, d = 5, e = 13).    - The products (ab, ac, ad, ae, bc, bd, be, cd, ce, de) give distinct remainders. 5.
